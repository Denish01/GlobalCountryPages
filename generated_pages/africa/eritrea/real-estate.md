The Eritrean property market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern buildings, with a growing demand for housing and commercial spaces. The market is largely driven by the government's efforts to develop the country's infrastructure and economy. The current market conditions are marked by a shortage of supply, particularly in the capital city of Asmara, which has led to an increase in prices. The trend is expected to continue, with prices rising steadily over the next few years. The urban areas, such as Asmara and Massawa, are more developed and have a higher demand for property, while the rural areas are relatively underdeveloped.

The government has been investing in the development of new housing projects and infrastructure, which is expected to boost the property market. The market is also expected to benefit from the country's strategic location, with its ports and trade routes connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa. However, the market is also faced with challenges, such as a lack of financing options and a limited number of skilled professionals in the construction industry.

The price trajectory of the property market in Eritrea is expected to continue rising, driven by the growing demand for housing and commercial spaces. The government's efforts to develop the country's infrastructure and economy are also expected to contribute to the growth of the market. However, the market is still in its early stages of development, and there are many opportunities for growth and investment.
