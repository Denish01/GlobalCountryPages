        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Eritrea is a country located in the Horn of Africa, situated on the <strong>Red Sea</strong> coast. It borders three countries: Sudan to the west, Ethiopia to the south, and Djibouti to the southeast. The country's strategic location allows it to control the <strong>Bab-el-Mandeb Strait</strong>, a vital shipping lane that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. Eritrea's coastline stretches for approximately 1,151 kilometers, providing access to the <strong>Red Sea</strong> and its many ports.</p>
        <p>The country's borders have played a significant role in shaping its history, with Eritrea having been an Italian colony from 1889 to 1941. After World War II, Eritrea was administered by the British, and later it became a federation with Ethiopia. However, Eritrea declared its independence in 1993, following a long and bloody struggle. Today, the country continues to maintain a delicate balance with its neighbors, with whom it has had tense relationships in the past. The border with Ethiopia, in particular, has been a source of conflict, with the two countries having clashed over territorial disputes.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Eritrea's terrain is characterized by a mix of <strong>mountains</strong>, <strong>deserts</strong>, and <strong>coastal plains</strong>. The central highlands, which include the <strong>Eritrean Highlands</strong>, are home to the country's highest peak, <strong>Soira</strong>, which rises to an elevation of 3,018 meters. The highlands are also where the capital city, <strong>Asmara</strong>, is located. The terrain in this region is rugged, with steep slopes and deep valleys. The <strong>Danakil Depression</strong>, which is located in the southeastern part of the country, is one of the hottest and most inhospitable places on Earth, with temperatures often reaching as high as 64°C (147°F).</p>
        <p>The coastal region, which borders the Red Sea, is generally flat and arid, with <strong>deserts</strong> and <strong>semi-deserts</strong> dominating the landscape. The <strong> Dahlak Archipelago</strong>, which is located off the coast of Eritrea, is a group of islands that are known for their coral reefs and diverse marine life. The islands are also home to a number of historic sites, including ancient ports and trading centers. The <strong>Setit River</strong>, which forms part of the border with Ethiopia, is one of the country's most important waterways, providing water for irrigation and drinking.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Eritrean coastline</strong> is also home to a number of <strong>beaches</strong> and <strong>ports</strong>, including the port city of <strong>Massawa</strong>, which is one of the country's most important economic centers. The city has a rich history, having been an important trading center for centuries. Today, it is a major hub for the country's fishing and shipping industries. The coastline is also home to a number of <strong>national parks</strong> and <strong>protected areas</strong>, which are designed to preserve the country's unique biodiversity.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>In addition to its mountains, deserts, and coastal plains, Eritrea is also home to a number of <strong>rivers</strong> and <strong>lakes</strong>. The <strong>Setit River</strong>, which forms part of the border with Ethiopia, is one of the country's most important waterways, providing water for irrigation and drinking. The <strong>Anseba River</strong>, which is located in the western part of the country, is another important river, providing water for agriculture and livestock. The <strong>Lake Kulul</strong>, which is located in the northern part of the country, is a saltwater lake that is known for its unique biodiversity.</p>
