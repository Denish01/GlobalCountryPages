[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Eritrea's transportation system is relatively underdeveloped, with limited options for public transit. The majority of the population relies on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around, which can be affordable but often crowded. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with the capital city Asmara having a slightly more developed system than other parts of the country. In rural areas, transportation options are often limited, and people may have to rely on **walking** or **cycling** as their primary mode of transportation.

The main transportation modes in Eritrea include **buses**, **minibuses**, and **taxis**, which are available in most cities and towns. However, the frequency and reliability of these services can be inconsistent, and passengers may have to wait for long periods of time for a bus or taxi to arrive. Additionally, the roads in Eritrea can be in poor condition, especially during the rainy season, which can make travel times longer and more unpredictable.
