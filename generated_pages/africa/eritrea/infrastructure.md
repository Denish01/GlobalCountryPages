[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Eritrea's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, and the country faces numerous challenges in providing basic services to its population. Recent investments have focused on rebuilding and expanding the country's infrastructure, including roads, ports, and energy generation. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant issue, with cities like Asmara and Massawa having better access to services than rural areas. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural energy and water supply systems.

The country's infrastructure development has been hindered by decades of conflict and international sanctions, which have limited access to funding and technology. Despite these challenges, Eritrea has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in the energy, transportation, and water sectors. The government has also prioritized the development of **public-private partnerships** to attract foreign investment and expertise.

Eritrea's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic growth and poverty reduction strategies. The government has recognized the importance of investing in infrastructure to promote economic development, improve living standards, and reduce poverty. As a result, infrastructure development has become a key priority, with a focus on building a more resilient and sustainable infrastructure system.
