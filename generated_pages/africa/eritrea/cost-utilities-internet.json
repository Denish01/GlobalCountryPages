  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Eritrea can vary, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $50 to $100 USD, while internet plans with 60 Mbps speed can cost around $30 to $50 USD per month.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($70 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($40 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: ERN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nEritrea's utility infrastructure is still developing, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. The cost of utilities in Eritrea can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the progress is slow, and the costs remain relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe utility costs in Eritrea are also affected by the country's economic situation, with the local currency, ERN, experiencing inflation and devaluation. This can lead to higher costs for imported goods, including fuel and equipment, which are used to generate electricity and provide other utility services. As a result, the costs of utilities in Eritrea can be unpredictable and may change suddenly, making it challenging for residents and businesses to budget and plan for their utility expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in rent or separate |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$90** | **$130** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | EriTel, Zain |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-50 | 60 Mbps | EriTel, Zain |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | EriTel, Zain |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | EriTel, Zain |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-70 | varies | EriTel, Zain |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available with international payment |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available with international payment |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Eritrea, residents typically need to visit the local utility office and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help residents budget and control their energy usage.\n- EriTel and Zain are the main internet and phone service providers in Eritrea, offering a range of plans and packages.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can consider using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and negotiating with landlords to include utility costs in the rent.\n- It is also recommended to check with the local utility providers for any promotions or discounts that may be available, especially for long-term contracts or bundle deals.",
