[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Eritrea has a tropical **desert climate** with two main seasons: a dry season and a wet season. The dry season, which lasts from October to April, is characterized by low humidity and mild temperatures, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which occurs from May to September, is marked by high temperatures and heavy rainfall, making travel more challenging. The country's **climate zones** vary from the hot and dry coastal regions to the cooler and more temperate highlands, where the capital city Asmara is located. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's historic sites, beaches, and national parks.

The dry season is also the best time to explore Eritrea's **cultural heritage**, including its historic cities, museums, and festivals. The cooler weather makes it ideal for walking tours, hiking, and other outdoor activities. In contrast, the wet season can make travel more difficult, with heavy rainfall and flash flooding common in some areas. However, the wet season is also a time of **agricultural abundance**, with many crops being harvested during this period.

Eritrea's **geography** also plays a significant role in shaping its climate and seasons. The country's **mountainous regions** receive more rainfall than the coastal areas, making them more prone to landslides and flash flooding during the wet season. In contrast, the coastal regions are generally hotter and drier, with very little rainfall during the dry season.
