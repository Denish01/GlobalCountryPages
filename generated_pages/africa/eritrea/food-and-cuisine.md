[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Eritrean cuisine is a unique blend of African, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern flavors, reflecting the country's strategic location and cultural heritage. The cuisine is characterized by the use of **injera**, a sourdough flatbread made from **teff** flour, which is used to scoop up various stews and salads. Eritrean cuisine has been influenced by its neighbors, including Ethiopia and Sudan, as well as by Italian and Arabic cultures. Regional variations exist, with the coastal region of Eritrea having a more Mediterranean-influenced cuisine, while the highlands have a more traditional, Ethiopian-influenced cuisine.

The use of spices and chilies is common in Eritrean cooking, with **berbere**, a spicy chili powder, being a staple ingredient. **Niter kibbeh**, a type of clarified butter, is also widely used to add flavor to dishes. Eritrean cuisine is often served family-style, with a variety of dishes placed in the center of the table for everyone to share. Mealtimes are social occasions, and food plays an important role in Eritrean culture and hospitality.

Eritrean cuisine is also known for its street food and snacks, which are widely available in markets and from street vendors. Popular snacks include **sambusas**, fried or baked pastries filled with spiced potatoes or lentils, and **ful medames**, a dish made from fava beans, garlic, and lemon juice. Eritrean cuisine is a reflection of the country's rich cultural heritage and its strategic location at the crossroads of Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean.
