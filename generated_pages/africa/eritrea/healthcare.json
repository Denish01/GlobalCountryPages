The public sector is the main provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the quality of care and access to services vary significantly, with better-equipped facilities and more skilled healthcare professionals found in urban areas, particularly in the capital, Asmara. In rural areas, healthcare services are often limited, with a shortage of medical supplies, equipment, and trained personnel. The Eritrean government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the construction of new healthcare facilities and the training of healthcare professionals.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Eritrea is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a reliance on private providers, particularly in urban areas. Private healthcare providers offer a range of services, including specialized care and diagnostic testing, but these services are often expensive and out of reach for many Eritreans. Despite these challenges, Eritrea has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes, including reducing child mortality rates and increasing access to immunizations.\n\nEritrea's healthcare system faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical supplies, equipment, and trained healthcare professionals. The country also struggles with a high burden of infectious diseases, including **tuberculosis**, **malaria**, and **HIV/AIDS**.
