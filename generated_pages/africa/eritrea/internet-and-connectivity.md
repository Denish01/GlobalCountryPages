[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Eritrea is characterized by slow speeds and limited availability, with the average internet speed being around 2 Mbps download. This makes it difficult to perform even basic online tasks, such as browsing and emailing. The urban-rural divide is also evident, with **Asmara**, the capital city, having slightly better internet connectivity than the rest of the country. However, even in urban areas, the internet is often unreliable and prone to outages, making it a challenge for businesses and individuals to stay connected.

The Eritrean government has strict control over the internet, which contributes to the limited availability and poor quality of internet services. The government has been known to block access to certain websites and restrict online freedom, making it essential for tourists and remote workers to be aware of these limitations before traveling to the country. Despite these challenges, there are some efforts to improve internet connectivity in Eritrea, with the government investing in new infrastructure and **telecommunication** projects.
