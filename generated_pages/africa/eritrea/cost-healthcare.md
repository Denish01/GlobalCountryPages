[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Eritrea's healthcare system is a mixed system, with both public and private healthcare providers operating in the country. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, while the private healthcare system is more developed and offers better quality services, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare services. While health insurance is not required, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as the cost of medical care can be high, and medical evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of serious illness or injury.

The healthcare system in Eritrea is also faced with challenges such as a shortage of medical professionals, limited access to healthcare services in rural areas, and a lack of specialized medical care. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the construction of new hospitals and health centers, and the implementation of programs to increase access to healthcare services. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas, and between public and private healthcare services.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are generally available at pharmacies, with prices ranging from $5-$10.
- Prescription rules are often limited, and many medications are available over-the-counter.
- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.
- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but the quality and authenticity of these medications can be a concern.
- Prices for medications can vary significantly depending on the location and type of pharmacy.
- It is recommended to purchase medications from reputable pharmacies and to always check the expiration dates and packaging.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In case of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 113, or to go directly to the nearest hospital. However, it is important to note that emergency services are often limited, and medical care may not be available in all areas. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private hospitals, such as the **Orotta Hospital** in Asmara, which offers more advanced medical services and better care. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for medical evacuation to another country, in case of serious illness or injury, as medical care in Eritrea may not be sufficient to treat all conditions. Additionally, it is a good idea to research and identify local medical facilities and emergency services before traveling to Eritrea, and to always carry a list of emergency contact numbers and medical information.
