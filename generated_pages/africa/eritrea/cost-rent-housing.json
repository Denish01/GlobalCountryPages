The rental market is largely unregulated, and lease terms can vary significantly depending on the landlord and the location. Typically, a one-year lease is required, and a deposit of one to two months' rent is expected. Tenant rights are limited, and renters often have to negotiate with landlords to resolve disputes. Compared to its regional neighbors, Eritrea's housing costs are relatively moderate, with Sudan and Ethiopia having more expensive housing markets, while Djibouti's housing market is more expensive due to its strategic location.\n\nThe Eritrean government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the construction of new apartments and the renovation of existing buildings. However, the demand for housing still outstrips supply, particularly in urban areas. As a result, rents can be high, especially for apartments in desirable locations. Expats and foreigners may find it challenging to navigate the housing market, particularly due to language barriers and limited information available. It is essential to work with a reputable real estate agent or a trusted local contact to find suitable accommodation.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $100-$150 | $50-$100 | Basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $150-$200 | $80-$150 | Furnished, with private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $250-$350 | $150-$250 | Family-sized, with living room and private kitchen |\n| 3 Bedroom | $350-$500 | $250-$350 | Spacious, with multiple living areas and private kitchen |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $500-$1,000 | Prime locations, close to amenities and services |\n| Suburbs | $200-$500 | Residential areas, with access to public transportation |\n| Rural | $50-$200 | Limited amenities, suitable for agricultural or rural development |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Downtown Asmara: $150-$300 per month, historic architecture, vibrant nightlife, and access to amenities\n- Tiravolo: $100-$200 per month, residential area, close to schools and shopping centers\n- Gejeret: $80-$150 per month, suburban area, with a mix of traditional and modern housing\n- Emba Soira: $50-$100 per month, rural area, suitable for those seeking a peaceful and natural environment\n- Mai Habar: $100-$200 per month, upscale neighborhood, with modern amenities and services\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Eritrea [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and work with a reputable real estate agent to find suitable accommodation\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and lease terms, as these can vary significantly\n- Ensure that the apartment is well-maintained and has basic amenities, such as electricity and water\n- Be aware of scams and fake listings, and always inspect the property before signing a lease\n- Utilities, such as electricity and water, are usually not included in the rent, and tenants are expected to pay these separately\n- Furnished apartments are less common, and tenants may need to provide their own furniture and appliances\n- Learn some basic **Tigrinya** phrases to communicate with landlords and locals, and consider working with a local contact to facilitate the rental process.",
