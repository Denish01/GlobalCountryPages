  "content": "The infrastructure in Eritrea is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, including limited access to electricity, poor road conditions, and inadequate water and sanitation systems. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 47% of population\nInternet Penetration: 6%\nRoad Network: 4,010 km, poor quality\nRail Network: 118 km\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nEritrea's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, and the country faces numerous challenges in providing basic services to its population. Recent investments have focused on rebuilding and expanding the country's infrastructure, including roads, ports, and energy generation. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant issue, with cities like Asmara and Massawa having better access to services than rural areas. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural energy and water supply systems.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development has been hindered by decades of conflict and international sanctions, which have limited access to funding and technology. Despite these challenges, Eritrea has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in the energy, transportation, and water sectors. The government has also prioritized the development of **public-private partnerships** to attract foreign investment and expertise.\n\nEritrea's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic growth and poverty reduction strategies. The government has recognized the importance of investing in infrastructure to promote economic development, improve living standards, and reduce poverty. As a result, infrastructure development has become a key priority, with a focus on building a more resilient and sustainable infrastructure system.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 4,010 km | Poor | Many roads are unpaved and in disrepair |\n| Railways | 118 km | Moderate | Limited rail network, mostly used for freight |\n| Airports | 4 international, 2 domestic | Good | Asmara International Airport is the main hub |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Massawa and Assab are the main ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Eritrea's power generation is primarily based on **thermal energy**, with some contributions from **renewable energy sources** like wind and solar.\n- The country's electricity grid is unreliable, with frequent **power outages** and **blackouts**.\n- Eritrea has made progress in increasing its **electricity access**, with 47% of the population now having access to electricity.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to promote **energy efficiency** and reduce energy consumption.\n- Eritrea has also explored the potential for **geothermal energy** development, with several projects currently underway.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **safe drinking water** is a significant challenge in Eritrea, particularly in rural areas.\n- The country's **sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many households lacking access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- Eritrea has made progress in increasing **water access** in rural areas, with several projects focusing on the development of rural water supply systems.\n- The government has also implemented initiatives to promote **hygiene and sanitation** practices, particularly in schools and healthcare facilities.\n- Eritrea has also explored the potential for **water harvesting** and **conservation** to address water scarcity issues.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Eritrea's **mobile phone coverage** is relatively good, with several operators providing services across the country.\n- The country's **internet penetration** is limited, with only 6% of the population having access to the internet.\n- Eritrea has made progress in expanding its **fiber-optic network**, with several projects focusing on the development of high-speed internet services.\n- The government has also implemented initiatives to promote **e-government** and **digital literacy**.\n- Eritrea has also explored the potential for **mobile banking** and **financial inclusion** to promote economic development.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Eritrean government has launched several major infrastructure development projects, including the **Massawa Port Expansion** and the **Asmara Water Supply** project.\n- The **European Union** has provided significant funding for infrastructure development in Eritrea, including the construction of roads and energy generation facilities.\n- The **African Development Bank** has also provided funding for several infrastructure projects in Eritrea, including the development of the country's transportation network.\n- Eritrea has also explored the potential for **public-private partnerships** to attract foreign investment and expertise in the infrastructure sector.\n- The government has also implemented initiatives to promote **sustainable infrastructure development**, with a focus on environmental sustainability and social responsibility.",
