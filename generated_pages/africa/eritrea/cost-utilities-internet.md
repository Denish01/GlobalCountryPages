[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Eritrea's utility infrastructure is still developing, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. The cost of utilities in Eritrea can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the progress is slow, and the costs remain relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

The utility costs in Eritrea are also affected by the country's economic situation, with the local currency, ERN, experiencing inflation and devaluation. This can lead to higher costs for imported goods, including fuel and equipment, which are used to generate electricity and provide other utility services. As a result, the costs of utilities in Eritrea can be unpredictable and may change suddenly, making it challenging for residents and businesses to budget and plan for their utility expenses.
