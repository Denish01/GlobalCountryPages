[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Eritrea has one main international airport, Asmara International Airport (ASM), which is located about 5 kilometers from the capital city of Asmara. The airport receives flights from major hubs in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, including Cairo, Dubai, and Nairobi. Direct flights to Asmara are available from a few cities, including Cairo, Dubai, and Jeddah, but most travelers will need to connect through one of these hubs to reach Eritrea. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings open to travelers from Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti, although these routes may be subject to closures or restrictions due to security concerns.

Travelers can enter Eritrea by land through the border crossings at Tessenei (from Sudan), Barentu (from Ethiopia), or Assab (from Djibouti). However, these routes can be challenging due to poor road conditions and security concerns, and it is recommended to check the current situation before attempting to cross the border by land. Additionally, all travelers entering Eritrea will need to obtain a visa, which can be arranged in advance through the Eritrean embassy or consulate in their home country, or in some cases, upon arrival at Asmara International Airport.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Eritrea has a limited domestic air network, with flights available between Asmara and a few other major cities, including Massawa and Assab. The main domestic airline is Eritrean Airlines, which operates a small fleet of planes and offers flights on a limited schedule. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, as availability can be limited and flights may be subject to cancellation or delay due to weather or other factors. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200 USD, depending on the route and class of service.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Eritrea does not have a functioning rail network, and there are no train services available for passengers. The country's rail infrastructure was largely destroyed during the war for independence, and although there have been efforts to rebuild the rail network, progress has been slow. As a result, travelers will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus services are available in Eritrea, with companies such as Asmara Bus Company and Massawa Bus Company operating routes between major cities. The quality of bus services can vary, with some buses being relatively modern and comfortable, while others may be older and more basic. Fares are generally affordable, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 USD, depending on the route and class of service. However, bus travel can be slow due to poor road conditions, and schedules may be subject to change or cancellation due to weather or other factors.
