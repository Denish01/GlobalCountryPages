[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Eritrea is characterized by a strong centralized authority, with the President holding significant powers. The **separation of powers** is limited, as the President also serves as the head of the ruling party, the **People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ)**. The **National Assembly**, the country's unicameral legislature, has limited powers and is dominated by the PFDJ. Eritrea's political system has been criticized for its lack of **democratic freedoms** and **human rights**. The government has been accused of suppressing opposition and restricting civil liberties.

The **unitary system** of government in Eritrea means that the central government has significant control over the country's six regions, known as **zobas**. The regions have limited autonomy and are responsible for implementing national policies. The government has also established a system of **local councils**, which are responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare and education.

Eritrea's **legal system** is based on a mix of **civil law**, **Islamic law**, and **customary law**. The country has a **Supreme Court**, which is the highest court in the land, and a system of lower courts. However, the **rule of law** is often undermined by the government's arbitrary use of power and the lack of **independent judiciary**.
