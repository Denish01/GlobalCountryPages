It borders three countries: Sudan to the west, Ethiopia to the south, and Djibouti to the southeast. The country's strategic location allows it to control the **Bab-el-Mandeb Strait**, a vital shipping lane that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. Eritrea's coastline stretches for approximately 1,151 kilometers, providing access to the **Red Sea** and its many ports.\n\nThe country's borders have played a significant role in shaping its history, with Eritrea having been an Italian colony from 1889 to 1941. After World War II, Eritrea was administered by the British, and later it became a federation with Ethiopia. However, Eritrea declared its independence in 1993, following a long and bloody struggle. Today, the country continues to maintain a delicate balance with its neighbors, with whom it has had tense relationships in the past. The border with Ethiopia, in particular, has been a source of conflict, with the two countries having clashed over territorial disputes.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nEritrea's terrain is characterized by a mix of **mountains**, **deserts**, and **coastal plains**. The central highlands, which include the **Eritrean Highlands**, are home to the country's highest peak, **Soira**, which rises to an elevation of 3,018 meters. The highlands are also where the capital city, **Asmara**, is located. The terrain in this region is rugged, with steep slopes and deep valleys.

The city has a rich history, having been an important trading center for centuries. Today, it is a major hub for the country's fishing and shipping industries. The coastline is also home to a number of **national parks** and **protected areas**, which are designed to preserve the country's unique biodiversity.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nIn addition to its mountains, deserts, and coastal plains, Eritrea is also home to a number of **rivers** and **lakes**.
