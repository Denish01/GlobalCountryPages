[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Eritrea's population is relatively small compared to other African countries, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 2.4%, which is slightly higher than the global average. The country's urban population accounts for around 40% of the total population, with the majority residing in rural areas. Asmara, the capital city, is the largest urban center, followed by other major cities like Keren and Massawa. Eritrea's population is also characterized by a high fertility rate, with an average of 4.3 children per woman, which contributes to the country's rapid population growth. The population is also relatively young, with a median age of 19.5 years, which presents both opportunities and challenges for the country's development.

The population of Eritrea has been affected by various factors, including migration and urbanization. Many Eritreans have migrated to other countries in search of better economic opportunities, particularly to the Middle East and Europe. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with many Eritreans living and working abroad. However, the country is also experiencing urbanization, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better living conditions and economic opportunities. This trend is expected to continue, with the urban population projected to grow in the coming years.

Eritrea's population growth and urbanization have significant implications for the country's development. The government has been working to improve access to education, healthcare, and other essential services, particularly in rural areas. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including poverty, unemployment, and limited infrastructure. Addressing these challenges will be crucial to ensuring that the population growth is managed sustainably and that the country can reap the benefits of its demographic dividend.
