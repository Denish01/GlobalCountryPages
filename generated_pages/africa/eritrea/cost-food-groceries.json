The cost of food is driven up by factors such as transportation costs, taxes, and the limited availability of certain products. However, eating out is not a common practice in Eritrea, and most people prefer to cook at home using traditional ingredients and recipes. The country's cuisine is heavily influenced by its Ethiopian and Arabic heritage, with popular dishes such as **injera** (sourdough flatbread) and **zigni** (stew) being staples in most households.\n\nThe food culture in Eritrea is centered around traditional meals and home cooking, with most people preparing their own meals using fresh ingredients from local markets. The country's limited economy and lack of infrastructure also mean that the availability of certain products can be limited, and prices can fluctuate depending on the season and availability. However, the use of local ingredients and traditional cooking methods helps to keep food costs relatively low, and meals can be found at affordable prices in most parts of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 45 ERN | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 15 ERN | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 36 ERN | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 30 ERN | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 105 ERN | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00 | 150 ERN | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.00 | 60 ERN | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 24 ERN | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.60 | 18 ERN | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.40 | 12 ERN | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 120 ERN | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50 | 15 ERN | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | (injera, zigni, etc.) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | (one person) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$25 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | (upscale) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $1-$2 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $0.50-$1 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices up to 20% higher than those found at local markets. However, supermarkets often have a wider selection of products, including imported goods, and may offer more convenience and better quality. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices, but the selection may be limited, and the quality can vary. It's generally recommended to buy fresh produce and traditional products at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for imported goods and specialty items.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's common to **bargain** and negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases. Vendors often expect customers to haggle, and it's considered a normal part of the shopping experience. However, it's essential to be respectful and polite when bargaining, and to have a clear idea of the prices you're willing to pay. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have fixed prices, and bargaining is not common.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **cheapest way to eat** is to buy ingredients at local markets and cook at home, with meals starting from around $1-$2 USD per person.\n- **Injera** is a staple food in Eritrea, and it's often served with stews and salads. A batch of injera can cost around $0.50-$1 USD.\n- **Local cheese** is a good value, with prices starting from around $4 USD per kilogram.\n- **Fresh produce** is widely available at local markets, with prices starting from around $0.20-$0.50 USD per kilogram.\n- It's generally **best to avoid buying imported products**, as they can be expensive and may not be fresh. Instead, opt for local alternatives, such as **local beer** and **traditional snacks**.\n- When eating out, consider trying **street food** or **local eateries**, which offer traditional dishes at affordable prices.",
