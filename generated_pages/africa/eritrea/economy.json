The country's economic development has been hindered by various factors, including a long-standing border conflict with Ethiopia, limited access to international markets, and a lack of foreign investment. Eritrea's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with the majority of the population engaged in subsistence farming. The country's economy has been growing slowly, with a GDP growth rate of around 2-3% per annum. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events.\n\nThe Eritrean government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting economic development, including the creation of a free trade zone and the establishment of a national development plan. However, the country's economic progress has been hindered by a lack of infrastructure, including limited access to electricity, water, and transportation networks. The government has also faced criticism for its human rights record and its restrictive economic policies, which have limited the growth of the private sector.\n\nEritrea's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from diaspora communities, with an estimated $400-500 million in remittances flowing into the country each year. The government has implemented various measures to encourage remittances, including the creation of a national remittance system and the provision of incentives for diaspora communities to invest in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Subsistence farming, livestock production, and fishing |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Copper, gold, and zinc mining, with significant potential for growth |\n| Services | 60% of GDP | Government services, trade, and tourism, with a growing informal sector |\n| Manufacturing | 5% of GDP | Textiles, food processing, and construction materials, with limited capacity |\n| Tourism | 2% of GDP | Growing sector, with potential for development, particularly in the coastal regions |\n| Construction | 3% of GDP | Infrastructure development, including roads, bridges, and buildings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Gold**: Eritrea's gold exports have increased significantly in recent years, with the country's gold mines producing an estimated 30,000 ounces per year.\n- **Copper**: Copper is another significant export commodity, with the country's copper mines producing an estimated 10,000 tons per year.\n- **Livestock**: Eritrea exports livestock, including cattle, sheep, and goats, to neighboring countries.\n- **Fish**: The country's fishing industry is also a significant contributor to exports, with fish being exported to countries in the region.\n- **Textiles**: Eritrea's textile industry is small but growing, with the country exporting textiles to countries in the region.\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food**: Eritrea imports significant amounts of food, including wheat, rice, and sugar, due to the country's limited agricultural production.\n- **Fuel**: The country imports fuel, including gasoline and diesel, due to its limited refining capacity.\n- **Machinery**: Eritrea imports machinery, including construction equipment and vehicles, to support the country's infrastructure development.\n- **Electronics**: The country imports electronics, including computers and telecommunications equipment, to support the growing services sector.\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: Eritrea imports pharmaceuticals, including medicines and medical equipment, to support the country's healthcare system.\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- **China**: China is Eritrea's largest trading partner, with significant investments in the country's mining and infrastructure sectors.\n- **Italy**: Italy is another significant trading partner, with historical ties to the country and significant investments in the services sector.\n- **United Arab Emirates**: The UAE is also a key trading partner, with significant investments in the country's construction and logistics sectors.\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Eritrea's transportation network is limited, with only a few paved roads and a small number of airports, including the international airport in Asmara.\n- The country's energy sector is also underdeveloped, with limited access to electricity and a reliance on imported fuel.\n- Internet and mobile penetration are also limited, with only a small percentage of the population having access to these services.\n- The country's ports, including the port of Massawa, are significant for trade, with the potential for growth and development.\n- Eritrea's logistics sector is also underdeveloped, with limited capacity for storage and transportation of goods.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nEritrea's economic outlook is uncertain, with the country facing significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to international markets, and a restrictive business environment.

However, the country's economic progress will depend on its ability to address the significant challenges it faces, including the development of infrastructure, the promotion of private sector growth, and the improvement of the business environment.
