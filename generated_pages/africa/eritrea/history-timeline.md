# Eritrea History — Key Events & Timeline

Eritrea's history is a complex and multifaceted narrative that spans thousands of years, from ancient kingdoms to colonial rule and eventual independence.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Eritrea begins with the ancient **Kingdom of D'mt**, which flourished in the region from around 980 to 400 BCE. This kingdom was followed by the **Kingdom of Aksum**, which played a significant role in the development of the region's trade and culture. The pre-colonial era in Eritrea was marked by the presence of various kingdoms and sultanates, including the **Medri Bahri** kingdom, which existed from the 13th to the 19th century. In the late 19th century, Eritrea became an Italian colony, marking the beginning of the colonial period. The country gained independence in 1993, after a long and bloody struggle against Ethiopian rule.

The colonial period in Eritrea was marked by significant economic development, including the construction of roads, railways, and ports. However, the Italian colonial authorities also implemented policies that favored the Italian population over the local Eritrean population, leading to significant social and economic disparities. During World War II, Eritrea was occupied by British forces, which paved the way for the country's eventual independence. The post-independence period in Eritrea has been marked by significant challenges, including a border conflict with Ethiopia and a struggling economy.

In recent years, Eritrea has made significant progress in terms of economic development, including the expansion of the mining sector and the development of the country's infrastructure. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of democratic institutions and a poor human rights record. Despite these challenges, Eritrea remains a country with a rich history and culture, and a strong sense of national identity.

The modern era in Eritrea has been marked by a significant increase in international engagement, including the establishment of diplomatic relations with a number of countries. The country has also made significant progress in terms of economic development, including the expansion of the agricultural sector and the development of the country's tourism industry. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of democratic institutions and a poor human rights record.

[SECTION] Founding & Formation [/SECTION]
Eritrea became the entity it is today through a long and complex process of colonization, resistance, and independence. The country's founding is closely tied to the **Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF)**, which played a significant role in the independence movement. The EPLF was established in the 1970s, and became the main force behind the independence movement. The organization was led by a number of key figures, including **Isaias Afwerki**, who would eventually become the country's first president.

The formation of Eritrea as a modern nation-state was marked by a number of key events, including the capture of the capital city of Asmara by the EPLF in 1991. This event marked a significant turning point in the independence struggle, and paved the way for the country's eventual independence. The independence referendum, which was held in 1993, was also a key moment in the country's founding, as it provided a clear mandate for independence. The referendum was widely seen as a significant step towards the creation of a new nation-state.

[SECTION] Colonial & Independence Period [/SECTION]
Eritrea's colonial history began in the late 19th century, when the country was colonized by Italy. The Italian colonial authorities implemented a number of policies that favored the Italian population over the local Eritrean population, leading to significant social and economic disparities. The colonial period was marked by significant economic development, including the construction of roads, railways, and ports. However, the Italian colonial authorities also implemented policies that suppressed Eritrean culture and identity, leading to significant resentment among the local population.

The independence movement in Eritrea began in the 1960s, with the establishment of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). The ELF was a nationalist organization that sought to end Ethiopian rule and establish an independent Eritrean state. The organization was led by a number of key figures, including **Hamid Idris Awate**, who is widely regarded as one of the founders of the Eritrean independence movement. The EPLF, which was established in the 1970s, eventually became the main force behind the independence movement, and played a significant role in the country's struggle for independence.

The first leaders of independent Eritrea were closely tied to the EPLF, and included **Isaias Afwerki**, who became the country's first president. Afwerki played a significant role in the country's early development, and oversaw the establishment of a number of key institutions, including the national assembly and the judiciary. However, the country's early development was also marked by significant challenges, including a border conflict with Ethiopia and a struggling economy.
