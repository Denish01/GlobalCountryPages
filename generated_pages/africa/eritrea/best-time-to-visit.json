The wet season, which occurs from May to September, is marked by high temperatures and heavy rainfall, making travel more challenging. The country's **climate zones** vary from the hot and dry coastal regions to the cooler and more temperate highlands, where the capital city Asmara is located. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's historic sites, beaches, and national parks.\n\nThe dry season is also the best time to explore Eritrea's **cultural heritage**, including its historic cities, museums, and festivals. The cooler weather makes it ideal for walking tours, hiking, and other outdoor activities.
