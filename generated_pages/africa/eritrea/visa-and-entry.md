# Eritrea Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Eritrea before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Eritrea has a moderate visa policy, with a limited number of countries having visa-free access. Citizens of only a few countries, such as Sudan and Kenya, can enter Eritrea without a visa. The majority of nationalities require a visa to enter the country, which can be obtained through the Eritrean embassy or consulate in their home country or, in some cases, upon arrival at the airport. The Eritrean government has been working to improve its visa policy and simplify the process for tourists and business travelers.

The visa policy in Eritrea is designed to balance the need to control the flow of people into the country with the desire to promote tourism and economic development. The government has introduced various types of visas, including tourist, business, and student visas, to cater to different types of travelers. However, the process of obtaining a visa can be complex and time-consuming, and requirements may vary depending on the individual's nationality and purpose of visit.
