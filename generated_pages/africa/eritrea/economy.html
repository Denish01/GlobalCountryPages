        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Eritrea has a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $390. The country's economic development has been hindered by various factors, including a long-standing border conflict with Ethiopia, limited access to international markets, and a lack of foreign investment. Eritrea's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with the majority of the population engaged in subsistence farming. The country's economy has been growing slowly, with a GDP growth rate of around 2-3% per annum. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events.</p>
        <p>The Eritrean government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting economic development, including the creation of a free trade zone and the establishment of a national development plan. However, the country's economic progress has been hindered by a lack of infrastructure, including limited access to electricity, water, and transportation networks. The government has also faced criticism for its human rights record and its restrictive economic policies, which have limited the growth of the private sector.</p>
        <p>Eritrea's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from diaspora communities, with an estimated $400-500 million in remittances flowing into the country each year. The government has implemented various measures to encourage remittances, including the creation of a national remittance system and the provision of incentives for diaspora communities to invest in the country.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
        <p>Eritrea's economic outlook is uncertain, with the country facing significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to international markets, and a restrictive business environment. However, the country has significant potential for growth, particularly in the mining and services sectors. The government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting economic development, including the creation of a free trade zone and the establishment of a national development plan.</p>
        <p>The country's economic growth is expected to be driven by the mining sector, with significant investments in copper, gold, and zinc mining. The services sector is also expected to grow, with the government investing in the development of the tourism and logistics sectors. However, the country's economic progress will depend on its ability to address the significant challenges it faces, including the development of infrastructure, the promotion of private sector growth, and the improvement of the business environment. [CALLOUT] It is essential for investors and businesses to carefully consider these factors when evaluating opportunities in Eritrea.</p>
