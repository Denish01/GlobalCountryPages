The cuisine is characterized by the use of **injera**, a sourdough flatbread made from **teff** flour, which is used to scoop up various stews and salads. Eritrean cuisine has been influenced by its neighbors, including Ethiopia and Sudan, as well as by Italian and Arabic cultures. Regional variations exist, with the coastal region of Eritrea having a more Mediterranean-influenced cuisine, while the highlands have a more traditional, Ethiopian-influenced cuisine.\n\nThe use of spices and chilies is common in Eritrean cooking, with **berbere**, a spicy chili powder, being a staple ingredient. **Niter kibbeh**, a type of clarified butter, is also widely used to add flavor to dishes. Eritrean cuisine is often served family-style, with a variety of dishes placed in the center of the table for everyone to share. Mealtimes are social occasions, and food plays an important role in Eritrean culture and hospitality.\n\nEritrean cuisine is also known for its street food and snacks, which are widely available in markets and from street vendors. Popular snacks include **sambusas**, fried or baked pastries filled with spiced potatoes or lentils, and **ful medames**, a dish made from fava beans, garlic, and lemon juice. Eritrean cuisine is a reflection of the country's rich cultural heritage and its strategic location at the crossroads of Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Zigni | Stew | Spicy stew made with meat, usually beef or lamb, and served with injera | Traditional restaurants in Asmara |\n| Injera | Flatbread | Sourdough flatbread made from teff flour, used to scoop up stews and salads | Markets and restaurants throughout Eritrea |\n| Tibs | Stir-fry | Stir-fry made with sautéed meat, usually beef or lamb, and served with injera | Street food stalls and restaurants |\n| Ful Medames | Stew | Dish made from fava beans, garlic, and lemon juice, served with injera | Street food stalls and markets |\n| Sambusa | Snack | Fried or baked pastry filled with spiced potatoes or lentils | Street food stalls and markets |\n| Alicha | Stew | Mild stew made with meat, usually beef or lamb, and served with injera | Traditional restaurants in Asmara |\n| Misir Wot | Stew | Red lentil stew made with onions, garlic, and spices, served with injera | Traditional restaurants in Asmara |\n| Hmbasha | Bread | Sweet bread made with honey and spices, often served as a dessert | Bakeries and cafes |\n| Shiro | Stew | Stew made with chickpeas, onions, and spices, served with injera | Traditional restaurants in Asmara |\n| Doro Tibs | Stir-fry | Stir-fry made with sautéed chicken, onions, and spices, served with injera | Street food stalls and restaurants |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- Sambusas (fried or baked pastries filled with spiced potatoes or lentils): $1-$2 USD\n- Ful medames (dish made from fava beans, garlic, and lemon juice): $2-$3 USD\n- Injera with stews or salads: $3-$5 USD\n- Tibs (stir-fry made with sautéed meat, usually beef or lamb): $5-$7 USD\n- Hmbasha (sweet bread made with honey and spices): $1-$2 USD\n- Shiro (stew made with chickpeas, onions, and spices): $3-$5 USD\n- Doro tibs (stir-fry made with sautéed chicken, onions, and spices): $5-$7 USD\n- Fresh fruit (such as bananas, oranges, or mangoes): $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Mies** (traditional Eritrean beer): $2-$3 USD\n- **Sukkar** (traditional Eritrean coffee): $1-$2 USD\n- **Fresh juice** (such as orange, mango, or pineapple): $2-$3 USD\n- **Bottled water**: $1-$2 USD\n- **Soft drinks** (such as Coca-Cola or Fanta): $2-$3 USD\n- **Tea** (such as black tea or herbal tea): $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- It is customary to eat with your right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean\n- It is polite to wait for the host to invite you to start eating\n- It is customary to finish a meal completely, as leaving food on the plate can be seen as a sign of disrespect\n- Tipping is not expected, but 5-10% of the total bill is customary\n- Reservations are not usually necessary, but it is a good idea to call ahead to confirm\n- Dress codes are generally casual, but it is a good idea to dress modestly when eating in traditional restaurants\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional restaurants** in Asmara, such as the **Asmara Restaurant** or the **Eritrean Restaurant**\n- **Street food stalls** in markets and throughout cities\n- **Food courts** in shopping centers and markets\n- **Cafes** and **bakeries**, such as the **Asmara Cafe** or the **Hmbasha Bakery**\n- **Markets**, such as the **Asmara Market** or the **Keren Market**\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Asmara Market**: a large market in the center of Asmara, offering a wide variety of food, including fresh produce, meat, and spices\n- **Keren Market**: a market in the city of Keren, offering a wide variety of food, including traditional Eritrean dishes and snacks\n- **Massawa Fish Market**: a market in the port city of Massawa, offering a wide variety of fresh seafood\n- **Asmara Food Festival**: an annual festival celebrating Eritrean cuisine and culture\n- **Eritrean Cooking Class**: a cooking class where you can learn to make traditional Eritrean dishes, such as **Zigni** and **Injera**",
