        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Eritrea has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with few paved roads and limited public transportation options. The country has a number of domestic airports, including the Asmara International Airport, which provides connections to major cities in Africa and the Middle East. There are also bus services that connect major cities, although these can be slow and unreliable. The best way to get around Eritrea is by car, although driving conditions can be challenging, particularly on rural roads. It is also possible to hire taxis or rent cars, although these can be expensive.</p>
        <p>The government has invested in improving the transportation network, including the construction of new roads and the upgrading of existing ones. The country has also introduced a number of initiatives to promote sustainable transportation, including the use of bicycles and electric vehicles. Despite these efforts, getting around Eritrea can still be challenging, particularly for tourists and business travelers. It is recommended to plan ahead, research transportation options, and consider hiring a local guide or driver to navigate the country's roads and transportation systems.</p>
