# The Truth About Eritrea - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Eritrea is a **sovereign state** located in the Horn of Africa, with a rich and complex history. The country's strategic location on the Red Sea has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange for centuries. Eritrea was an Italian **colony** from 1890 to 1941, and after World War II, it was administered by the British. In 1952, Eritrea became a **federated state** within Ethiopia, but this arrangement was short-lived. In 1962, Ethiopia annexed Eritrea, leading to a long and bloody **independence struggle**. Eritrea finally gained independence on May 24, 1993, after a 30-year **war of independence**.

The country's history has been marked by periods of conflict and occupation, including the **Italian colonization** period, which had a significant impact on Eritrea's language, culture, and architecture. The **British administration** period, which followed the Italian colonization, also left its mark on the country. The **federation with Ethiopia**, which was established in 1952, was an attempt to create a more stable and cooperative relationship between the two countries. However, this arrangement ultimately failed, leading to the **independence struggle**.

Eritrea's **independence struggle** was a long and complex process, involving multiple factions and interest groups. The country's **independence movement** was led by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which was a **marxist-leninist** organization. The EPLF played a key role in the country's **independence struggle**, and its leader, Isaias Afwerki, became the country's first **president** after independence. Eritrea's **post-independence period** has been marked by significant challenges, including a **border conflict** with Ethiopia and a **UN sanctions** regime.

Eritrea's **independence** was recognized by the international community in 1993, and the country has since become a member of various international organizations, including the **United Nations** and the **African Union**. The country has also established diplomatic relations with numerous countries around the world, including the **United States**, **China**, and **European Union** member states. Eritrea's **foreign policy** has been focused on maintaining good relations with its neighbors and promoting regional stability.
