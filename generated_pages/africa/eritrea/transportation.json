  "content": "To get around in Eritrea, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and rental cars, although the transportation infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped and options may be limited. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Asmara International Airport (ASM)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nEritrea has one main international airport, Asmara International Airport (ASM), which is located about 5 kilometers from the capital city of Asmara. The airport receives flights from major hubs in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, including Cairo, Dubai, and Nairobi. Direct flights to Asmara are available from a few cities, including Cairo, Dubai, and Jeddah, but most travelers will need to connect through one of these hubs to reach Eritrea. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings open to travelers from Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti, although these routes may be subject to closures or restrictions due to security concerns.\n\nTravelers can enter Eritrea by land through the border crossings at Tessenei (from Sudan), Barentu (from Ethiopia), or Assab (from Djibouti). However, these routes can be challenging due to poor road conditions and security concerns, and it is recommended to check the current situation before attempting to cross the border by land. Additionally, all travelers entering Eritrea will need to obtain a visa, which can be arranged in advance through the Eritrean embassy or consulate in their home country, or in some cases, upon arrival at Asmara International Airport.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nEritrea has a limited domestic air network, with flights available between Asmara and a few other major cities, including Massawa and Assab. The main domestic airline is Eritrean Airlines, which operates a small fleet of planes and offers flights on a limited schedule. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, as availability can be limited and flights may be subject to cancellation or delay due to weather or other factors. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200 USD, depending on the route and class of service.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nEritrea does not have a functioning rail network, and there are no train services available for passengers. The country's rail infrastructure was largely destroyed during the war for independence, and although there have been efforts to rebuild the rail network, progress has been slow. As a result, travelers will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to get around the country.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus services are available in Eritrea, with companies such as Asmara Bus Company and Massawa Bus Company operating routes between major cities. The quality of bus services can vary, with some buses being relatively modern and comfortable, while others may be older and more basic. Fares are generally affordable, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 USD, depending on the route and class of service. However, bus travel can be slow due to poor road conditions, and schedules may be subject to change or cancellation due to weather or other factors.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Asmara, Massawa | $0.50-$1.00 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Taxi | Asmara, Massawa, Assab | $5-$10 | Metered fares, but may not always be used |\n| Ride-Hailing | Asmara | $5-$10 | Local alternatives to Uber, such as **Hilak** |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Asmara, Massawa | $2-$5 | Limited availability, but can be a convenient option for short trips |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Eritrea, you will need to obtain a local driver's license, as international licenses are not recognized.\n- Road conditions in Eritrea are generally poor, with many roads being unpaved or in disrepair.\n- Fuel costs can be high, with prices ranging from $1 to $2 USD per liter, depending on the location and availability of fuel.\n- Car rental companies are available in Asmara and other major cities, but options may be limited, and prices can be high.\n- Hazards on the road can include poor road conditions, lack of street lighting, and **livestock** or other animals on the road.\n- It is recommended to drive during the day, as night driving can be particularly hazardous due to the lack of street lighting and other factors.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting travelers, such as overpriced taxi fares or fake tour operators.\n- Payment methods can be limited, with many businesses only accepting cash, so it is recommended to have a sufficient supply of local currency, the **Eritrean nakfa**.\n- Download local apps, such as **Hilak**, to help navigate the city and find transportation options.\n- Be respectful of local **cultural norms**, such as dressing modestly and removing your shoes when entering mosques or other religious sites.\n- Stay informed about local **security conditions**, as the situation can change rapidly, and it is recommended to stay up to date with the latest travel advisories and news.\n- Consider hiring a reputable **tour operator** or guide to help navigate the country and ensure a safe and enjoyable trip.\n- Be prepared for **delays** and **cancellations**, as transportation services can be unreliable, and it is recommended to have a flexible itinerary and plan for contingencies.",
