The government has been known to block access to certain websites and restrict online freedom, making it essential for tourists and remote workers to be aware of these limitations before traveling to the country. Despite these challenges, there are some efforts to improve internet connectivity in Eritrea, with the government investing in new infrastructure and **telecommunication** projects.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Eritrea, tourists can visit one of the main carriers, such as **EriTel** or **Sudani**, and purchase a prepaid SIM card.
