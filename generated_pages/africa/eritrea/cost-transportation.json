The majority of the population relies on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around, which can be affordable but often crowded. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with the capital city Asmara having a slightly more developed system than other parts of the country. In rural areas, transportation options are often limited, and people may have to rely on **walking** or **cycling** as their primary mode of transportation.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Eritrea include **buses**, **minibuses**, and **taxis**, which are available in most cities and towns. However, the frequency and reliability of these services can be inconsistent, and passengers may have to wait for long periods of time for a bus or taxi to arrive. Additionally, the roads in Eritrea can be in poor condition, especially during the rainy season, which can make travel times longer and more unpredictable.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, unreliable schedules |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Available on major routes, often crowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-$3 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Limited availability, may not always use meter |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited options, not widely available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | Private cars or taxis available, prices negotiable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80-$1.20 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70-$1.10 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, prices may vary depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $0.50-$1.00 | Limited parking options, prices may vary |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, no toll roads in Eritrea |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited schedules, may not always be available |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Limited routes, prices may vary depending on airline |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which can be a more affordable option than taking a private taxi.\n- When taking a taxi, it's a good idea to **negotiate the fare** before you start your journey, as not all taxis have meters.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or when using public transportation.\n- Consider using a **private car** or **rental car** for longer trips or for more convenience, but be aware that driving in Eritrea can be challenging due to poor road conditions.\n- Use **local currency** (ERN) whenever possible, as not all businesses may accept foreign currency.\n- Be prepared for **delays** and **cancellations** when using public transportation, and plan your journey accordingly.",
