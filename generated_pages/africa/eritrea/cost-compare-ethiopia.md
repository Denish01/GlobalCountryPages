[SECTION] Overview: Eritrea vs Ethiopia [/SECTION]
Eritrea and Ethiopia are two neighboring countries in the Horn of Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Eritrea has a relatively small economy, with a GDP per capita of around 1,400 USD, while Ethiopia has a larger economy, with a GDP per capita of around 2,200 USD. Despite Ethiopia's stronger economy, Eritrea tends to be cheaper in terms of overall cost of living, with a difference of around 15-20% in favor of Eritrea. This is largely due to the fact that Eritrea has a more limited economy, with fewer imported goods and services, which keeps prices lower.

The economic context of both countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Eritrea has a more isolated economy, with limited trade and investment, which can make it harder for foreigners to find employment and access certain goods and services. Ethiopia, on the other hand, has a more open economy, with a growing manufacturing sector and a large number of foreign investors. This has led to a more dynamic and diverse economy, with a wider range of goods and services available, but also higher prices. Overall, Eritrea is generally cheaper than Ethiopia, but the difference is not dramatic, and both countries offer a unique set of advantages and disadvantages for expats and travelers.
