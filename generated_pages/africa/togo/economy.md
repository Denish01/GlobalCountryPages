[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Togo's economy is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $843. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average annual rate of 5%. However, Togo still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, a reliance on agriculture, and a vulnerability to external shocks. The country is working to diversify its economy and increase its competitiveness, with a focus on developing the manufacturing and services sectors. Togo's economy is also heavily influenced by its geography, with the country's location on the coast of West Africa making it an important transit point for trade in the region.

The Togolese government has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting economic development, including investments in infrastructure and efforts to improve the business climate. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of access to credit and a limited pool of skilled workers. Despite these challenges, Togo has made significant progress in recent years, and the country is well-positioned to continue growing and developing in the coming years. The government's economic strategy is focused on promoting private sector growth, increasing investment, and improving the business climate, with the goal of achieving sustainable and inclusive economic development.

Togo's economic trajectory is also influenced by its membership in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). These regional organizations provide a framework for economic cooperation and integration, and have helped to promote trade and investment in the region. However, Togo's economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global commodity prices and fluctuations in the value of the West African CFA franc, the country's currency.
