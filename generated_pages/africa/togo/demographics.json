  "content": "The population of Togo is approximately 8.8 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, and a growing urban population.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 8.8 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.7%\nMedian Age: 19.4 years\nUrban Population: 42.8%\nPopulation Density: 143 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 64.8 years\nFertility Rate: 4.2 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nTogo has a relatively small population compared to other countries in West Africa, but it is growing rapidly, with a population growth rate of 2.7% per year. The country's population is expected to continue growing, driven by a high total fertility rate of 4.2 children per woman. The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 42.8% of the population living in urban areas. This trend is driven by migration from rural areas to cities such as Lome, the capital, in search of better economic opportunities. Togo's population is also characterized by a high percentage of young people, with over 60% of the population under the age of 25.\n\nThe country's population size and growth trends have significant implications for its economy, education system, and healthcare services. The government of Togo faces challenges in providing adequate services to its growing population, particularly in areas such as education and healthcare. However, the country's growing population also presents opportunities for economic growth and development, particularly in the urban areas. The government has implemented policies aimed at promoting economic development and improving living standards, such as investing in infrastructure and promoting private sector growth.\n\nTogo's population is also affected by migration patterns, with many Togolese citizens migrating to other countries in search of better economic opportunities. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with many Togolese people living and working in countries such as Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria. However, the country also receives migrants from other countries in the region, particularly from neighboring Ghana and Benin.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ewe | 21% | South | Largest ethnic group in the south |\n| Kabye | 12% | North | Predominant in the northern region |\n| Tem | 9% | Central | Found in the central region |\n| Gourma | 5% | East | Also found in neighboring countries |\n| Mina | 4% | South | Concentrated in the coastal region |\n| Akebou | 3% | South | Smaller ethnic group in the south |\n| Ana | 2% | North | Found in the northern region |\n| Lamba | 1% | Central | Smaller ethnic group in the central region |\n[/TABLE]\nTogo is a culturally diverse country, with over 40 ethnic groups. The Ewe people are the largest ethnic group, making up approximately 21% of the population, and are found primarily in the south. The Kabye people are the second largest ethnic group, making up around 12% of the population, and are predominantly found in the northern region. The country's ethnic diversity is a result of its strategic location, with many different ethnic groups having migrated to the area over the centuries. Despite this diversity, Togo has a relatively stable ethnic relations environment, with most ethnic groups coexisting peacefully. However, there are some tensions between different ethnic groups, particularly between the Ewe and Kabye people, which have historically been the dominant groups in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **French** is the official language of Togo and is widely spoken, particularly in urban areas.\n- Ewe and Kabye are the two most widely spoken local languages, with many Togolese people speaking one or both of these languages.\n- The Mina language is also widely spoken, particularly in the coastal region.\n- Other local languages, such as Tem and Gourma, are also spoken in different regions of the country.\n- **English** is becoming increasingly popular as a second language, particularly among the educated population.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Christianity | 29% | Predominantly Catholic and Protestant |\n| Islam | 20% | Found primarily in the north |\n| Traditional African Religions | 51% | Many Togolese people practice traditional religions |\n| Other | 1% | Includes small numbers of Buddhists, Hindus, and others |\n[/TABLE]\nTogo is a religiously diverse country, with a mix of Christian, Muslim, and traditional African religions. The majority of the population, around 51%, practices traditional African religions, while around 29% of the population is Christian and 20% is Muslim. The country has a relatively high level of religious freedom, with most people able to practice their faith freely. However, there are some tensions between different religious groups, particularly between Christians and Muslims. The government of Togo has implemented policies aimed at promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding, and the country has a number of organizations that work to promote religious tolerance and coexistence.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 42% | High dependence ratio, pressure on education system |\n| 15-24 | 22% | Large youth population, potential for economic growth |\n| 25-54 | 30% | Working-age population, driving economic growth |\n| 55-64 | 4% | Smaller population of older workers, potential for knowledge transfer |\n| 65+ | 2% | Small elderly population, relatively low burden on social services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- The urban population is growing rapidly, with many people migrating from rural areas to cities such as Lome and Sokode.\n- Lome is the largest city, with a population of over 800,000 people, and is the economic and cultural hub of the country.\n- Sokode is the second largest city, with a population of around 100,000 people, and is an important center for trade and commerce.\n- Other major cities include Kara, Atakpame, and Dapaong, which are all growing rapidly.\n- The urban-rural split is becoming increasingly pronounced, with many rural areas experiencing significant out-migration of young people to urban areas.",
