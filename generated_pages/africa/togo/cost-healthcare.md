[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Togo's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, with lower costs for consultations, treatments, and medications. However, public healthcare facilities are often overcrowded and under-equipped, with limited resources and outdated medical equipment. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer better quality and more comprehensive care, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and expats often opt for private healthcare services. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare in Togo can be high, especially for serious or chronic conditions.

The healthcare system in Togo is also characterized by a lack of specialized medical care, particularly in rural areas. Many medical specialties are only available in the capital city, Lome, or in larger urban centers. This can make it difficult for people living in rural areas to access specialized medical care, and may require them to travel long distances to receive treatment. Additionally, the healthcare system in Togo is often underfunded, with limited resources and outdated medical equipment. This can make it challenging for healthcare providers to deliver high-quality care, particularly in public healthcare facilities.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, are often available over-the-counter at pharmacies and markets, with prices ranging from $5-$10 per prescription
- Prescription medications, such as those for chronic conditions, often require a doctor's prescription and can be more expensive, with prices ranging from $10-$50 per month
- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but can be limited in rural areas, where patients may need to travel long distances to access pharmacy services
- Over-the-counter medications are often available at markets and pharmacies, but may not always be genuine or effective, and patients should exercise caution when purchasing medications from unlicensed vendors
- Prescription rules are often lax, and patients may be able to purchase prescription medications without a doctor's prescription, but this can pose serious health risks and patients should always follow the advice of a qualified healthcare professional
- Medication prices can vary widely depending on the pharmacy and location, with prices often higher in rural areas due to transportation costs and limited competition

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, patients should call the local emergency number, 117, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic. Ambulance services are often limited, and patients may need to rely on private transportation or taxis to get to the hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners and expats are often private clinics, which offer more comprehensive and better-equipped emergency services. Patients should always carry some form of identification and medical insurance information with them, in case of an emergency. It is also recommended that patients research and identify the nearest and best-equipped hospital or clinic before a medical emergency arises, to ensure that they can receive prompt and effective treatment.

In addition to emergency services, patients should also be aware of the availability of specialized medical care, such as cardiac or trauma care, and the location of the nearest hospital or clinic that offers these services. Patients should also research and understand the local healthcare system, including the role of public and private healthcare providers, and the availability of medical services and equipment. This can help patients navigate the healthcare system more effectively and receive the best possible care in the event of a medical emergency. [CALLOUT] It is essential to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital or clinic, having a means of transportation, and carrying medical insurance information and identification.
