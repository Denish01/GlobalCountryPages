[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Togo is not as developed as in other parts of the world, with an average internet speed of 5 Mbps download. The quality of the internet connection can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas like Lome generally having faster and more reliable connections than rural areas. The **urban vs rural divide** is significant, with many rural areas having limited or no access to the internet. The reliability of the internet connection can also be a problem, with frequent outages and slow speeds, especially during peak hours.

Despite these challenges, the internet is still an essential part of life in Togo, with many people relying on it for communication, education, and business. The government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with plans to expand fiber optic networks and increase access to the internet in rural areas. However, more needs to be done to address the **digital divide** and ensure that everyone in Togo has access to fast and reliable internet.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Togo is relatively easy, with many mobile providers offering **tourist SIM cards** that can be purchased at the airport or at mobile phone shops in Lome. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, and the cost is around 5 USD. The main carriers in Togo are Togocel, Moov, and Teleso, and they all offer a range of data plans and packages. It is recommended to buy a SIM card from a reputable provider and to check the coverage and data speeds before purchasing.
