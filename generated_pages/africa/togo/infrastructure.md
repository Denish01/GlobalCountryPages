# Togo Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Togo's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks, but still facing challenges in terms of access to basic services, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 43.4% of population
Internet Penetration: 12.3%
Road Network: 11,000 km, with 2,300 km paved
Rail Network: 568 km
Major Airports: 2
Major Ports: 1
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Togo's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's transportation network, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of energy production and distribution, with frequent power outages and a lack of access to electricity in rural areas. The government has launched several initiatives to improve the infrastructure, including the creation of a national infrastructure plan, which aims to increase access to basic services and promote economic growth.

The infrastructure gap between urban and rural areas is a major concern, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address this gap, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones, as well as the installation of new water and sanitation systems. However, more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the country's infrastructure sector.

Togo's infrastructure sector has also been affected by the country's limited financial resources, which have made it difficult to invest in new infrastructure projects. However, the government has been working to attract foreign investment and to secure funding from international organizations to support its infrastructure development plans. This has included the launch of several public-private partnerships, which have helped to attract new investment and to improve the quality of the country's infrastructure.
