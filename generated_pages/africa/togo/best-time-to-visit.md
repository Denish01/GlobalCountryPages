[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Togo: November to March. Peak season: December to February. Budget season: April to June. Avoid: July to September and the harmattan season in December, due to heavy rainfall and dusty winds. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Togo has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which lasts from November to March, is characterized by low humidity and pleasant temperatures, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from April to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making travel more challenging. The country can be divided into two climate zones: the coastal region, which has a more moderate climate, and the interior, which is hotter and more humid. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as the wet season can make roads impassable, and the dry season can be very dusty.

The harmattan season, which occurs in December, is a period of dry and dusty winds that can make travel uncomfortable. The wet season, on the other hand, can be a good time to see the country's waterfalls and lakes in full flow. However, the heavy rainfall can make some areas inaccessible, and the high temperatures can be oppressive. Overall, the dry season is the best time to visit Togo, as it offers pleasant weather and ideal conditions for exploring the country's diverse landscapes and cultural attractions.

The dry season is also the best time to visit the country's national parks and wildlife reserves, as the dry conditions make it easier to spot animals. The wet season, on the other hand, is a good time to see the country's flora in full bloom, as the heavy rainfall brings new life to the landscape. However, the wet season can also be a challenging time to travel, as the heavy rainfall can make roads impassable, and the high temperatures can be oppressive.
