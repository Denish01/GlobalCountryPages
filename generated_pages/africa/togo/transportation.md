The airport receives flights from major airlines, including Air France, Turkish Airlines, and Royal Air Maroc, with direct connections to European and African hubs such as Paris, Istanbul, and Casablanca. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from neighboring countries Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Benin. The most popular border crossing is the one from Ghana, which is a major transit point for goods and people. 

For those entering Togo by land, there are several bus companies that operate from neighboring countries, including Ghana and Benin.
