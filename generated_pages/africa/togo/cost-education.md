[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Togo's education system is primarily based on the French model, with French being the language of instruction. The system is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary education, with six years of compulsory education. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking adequate resources and infrastructure. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significant cost. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of Lome, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British GCSEs.

The quality of education in Togo is a significant concern, with many schools facing challenges such as overcrowding, inadequate teacher training, and limited resources. However, there are also some excellent schools, particularly in the private sector, that offer a high-quality education and excellent facilities. Expats and international students often opt for these private schools, which can provide a more familiar and rigorous academic environment. Additionally, some schools in Togo are now offering bilingual programs, which can be an attractive option for families who want their children to learn both French and English.
