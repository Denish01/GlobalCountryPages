[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Togo's business environment is characterized by a complex bureaucracy and a relatively high level of corruption. The government has been making efforts to improve the business climate, including the creation of a one-stop shop for business registration and the implementation of various reforms to simplify administrative procedures. However, the country still ranks low in terms of ease of doing business, according to the World Bank. The government's attitude towards foreign investment is generally positive, with a range of incentives offered to attract foreign investors. Despite this, the level of bureaucracy and corruption can make it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently.

The business environment in Togo is also influenced by the country's geographical location, with its port city of Lome serving as a key hub for trade in the region. The country's strategic location and access to the sea make it an attractive location for businesses looking to export goods to other countries in West Africa. However, the country's infrastructure, including its roads and telecommunications networks, is still underdeveloped, which can make it difficult to transport goods and communicate with suppliers and customers.

Overall, while Togo's business environment presents some challenges, the country also offers a range of opportunities for businesses, particularly in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. With the right support and investment, businesses can thrive in Togo and take advantage of the country's strategic location and growing economy.
