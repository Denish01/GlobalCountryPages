[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Togo has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **taxis**, **minibuses**, and **motorbikes** to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with crowded and unreliable services. However, the country is investing in infrastructure development, including road construction and public transportation upgrades. In the capital city of Lome, the main transportation modes include taxis, minibuses, and city buses, while in rural areas, people often rely on motorcycles and bicycles.

The transportation system in Togo is largely informal, with many private operators providing services. This can make it challenging for visitors to navigate, especially outside of major cities. However, with some planning and research, it is possible to get around the country relatively easily. Many locals also rely on **walking** and **cycling** as a mode of transportation, especially for short distances.
