[SECTION] How Togo Is Divided [/SECTION]
Togo is a sovereign country located in West Africa, bordered by Ghana to the west, Burkina Faso to the north, and Benin to the east. The country is divided into five regions, each with its own administrative capital and unique characteristics. The regions are further divided into prefectures, which are then subdivided into cantons and villages. This administrative structure allows for a decentralized approach to governance, with each region having a degree of autonomy to manage its own affairs.

The five regions of Togo are Centrale, Kara, Maritime, Plateaux, and Savanes. Each region has its own distinct cultural, economic, and geographical features, shaped by the country's history, climate, and natural resources. The regional capitals serve as economic and cultural hubs, providing access to basic services, infrastructure, and amenities for the local population.
