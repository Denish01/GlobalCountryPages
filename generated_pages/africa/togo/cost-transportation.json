The quality of public transit is generally poor, with crowded and unreliable services. However, the country is investing in infrastructure development, including road construction and public transportation upgrades. In the capital city of Lome, the main transportation modes include taxis, minibuses, and city buses, while in rural areas, people often rely on motorcycles and bicycles.\n\nThe transportation system in Togo is largely informal, with many private operators providing services. This can make it challenging for visitors to navigate, especially outside of major cities. However, with some planning and research, it is possible to get around the country relatively easily. Many locals also rely on **walking** and **cycling** as a mode of transportation, especially for short distances.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, crowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | Routes vary, often overcrowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-$2 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Negotiation common |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$3 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Alfato, local taxi services |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, fixed rate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, unlimited mileage |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, mostly urban |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, variable quality |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Limited routes, mostly from Lome |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis** for shorter distances.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Alfato to book taxis or cars, especially in larger cities.\n- Always **negotiate taxi fares** before starting your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- Be aware of **traffic conditions**, especially in urban areas, and plan your route accordingly.\n- Consider **renting a car** for longer distances or intercity travel, as public transportation options may be limited.\n- When using **public transportation**, be mindful of your belongings and avoid traveling at night, especially in rural areas.",
