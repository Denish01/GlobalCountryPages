  "content": "The education system in Togo is based on a **French-style** model, with a focus on primary, secondary, and tertiary education, and offers various opportunities for both local and international students to study in the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 77.9%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: French\nAcademic Calendar: October to July\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 5 universities in West Africa\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Togo is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **enseignement primaire**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, and is provided free of charge by the government. Secondary education, also known as **enseignement secondaire**, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle, which lasts for 4 years, and the second cycle, which lasts for 3 years. Tertiary education, also known as **enseignement supérieur**, is provided by universities and other higher education institutions, and offers a range of academic programs in fields such as **medicine**, **engineering**, and **business**. The quality of education in Togo is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on **mathematics**, **science**, and **language**. However, there are significant differences between public and private schools, with private schools generally offering higher quality education and better facilities.\n\nThe public education system in Togo faces several challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including the introduction of **free primary education** and the development of new **curricula**. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a range of academic programs and often have better facilities and more qualified teachers. However, they can be expensive, and are often out of reach for many families.\n\nThe education system in Togo is also influenced by the country's cultural and linguistic diversity. The official language of instruction is **French**, but many schools also offer instruction in **local languages**. This can create challenges for students who do not speak French as their first language, but it also provides opportunities for students to learn about their own culture and language.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
