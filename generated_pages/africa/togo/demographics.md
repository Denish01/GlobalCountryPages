[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Togo has a relatively small population compared to other countries in West Africa, but it is growing rapidly, with a population growth rate of 2.7% per year. The country's population is expected to continue growing, driven by a high total fertility rate of 4.2 children per woman. The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 42.8% of the population living in urban areas. This trend is driven by migration from rural areas to cities such as Lome, the capital, in search of better economic opportunities. Togo's population is also characterized by a high percentage of young people, with over 60% of the population under the age of 25.

The country's population size and growth trends have significant implications for its economy, education system, and healthcare services. The government of Togo faces challenges in providing adequate services to its growing population, particularly in areas such as education and healthcare. However, the country's growing population also presents opportunities for economic growth and development, particularly in the urban areas. The government has implemented policies aimed at promoting economic development and improving living standards, such as investing in infrastructure and promoting private sector growth.

Togo's population is also affected by migration patterns, with many Togolese citizens migrating to other countries in search of better economic opportunities. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with many Togolese people living and working in countries such as Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria. However, the country also receives migrants from other countries in the region, particularly from neighboring Ghana and Benin.
