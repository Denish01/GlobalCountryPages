  "content": "Togo's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks, but still facing challenges in terms of access to basic services, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 43.4% of population\nInternet Penetration: 12.3%\nRoad Network: 11,000 km, with 2,300 km paved\nRail Network: 568 km\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nTogo's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's transportation network, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of energy production and distribution, with frequent power outages and a lack of access to electricity in rural areas. The government has launched several initiatives to improve the infrastructure, including the creation of a national infrastructure plan, which aims to increase access to basic services and promote economic growth.\n\nThe infrastructure gap between urban and rural areas is a major concern, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address this gap, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones, as well as the installation of new water and sanitation systems. However, more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the country's infrastructure sector.\n\nTogo's infrastructure sector has also been affected by the country's limited financial resources, which have made it difficult to invest in new infrastructure projects. However, the government has been working to attract foreign investment and to secure funding from international organizations to support its infrastructure development plans. This has included the launch of several public-private partnerships, which have helped to attract new investment and to improve the quality of the country's infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 11,000 km | Moderate | 2,300 km paved, with many rural roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 568 km | Poor | Limited passenger and freight services, with many lines in disrepair |\n| Airports | 2 international, 5 domestic | Good | Lome-Tokoin Airport is the main international airport, with several smaller domestic airports |\n| Ports | 1 major | Moderate | The Port of Lome is the country's main port, with limited capacity and outdated facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Togo's power generation is primarily based on **thermal power**, with several small power plants located throughout the country\n- The country's energy sector is characterized by frequent **power outages**, particularly in rural areas, due to a lack of generating capacity and outdated distribution systems\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are being developed, with several small-scale projects already operational\n- The government has launched several initiatives to improve the country's energy sector, including the construction of new power plants and the rehabilitation of existing ones\n- Togo is also a member of the **West African Power Pool**, which aims to promote regional cooperation and integration in the energy sector\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is not always safe to drink, particularly in rural areas, where many communities lack access to modern water treatment systems\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with many households lacking access to modern sanitation facilities, particularly in rural areas\n- **Water access** is a major challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional sources such as wells and springs\n- The government has launched several initiatives to improve access to water and sanitation, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the rehabilitation of existing ones\n- **International organizations**, such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank, are providing support to Togo's water and sanitation sector, including funding for new infrastructure projects\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively good, with several mobile operators providing services throughout the country\n- **Fiber optic** networks are being developed, with several major cities already connected\n- **4G/5G** services are being rolled out, with several mobile operators already offering high-speed internet services\n- **Postal services** are limited, with many rural communities lacking access to modern postal facilities\n- The government has launched several initiatives to improve the country's telecommunications sector, including the construction of new fiber optic networks and the promotion of **e-government** services\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Lome-Tokoin Airport** expansion project, which aims to increase the airport's capacity and improve its facilities\n- The **Port of Lome** expansion project, which aims to increase the port's capacity and improve its facilities\n- The **Togo-Ghana power interconnection** project, which aims to promote regional cooperation and integration in the energy sector\n- The **West African Corridor** project, which aims to improve the region's transportation network and promote economic integration\n- The **Togo Water and Sanitation Project**, which aims to improve access to water and sanitation throughout the country, particularly in rural areas",
