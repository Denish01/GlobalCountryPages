The country shares borders with three neighboring countries: Ghana to the west, Burkina Faso to the north, and Benin to the east. The capital city, Lome, is located on the coast and serves as the country's main port and commercial center. Togo's strategic location allows for trade and cultural exchange with its neighboring countries, as well as with European and other African nations.\n\nThe country's borders are relatively straight, with the exception of a small eastern protrusion that borders Benin. The border with Ghana is the longest, stretching for approximately 877 kilometers. Togo's coastline is short, but it provides access to the Atlantic Ocean and facilitates trade and commerce. The country's location in the tropics means that it experiences a warm and humid climate year-round, with two main seasons: a dry season and a wet season.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nTogo's terrain is characterized by a variety of landscapes, including mountains, forests, and coastal plains. The country can be divided into four main regions: the coastal plains, the plateau region, the mountainous region, and the savanna region. The coastal plains are narrow and stretch along the Gulf of Guinea, with sandy beaches and mangrove swamps. The plateau region is located just inland from the coast and is characterized by rolling hills and valleys.\n\nThe mountainous region is located in the north and is home to the country's highest point, Mont Agou, which rises to an elevation of 986 meters. The mountains are covered in dense forests and are home to a variety of wildlife, including monkeys, antelopes, and birds. The savanna region is located in the north and is characterized by grasslands and scattered trees. The country's terrain is also home to several rivers, including the Mono River, which flows through the country and empties into the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nThe forests of Togo are an important part of the country's ecosystem, providing habitat for a variety of plants and animals. The forests are also an important source of timber and other forest products, which are used for both domestic consumption and export. However, the forests are under threat from deforestation and habitat destruction, which are major environmental concerns in Togo.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dry Season | December to March | 22-30°C | low | dry and sunny |\n| Hot Season | April to May | 25-35°C | low | hot and dry |\n| Wet Season | June to September | 20-28°C | high | rainy and humid |\n| Harmattan Season | October to November | 20-25°C | low | dry and cool |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: December to March.
