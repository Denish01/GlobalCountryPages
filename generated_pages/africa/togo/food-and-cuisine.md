The country's dishes are often simple, yet flavorful, and make use of locally available ingredients such as **yams**, **plantains**, and **cassava**. The cuisine varies by region, with the coastal areas favoring seafood and the interior regions relying on meat and vegetables. In Togo, mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to socialize and bond with family and friends, and meals are typically served in a communal setting.

The country's history as a German and then French colony has had a significant impact on its cuisine, with many dishes incorporating European ingredients and cooking techniques. For example, the popular dish **Riz Gras**, a flavorful rice dish with meat and vegetables, is a testament to the French influence on Togolese cuisine.
