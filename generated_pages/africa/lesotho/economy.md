[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Lesotho's economy is a lower-middle-income economy, with a mix of traditional and modern sectors. The country has a small but growing manufacturing sector, with a focus on textiles and apparel. The economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, with many Basotho people engaged in subsistence farming. Lesotho is also rich in natural resources, including water, diamonds, and coal. The country's economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, with a GDP growth rate of around 3-4% per annum. However, the economy is vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in the weather.

Lesotho's economic development is also hindered by its lack of diversification and its heavy reliance on a few key sectors. The country is also heavily dependent on remittances from Basotho workers in South Africa, which can be a volatile source of income. The government has been working to diversify the economy and improve the business environment, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting private sector growth. Lesotho has also been working to improve its infrastructure, including its roads, water supply, and energy systems.

Lesotho's economic classification as a lower-middle-income economy reflects its relatively low level of economic development. The country has made significant progress in recent years, but it still faces many challenges, including high levels of poverty and unemployment. The government has been working to address these challenges, with a focus on promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. However, the country's economic development is also dependent on external factors, including the state of the global economy and the policies of its neighbors.
