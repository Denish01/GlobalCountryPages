  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nLesotho, officially known as the Kingdom of Lesotho, is a **sovereign** country located in southern Africa. The area that is now Lesotho was originally inhabited by the **San** and **Khoikhoi** peoples, but it was later settled by the **Basotho** people, who arrived in the 16th century. In the early 19th century, the Basotho kingdom was unified under the leadership of **Moshoeshoe I**, who is considered the founder of the modern Basotho nation. Lesotho was a British **protectorate** from 1868 to 1966, when it gained its independence. The country became a **constitutional monarchy** with a parliamentary system of government.\n\nThe road to independence was long and complex, with Lesotho being a British protectorate for nearly a century. During this time, the country was known as **Basutoland**. The British government controlled the country's foreign affairs, while the Basotho people had a degree of autonomy in internal matters. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Basotho people began to demand greater autonomy and eventually independence from Britain. Lesotho gained its independence on October 4, 1966, with **Moshoeshoe II** as its first king.\n\nLesotho's early years of independence were marked by political instability and conflict with neighboring South Africa.
