The country has a small but growing manufacturing sector, with a focus on textiles and apparel. The economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, with many Basotho people engaged in subsistence farming. Lesotho is also rich in natural resources, including water, diamonds, and coal. The country's economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, with a GDP growth rate of around 3-4% per annum. However, the economy is vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in the weather.\n\nLesotho's economic development is also hindered by its lack of diversification and its heavy reliance on a few key sectors. The country is also heavily dependent on remittances from Basotho workers in South Africa, which can be a volatile source of income. The government has been working to diversify the economy and improve the business environment, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting private sector growth. Lesotho has also been working to improve its infrastructure, including its roads, water supply, and energy systems.\n\nLesotho's economic classification as a lower-middle-income economy reflects its relatively low level of economic development. The country has made significant progress in recent years, but it still faces many challenges, including high levels of poverty and unemployment. The government has been working to address these challenges, with a focus on promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. However, the country's economic development is also dependent on external factors, including the state of the global economy and the policies of its neighbors.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Subsistence farming, livestock, and crops such as maize, wheat, and sorghum |\n| Textiles | 15% of GDP | Manufacturing of apparel and textiles, mostly for export to the US and EU |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Mining of diamonds, coal, and other minerals, with significant potential for growth |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | Financial services, tourism, and other services, including telecommunications and transport |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | Production of food, beverages, and other manufactured goods, including textiles and apparel |\n| Construction | 5% of GDP | Building and construction, including infrastructure development and housing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Textiles and apparel, which are exported to the US and EU under preferential trade agreements\n- Diamonds and other minerals, which are exported to countries such as Belgium and India\n- Agricultural products, such as maize and wheat, which are exported to neighboring countries\n- Manufactured goods, such as food and beverages, which are exported to regional markets\n- Water, which is exported to South Africa under a long-term agreement\n**Top Imports:** \n- Machinery and equipment, which are imported from countries such as China and the US\n- Fuels and petroleum products, which are imported from South Africa and other countries\n- Food and beverages, which are imported from neighboring countries and other regions\n- Chemicals and pharmaceuticals, which are imported from countries such as India and the US\n- Vehicles and transport equipment, which are imported from countries such as Japan and the US\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- South Africa, which is Lesotho's largest trading partner and provides a significant market for its exports\n- US, which is a major market for Lesotho's textiles and apparel exports\n- EU, which provides a significant market for Lesotho's textiles and apparel exports under preferential trade agreements\n- China, which is a growing trading partner and provides a significant source of imports\n- India, which is also a growing trading partner and provides a significant market for Lesotho's diamond exports\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Lesotho has a relatively well-developed road network, with many paved roads and a growing number of highways\n- The country has a limited rail network, with only a few lines connecting it to South Africa\n- Lesotho has a growing energy sector, with a mix of hydro, solar, and wind power\n- The country has a relatively high level of internet and mobile penetration, with many Basotho people using mobile phones and accessing the internet\n- Lesotho has a small international airport, which provides connections to regional and international destinations\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nLesotho's economic outlook is positive, with the country expected to continue growing at a steady rate over the next few years.
