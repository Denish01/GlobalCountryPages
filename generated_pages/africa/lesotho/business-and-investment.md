[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Lesotho's business environment is characterized by a relatively small market size and limited infrastructure, which can pose challenges for foreign investors. The government has, however, implemented various reforms to improve the business climate, including simplifying the process of starting a business and reducing bureaucracy. The government's attitude toward foreign investment is generally positive, with a focus on attracting investment in key sectors such as textiles and manufacturing. However, corruption remains a significant issue, and investors may face difficulties in navigating the country's complex regulatory framework.

The level of bureaucracy in Lesotho is relatively high, with multiple agencies and departments involved in the business registration process. This can lead to delays and increased costs for investors. Despite these challenges, Lesotho offers a relatively low-cost business environment, with competitive labor costs and access to the South African market through the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).

Lesotho's economy is heavily dependent on South Africa, and the country's economic growth is closely tied to its larger neighbor. The government has implemented various initiatives to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on South Africa, including the development of the textile and manufacturing sectors.
