Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, with a deposit of 1-2 months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the Lesotho Land Act, which provides for fair rent, security of tenure, and protection against eviction. Compared to its regional neighbors, Lesotho's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to live and work in the region. However, the market can be competitive, particularly in the city center, where demand for housing is high.\n\nThe housing market in Lesotho is also influenced by the country's economy, which is largely driven by agriculture and textiles. The country's GDP per capita is relatively low, which can make it challenging for locals to afford housing, particularly in the city center. However, the government has implemented initiatives to increase access to affordable housing, including the development of new housing estates and the provision of subsidies for low-income households. For expats, the cost of living in Lesotho is relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to live and work in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$250 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | fully furnished, modern appliances |\n| 2 Bedroom | $400-$600 | $250-$450 | spacious, secure parking |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $400-$700 | large garden, scenic views |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, scenic views |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | traditional villages, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Maseru West: a popular neighborhood for expats, with modern amenities and a vibrant nightlife, rent range $200-$500 USD per month\n- Thetsane: a residential area with a mix of modern and traditional housing, rent range $150-$350 USD per month\n- Roma: a historic neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $100-$300 USD per month\n- Hillsview: a scenic neighborhood with stunning views of the city, rent range $250-$600 USD per month\n- Khubetsoana: a suburban area with a mix of residential and commercial properties, rent range $150-$400 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Lesotho [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and compare prices before signing a lease\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Inspect the property thoroughly before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms to get the best deal\n- Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit without a signed lease agreement\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, so clarify what is included in the rent before signing a lease",
