  "content": "The primary language spoken in Lesotho is **Sesotho**, also known as Sotho, which is the official language along with English.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Sesotho, English\nWidely Spoken: Other common languages include Zulu and Xhosa, spoken by neighboring communities\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Bantu\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Lesotho is dominated by **Sesotho**, which is spoken by the majority of the population. Sesotho is a Bantu language that is also spoken in parts of South Africa. There are several regional dialects of Sesotho, but the standard dialect is widely understood throughout the country. English is also widely spoken, particularly in urban areas and among the educated population. However, in rural areas, Sesotho is the primary language spoken. Minority languages, such as Zulu and Xhosa, are also spoken in Lesotho, particularly in areas near the South African border.\n\nSesotho is a tonal language, which means that the pitch and tone of words can change their meaning. The language has a complex grammar system, with many prefixes and suffixes that are used to indicate grammatical relationships. Despite the challenges of learning Sesotho, many visitors to Lesotho find that speaking a few words of the language can go a long way in terms of building relationships with the local people.\n\nEnglish is widely understood in Lesotho, particularly in tourist areas and among businesspeople. However, it is still a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in Sesotho, such as greetings and expressions of gratitude. This can help to show respect for the local culture and people, and can also make interactions more enjoyable and meaningful.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Dumela | doo-meh-lah | formal |\n| Hello | Khotso | koh-tsoh | informal |\n| Thank you | Ke a leboha | kay ah leh-boh-hah | formal |\n| Thank you | Nka reke | nn-kah reh-keh | informal |\n| Please | Tseba | tseh-bah | formal |\n| Yes / No | Ee / Oo | ay / oh | formal |\n| Excuse me | NTATE | nn-tah-teh | formal |\n| How much? | Joang | joh-ahng | formal |\n| Where is...? | Kae? | kah-eh | formal |\n| I don't understand | Ha ke utloe | hah kay oo-tloh-eh | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | U na ngala Seisimane? | oo nah ngah-lah seh-see-mah-neh | formal |\n| Help! | Thuso | too-soh | formal |\n| Goodbye | Sala hantle | sah-lah hahn-tleh | formal |\n| Sorry | Tseba | tseh-bah | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Nngwe | nn-gweh |\n| 2 | Pedi | peh-dee |\n| 3 | Tharo | thah-roh |\n| 4 | Nne | nn-eh |\n| 5 | Tsheelane | tsee-heh-lah-neh |\n| 6 | Tsheletsana | tsee-heh-tsah-nah |\n| 7 | Supa | soo-pah |\n| 8 | Roanela | roh-ah-neh-lah |\n| 9 | Senyane | seh-nyah-neh |\n| 10 | Lesome | leh-soh-meh |\n| 100 | Lekete | leh-keh-teh |\n| 1000 | Sekete | seh-keh-teh |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with the local people, it is customary to use formal titles such as **NTATE** (father) or **MME** (mother) until you are explicitly invited to use first names.\n- Body language is important in Lesotho, and it is considered polite to use both hands when giving or receiving something.\n- Avoid pointing with the left hand, as this is considered rude in many African cultures.\n- When bargaining, it is customary to start with a low offer and negotiate upwards.\n- It is also customary to show respect for elders and traditional leaders, such as chiefs and village headmen.\n- When communicating with the local people, be patient and take the time to listen carefully to what they are saying.\n- Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the local people.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The **Google Translate** app is a useful tool for translating Sesotho and other languages.\n- **Phrasebooks** and **language learning guides** are also available for visitors who want to learn more about the Sesotho language.\n- **Language exchange programs** are also available, which allow visitors to practice their Sesotho language skills with native speakers.\n- The **Lesotho Tourism Board** website also provides a range of language resources and translation tools for visitors.\n- Visitors can also hire a **local guide** or **interpreter** to help with communication and translation.",
