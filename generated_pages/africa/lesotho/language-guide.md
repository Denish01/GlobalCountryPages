[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Lesotho is dominated by **Sesotho**, which is spoken by the majority of the population. Sesotho is a Bantu language that is also spoken in parts of South Africa. There are several regional dialects of Sesotho, but the standard dialect is widely understood throughout the country. English is also widely spoken, particularly in urban areas and among the educated population. However, in rural areas, Sesotho is the primary language spoken. Minority languages, such as Zulu and Xhosa, are also spoken in Lesotho, particularly in areas near the South African border.

Sesotho is a tonal language, which means that the pitch and tone of words can change their meaning. The language has a complex grammar system, with many prefixes and suffixes that are used to indicate grammatical relationships. Despite the challenges of learning Sesotho, many visitors to Lesotho find that speaking a few words of the language can go a long way in terms of building relationships with the local people.

English is widely understood in Lesotho, particularly in tourist areas and among businesspeople. However, it is still a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in Sesotho, such as greetings and expressions of gratitude. This can help to show respect for the local culture and people, and can also make interactions more enjoyable and meaningful.
