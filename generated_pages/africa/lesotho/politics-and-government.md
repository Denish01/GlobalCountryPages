[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Lesotho is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the prime minister, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of government policies. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly and the Senate, which are responsible for making laws and approving government appointments. The **judicial branch** is composed of the High Court and the Court of Appeal, which are responsible for interpreting laws and resolving disputes. Lesotho has a **unitary system**, where the central government has the power to make decisions for the entire country.

The **separation of powers** is an important principle in Lesotho's government, where each branch has checks and balances on the other branches to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. For example, the National Assembly has the power to approve or reject the prime minister's appointments, while the judiciary has the power to declare laws passed by the National Assembly as unconstitutional. This system helps to ensure that power is distributed fairly and that the government is accountable to the people.

Lesotho's **parliamentary system** is based on the British model, where the prime minister is the head of government and is responsible for advising the monarch. The prime minister is also the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the National Assembly. This system allows for a stable and effective government, where the prime minister can make decisions quickly and respond to the needs of the people.
