  "content": "To get around in Lesotho, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and rental cars, as the country has a limited rail network and no metro or subway system. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Moshoeshoe I International Airport (MSU)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nLesotho's main international airport is Moshoeshoe I International Airport, located about 20 kilometers from the capital city of Maseru. The airport receives direct flights from Johannesburg in South Africa, which is a major hub with connections to many international destinations. You can also enter Lesotho overland from South Africa, with several border crossings, including the Maseru Bridge and the Van Rooyen's Gate border post. The journey from Johannesburg to Maseru by car or bus takes around 5-6 hours, depending on traffic and road conditions.\n\nIf you are coming from other parts of Africa or from outside the continent, you will likely need to fly into Johannesburg and then take a connecting flight or bus to Lesotho. There are also several bus companies that operate from Johannesburg to Maseru, including the Intercape and Translux bus services. These buses are a convenient and affordable option, with fares starting from around $20-$30 for a one-way ticket. Additionally, you can also take a taxi or shuttle from the airport to your destination, which can be more expensive but provides a door-to-door service.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nLesotho has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating within the country. The main domestic airline is Mission Aviation Fellowship, which offers charter flights to several destinations, including the Katse Dam and the Maluti Mountains. There are also a few smaller airlines that offer scenic flights and charter services. Booking domestic flights in Lesotho can be challenging, and it's often best to book through a local travel agent or tour operator. The cost of domestic flights can vary depending on the route and the airline, but you can expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nLesotho has no rail network, so train travel is not an option. The country's terrain is mountainous, which makes it difficult to build and maintain railways. As a result, most people rely on buses, taxis, and private cars to get around. However, there are plans to develop a rail network in the future, which could improve transportation links between Lesotho and its neighbors.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nBuses are a popular way to get around Lesotho, with several companies operating intercity routes. The main bus companies include the Lesotho Transport Corporation and the Maseru Bus Service, which offer daily services to most major towns and cities. The buses are generally comfortable and reliable, with fares starting from around $5-$10 for a one-way ticket. You can also use minibus taxis, known as **combis**, which are a cheaper and more flexible option. However, the combis can be crowded and may not always follow a fixed schedule.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Maseru | $0.50-$1 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $5-$10 | Metered taxis available in Maseru |\n| Ride-Hailing | Maseru | $5-$10 | Local alternatives to Uber |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | no |  | Not available in Lesotho |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Lesotho, you will need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a valid passport.\n- The road quality in Lesotho is generally moderate, with some paved roads and many gravel or dirt roads, especially in rural areas.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high in Lesotho, with petrol and diesel prices comparable to those in South Africa.\n- Car rental companies are available in Maseru and at the airport, with prices starting from around $40-$60 per day for a compact car.\n- When driving in Lesotho, be aware of the **high altitude** and potential **fog** or **rain**, which can make driving conditions hazardous.\n- It's also important to watch out for **livestock** and **pedestrians** on the roads, especially in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** and **overcharging** by taxi drivers, and always agree on a fare before you start your journey.\n- Use **local currency**, the Lesotho loti (LSL), to pay for transport, as not all drivers or operators accept foreign currency.\n- Download **maps** and **transport apps** on your smartphone to help navigate the country and find the best routes.\n- Always wear a **seatbelt** and follow **traffic rules** to ensure your safety on the roads.\n- Be prepared for **delays** and **cancellations** of transport services, especially during peak travel seasons or in bad weather.\n- Use **reputable** and **licensed** transport operators to minimize the risk of accidents or scams.\n- Learn some **basic Sesotho phrases**, such as \"hello\" (lumela) and \"thank you\" (ke a leboha), to communicate with local transport providers and show respect for the culture.",
