The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months (June to August) due to increased demand for heating and lighting. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities remains relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Lesotho is also a concern, with many households relying on alternative sources of energy, such as charcoal and firewood, due to the unreliability of the national grid. The water supply is also limited, with many areas experiencing frequent shortages and restrictions. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the utility infrastructure, with investments in renewable energy and water conservation projects.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | prepayment meters available |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in rent or separate fee |\n| **Total** | **$65** | **$110** | **$155** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Econet, Vodacom |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Econet, Vodacom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Vodacom, Econet |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Vodacom, Econet |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Vodacom, Econet |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | available in Lesotho |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Lesotho |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, contact the relevant provider (e.g. Lesotho Electricity Company, Water and Sewerage Company) and provide proof of address and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, allowing households to control their usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Lesotho are Econet and Vodacom, offering a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and harvest rainwater for non-potable purposes.\n- Consider investing in a solar water heater or solar panels to reduce reliance on the national grid and lower energy costs.",
