# The Truth About Lesotho - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Lesotho, officially known as the Kingdom of Lesotho, is a **sovereign** country located in southern Africa. The area that is now Lesotho was originally inhabited by the **San** and **Khoikhoi** peoples, but it was later settled by the **Basotho** people, who arrived in the 16th century. In the early 19th century, the Basotho kingdom was unified under the leadership of **Moshoeshoe I**, who is considered the founder of the modern Basotho nation. Lesotho was a British **protectorate** from 1868 to 1966, when it gained its independence. The country became a **constitutional monarchy** with a parliamentary system of government.

The road to independence was long and complex, with Lesotho being a British protectorate for nearly a century. During this time, the country was known as **Basutoland**. The British government controlled the country's foreign affairs, while the Basotho people had a degree of autonomy in internal matters. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Basotho people began to demand greater autonomy and eventually independence from Britain. Lesotho gained its independence on October 4, 1966, with **Moshoeshoe II** as its first king.

Lesotho's early years of independence were marked by political instability and conflict with neighboring South Africa. The country's economy was largely dependent on **agriculture** and **remittances** from Basotho workers in South Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, Lesotho experienced a series of military coups and political crises, which had a negative impact on the country's economy and stability. Today, Lesotho is a member of the **Commonwealth of Nations** and the **Southern African Development Community** (SADC).

Lesotho's history is closely tied to that of its neighbor, South Africa. The two countries share a long border and have a complex relationship that dates back to the 19th century. Lesotho's economy is still closely tied to South Africa's, with many Basotho workers employed in South African **mines** and **farms**. The country's geography, with its **mountainous** terrain and limited **arable land**, has also played a significant role in shaping its history and economy.
