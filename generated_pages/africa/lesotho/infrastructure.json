  "content": "Lesotho's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional systems, with significant investments in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors, although challenges persist, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 55% of population\nInternet Penetration: 27%\nRoad Network: 5,940 km, mostly gravel and dirt roads\nRail Network: 0 km, no rail network\nMajor Airports: 1 international, 2 domestic\nMajor Ports: 0, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nLesotho's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with significant gaps in rural areas. The government has made efforts to improve the situation, with investments in road construction, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, the country still faces challenges in providing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas. The urban-rural gap is significant, with Maseru, the capital city, having better infrastructure than rural areas. Recent investments have focused on improving the road network, expanding energy generation, and increasing access to telecommunications services.\n\nThe government has also launched initiatives to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, including the development of special economic zones and the simplification of regulatory procedures. However, the country's landlocked location and lack of direct access to ports remain significant challenges. Lesotho relies heavily on neighboring South Africa for trade and transportation, which can increase costs and reduce competitiveness. Despite these challenges, the government is working to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on a few key sectors, such as textiles and mining.\n\nLesotho's infrastructure development is also influenced by its geography, with the country's mountainous terrain making it difficult and expensive to build and maintain infrastructure. The country's climate is also a challenge, with frequent droughts and floods affecting the availability of water and the stability of roads and other infrastructure. However, the government is working to mitigate these challenges, with investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and initiatives to improve disaster risk management.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 5,940 km | Moderate | Mostly gravel and dirt roads, with some paved roads in urban areas |\n| Railways | 0 km | N/A | No rail network in Lesotho |\n| Airports | 3 (1 international, 2 domestic) | Good | Main airport is Moshoeshoe I International Airport |\n| Ports | 0 | N/A | Landlocked, relies on South African ports for international trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Lesotho's power generation is mostly based on **hydroelectric power**, with the 'Muela Hydropower Plant being the main source of electricity.\n- The country has made progress in increasing access to electricity, with the **rural electrification program** aiming to connect all villages to the grid by 2025.\n- However, the power supply is not always reliable, with frequent **outages** affecting businesses and households.\n- Lesotho has also made efforts to promote **renewable energy**, with several solar and wind power projects under development.\n- The government has set a target to increase the share of **renewable energy** in the energy mix to 20% by 2030.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is not always safe to drink, with many households relying on **rainwater harvesting** or **boreholes** for their water needs.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively low, with many households using **pit latrines** or **open defecation**.\n- Access to **water** is a significant challenge in rural areas, with many households having to travel long distances to collect water from **rivers** or **springs**.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water supply** and **sanitation**, including the construction of new **water treatment plants** and **sewerage systems**.\n- However, more needs to be done to address the **water and sanitation gap**, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively good, with most of the population having access to **2G** or **3G** networks.\n- **Fiber optic** connections are available in some urban areas, but **broadband** penetration is still relatively low.\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote **4G** and **5G** rollout, with several **mobile operators** investing in network upgrades.\n- **Postal services** are available, but **courier services** are often preferred for **package delivery**.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to promote **e-government** and **digital literacy**, with several **online services** available for citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Lesotho Highlands Water Project** is a major **infrastructure project** aimed at increasing water supply and hydroelectric power generation.\n- The **Maseru City Development Project** aims to improve **urban infrastructure**, including roads, water supply, and sanitation.\n- The **Lesotho Transport Infrastructure Project** aims to upgrade **roads** and **airports**, with funding from the **World Bank** and **African Development Bank**.\n- The **Renewable Energy Development Project** aims to promote **solar** and **wind power** development, with funding from the **European Union**.\n- The **Digital Lesotho Project** aims to promote **digital literacy** and **e-government**, with funding from the **United Nations Development Programme**.",
