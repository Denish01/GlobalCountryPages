The language of instruction is primarily **Sesotho**, with **English** being introduced in the later years of primary school. Compulsory education lasts for 7 years, from age 6 to 13, and is free for all citizens. However, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the school and location, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed schools than rural areas. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of **Maseru**, and offer a more expensive but often higher-quality alternative, with a curriculum that is typically based on the **British** or **American** system.\n\nPrivate schools in Lesotho are generally considered to be of higher quality than public schools, with better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more rigorous curriculum. However, they are also more expensive, and can be out of reach for many families.
