The Basotho people, the main ethnic group in Lesotho, have a rich tradition of cooking and food preservation, with many dishes centered around **papa** (maize meal) and **samp** (dried corn kernels). The country's cuisine has also been shaped by its colonial past, with British and Dutch influences evident in dishes like **braaivleis** (barbecued meat) and **malva pudding** (a sweet dessert). Regional variations are also notable, with the lowlands and highlands offering distinct culinary experiences.\n\nLesotho's cuisine is often simple, yet flavorful, with a focus on local ingredients and traditional cooking methods. **Matoho**, a type of spinach, is a staple ingredient in many dishes, and is often served with **papa** or **samp**. Meat, particularly beef and mutton, is also a key component of Lesotho's cuisine, with **braaivleis** (barbecued meat) being a popular dish. In larger towns and cities, international cuisine is also available, with a range of restaurants serving everything from Chinese and Indian to Italian and American food.\n\nDespite the growing availability of international cuisine, traditional Lesotho dishes remain a staple of the country's food culture. **Motoho**, the national dish, is a thick, fermented porridge made from maize meal, and is often served with **matoho** or **samp**. This comforting dish is a reflection of Lesotho's rich culinary heritage, and is a must-try for visitors to the country.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[ TABLE ]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Motoho | Traditional | Thick, fermented porridge made from maize meal | Local restaurants and markets |\n| Papa le Matoho | Traditional | Maize meal served with spinach | Local restaurants and markets |\n| Braaivleis | Barbecued | Barbecued meat, often served with papa or samp | Local restaurants and markets |\n| Samp and Beans | Traditional | Dried corn kernels served with beans | Local restaurants and markets |\n| Malva Pudding | Dessert | Sweet dessert made with apricot jam and served with a creamy sauce | Local restaurants and cafes |\n| Sesotho Salad | Salad | Mixed greens, tomatoes, and onions, often served with a citrus vinaigrette | Local restaurants and cafes |\n| Maseru Meat Pie | Savory Pastry | Flaky pastry filled with beef or mutton | Local bakeries and cafes |\n| Morogo | Traditional | Wild spinach stew made with meat or beans | Local restaurants and markets |\n| Tsamma Melon | Fruit | Type of melon often eaten fresh or used in salads | Local markets and fruit stands |\n| Fat Cakes | Snack | Fried dough cakes often served with a sweet or savory filling | Local markets and street food stalls |\n[/TABLE ]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Fat Cakes**: Fried dough cakes often served with a sweet or savory filling ($1-2 USD)\n- **Samp and Beans**: Dried corn kernels served with beans ($2-3 USD)\n- **Braaivleis**: Barbecued meat, often served with papa or samp ($5-7 USD)\n- **Motoho**: Thick, fermented porridge made from maize meal ($3-5 USD)\n- **Tsamma Melon**: Type of melon often eaten fresh or used in salads ($1-2 USD)\n- **Boerewors Rolls**: Grilled sausage served in a roll with toppings ($3-5 USD)\n- **Malva Pudding**: Sweet dessert made with apricot jam and served with a creamy sauce ($4-6 USD)\n- **Papa le Matoho**: Maize meal served with spinach ($3-5 USD)\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Maltabella**: Traditional drink made from fermented maize meal\n- **Umqombothi**: Traditional beer made from fermented maize meal\n- **Fresh Fruit Juice**: Freshly squeezed juice made from local fruits like oranges and grapefruits\n- **Rooibos Tea**: Caffeine-free tea made from the leaves of the Rooibos plant\n- **Castle Lager**: Local beer brewed in South Africa\n- **Amasi**: Traditional drink made from fermented milk\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with Your Hands**: It is customary to eat with your hands, particularly when eating traditional dishes like **papa** and **samp**\n- **Tipping**: 10% of the total bill is customary\n- **Reservations**: Reservations are not always necessary, but are recommended for larger groups or special occasions\n- **Dress Code**: Dress codes are generally casual, but more formal attire may be required for higher-end restaurants\n- **Table Manners**: Table manners are generally informal, but it is customary to wait for the host to invite you to eat before starting your meal\n- **Trying New Foods**: Visitors are encouraged to try new foods and drinks, and to ask questions about local cuisine and customs\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local Restaurants**: Traditional restaurants serving local dishes like **motoho** and **papa le matoho**\n- **Markets**: Local markets offering a range of traditional dishes and snacks\n- **Food Courts**: Food courts in larger towns and cities offering a range of international and local cuisine\n- **Cafes**: Cafes serving coffee, tea, and light meals like **malva pudding** and **fat cakes**\n- **Street Food Stalls**: Street food stalls offering traditional snacks like **braaivleis** and **boerewors rolls**\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Maseru Market**: Local market offering a range of traditional dishes and snacks\n- **Hlotse Market**: Market in the town of Hlotse offering traditional dishes and local crafts\n- **Morija Market**: Market in the town of Morija offering traditional dishes and local crafts\n- **Lesotho Brewing Company**: Brewery offering tours and tastings of local beers\n- **Maseru Food Festival**: Annual food festival celebrating local cuisine and culture",
