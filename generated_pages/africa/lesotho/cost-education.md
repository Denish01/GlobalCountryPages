[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Lesotho is divided into public and private schools, with the public system being generally considered to be of lower quality due to limited resources and infrastructure. The language of instruction is primarily **Sesotho**, with **English** being introduced in the later years of primary school. Compulsory education lasts for 7 years, from age 6 to 13, and is free for all citizens. However, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the school and location, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed schools than rural areas. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of **Maseru**, and offer a more expensive but often higher-quality alternative, with a curriculum that is typically based on the **British** or **American** system.

Private schools in Lesotho are generally considered to be of higher quality than public schools, with better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more rigorous curriculum. However, they are also more expensive, and can be out of reach for many families. International schools, on the other hand, offer a unique blend of **local** and **international** curricula, and are often preferred by expat families and those seeking a more **global** education. Despite the challenges facing the education system in Lesotho, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with **enrollment rates** increasing and **literacy rates** improving.
