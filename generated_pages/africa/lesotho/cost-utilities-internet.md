[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Lesotho's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages affecting many areas. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months (June to August) due to increased demand for heating and lighting. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities remains relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

The quality of utility services in Lesotho is also a concern, with many households relying on alternative sources of energy, such as charcoal and firewood, due to the unreliability of the national grid. The water supply is also limited, with many areas experiencing frequent shortages and restrictions. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the utility infrastructure, with investments in renewable energy and water conservation projects.
