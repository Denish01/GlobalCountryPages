# Lesotho History — Key Events & Timeline

Lesotho has a rich and diverse history that spans from the earliest known inhabitants of the region to the present day, with significant events and periods shaping the country into the sovereign nation it is today.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Lesotho began with the arrival of the **San** people, who were the earliest known inhabitants of the region, dating back to around 30,000 years ago. The San were later joined by the **Khoi** people, who migrated to the area from the north, and together they developed a unique culture and way of life. In the 16th century, the **Basotho** people, who were a branch of the **Bantu** people, arrived in the region and eventually established the Kingdom of Lesotho. The Basotho people were skilled farmers and herdsmen, and they developed a complex system of government and social organization.

During the 19th century, Lesotho was affected by the **Scramble for Africa**, as European powers, including the British and the Boers, competed for control of the continent. In 1868, Lesotho became a **British protectorate**, and it remained under British control until it gained independence in 1966. The colonial period had a significant impact on Lesotho, as the British imposed their own system of government and economy on the country, and they also introduced **Christianity** and **Western education**. The Basotho people resisted the colonial powers, and they fought several wars to maintain their independence and way of life.

In the 20th century, Lesotho began to move towards independence, with the **Basutoland Congress Party** and the **Basutoland National Party** emerging as major political forces. In 1966, Lesotho gained its independence from Britain, with **Moshoeshoe II** as its first king and **Leabua Jonathan** as its first prime minister. Since then, Lesotho has experienced significant political and economic changes, including the introduction of a **constitutional monarchy** and the development of a **mixed economy**. Today, Lesotho is a sovereign nation with a diverse culture and economy, and it continues to play an important role in regional and international affairs.

The country's history has been shaped by its unique cultural heritage and its strategic location in southern Africa. Lesotho's **mountainous terrain** has made it a challenging but rewarding place to live, with a strong sense of community and resilience among its people. The country's history has also been influenced by its relationships with neighboring countries, including South Africa, with which it shares a long and complex border.
