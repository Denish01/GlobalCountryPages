[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Lesotho's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private facilities available. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, but often lacks in quality and resources, with long wait times and limited access to specialized care. Private facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, public healthcare is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those with private insurance may opt for private facilities. It is recommended to have some form of health insurance when visiting or living in Lesotho, as medical costs can quickly add up, especially in private facilities.

The healthcare system in Lesotho is also faced with challenges such as a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, limited access to medical equipment and supplies, and a high burden of diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities. However, more work needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between public and private facilities.

- **Prescription medication** can be purchased at a cost of $5-$20 per month, depending on the type and quantity.
- **Over-the-counter medication** is widely available at pharmacies and general stores, with prices ranging from $2-$10.
- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.

- **Common medications** such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available, but specialized medications may be harder to find.
- **Vaccinations** are available at public health clinics and private hospitals, with costs ranging from $10-$50 per dose.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call 112 or 123 for police, fire, or ambulance services. Ambulance availability can be limited, especially in rural areas, and response times may be slow. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek care at private hospitals, which generally have better facilities and equipment. The **Queen Mamohato Memorial Hospital** in Maseru is one of the best-equipped hospitals in the country and is a good option for emergency care. However, even at private hospitals, emergency care can be limited, and evacuation to South Africa or other countries may be necessary in serious cases. It is essential to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including access to a reliable ambulance service and evacuation options.
