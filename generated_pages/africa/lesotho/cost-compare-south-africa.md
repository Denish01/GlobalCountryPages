[SECTION] Overview: Lesotho vs South Africa [/SECTION]
Lesotho and South Africa are neighboring countries in Southern Africa, with distinct economic profiles. Lesotho has a smaller economy, with a GDP per capita of $3,390, compared to South Africa's $13,440. The cost of living in Lesotho is generally lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more affordable. The country's economy is largely driven by agriculture, manufacturing, and remittances from workers in South Africa. In contrast, South Africa has a more diversified economy, with a strong services sector and a significant mining industry. The country's cost of living is higher, reflecting its more developed economy and higher standard of living.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a role in shaping their cost of living. Lesotho's economy is heavily reliant on South Africa, with many Basotho workers employed in South African mines and factories. This has led to a significant flow of remittances into Lesotho, which has helped to boost the country's economy. However, it also means that Lesotho's economy is vulnerable to fluctuations in the South African economy. In contrast, South Africa has a more diversified economy, with a strong services sector and a significant manufacturing base. This has helped to drive economic growth and increase the country's standard of living, but it also means that prices for goods and services are higher.
