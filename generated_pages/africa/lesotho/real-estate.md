[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Lesotho is relatively small and largely driven by the demand for housing from the local population and expatriates working in the country. The market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern housing, with a growing trend towards urbanization. The capital city, Maseru, is the hub of economic activity and has the most developed property market, with a range of options available, from apartments to single-family homes. The price trajectory in Lesotho has been steadily increasing over the years, driven by demand from the growing middle class and limited supply of housing. However, the market is still relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region.

The urban areas, such as Maseru and Hlotse, have a more developed property market, with a range of options available, including apartments, houses, and commercial properties. In contrast, the rural areas have a more traditional housing market, with a focus on **agricultural land** and **rural homesteads**. The demand for property in rural areas is largely driven by the local population, who are looking for affordable housing options.

The Lesotho property market is also influenced by the country's proximity to South Africa, with many Basotho people working in South Africa and investing in property in Lesotho. This has led to an increase in demand for property, particularly in the urban areas, and has driven up prices. However, the market is still relatively small and can be volatile, with prices fluctuating in response to changes in the economy and demand.
