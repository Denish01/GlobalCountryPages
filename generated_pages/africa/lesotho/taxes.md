The tax system in Lesotho is administered by the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA), which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs duties, and other revenue. The LRA also provides guidance and support to taxpayers, including expats and businesses, to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations. Lesotho has a relatively simple tax system, with a limited number of tax rates and a straightforward tax return process.
