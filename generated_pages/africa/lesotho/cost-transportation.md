[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Lesotho's transportation network is relatively underdeveloped, with a lack of modern infrastructure and limited public transportation options. The main modes of transportation in Lesotho are **minibuses**, **taxis**, and **private vehicles**, with most people relying on these options to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with limited coverage and unreliable schedules, making it difficult for people to access basic services and amenities. As a result, many people in Lesotho rely on **walking** or **cycling** as their primary mode of transportation.

The lack of a well-developed public transportation system in Lesotho makes it challenging for people to move around, especially in rural areas where **off-road vehicles** are often the only option. The government has been working to improve the transportation network, with plans to upgrade roads and introduce new public transportation systems. However, for now, the transportation options in Lesotho remain limited, and people often have to rely on **informal transportation** options, such as hitchhiking or using unlicensed taxis.
