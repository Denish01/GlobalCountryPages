[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Lesotho is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, with a deposit of 1-2 months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the Lesotho Land Act, which provides for fair rent, security of tenure, and protection against eviction. Compared to its regional neighbors, Lesotho's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to live and work in the region. However, the market can be competitive, particularly in the city center, where demand for housing is high.

The housing market in Lesotho is also influenced by the country's economy, which is largely driven by agriculture and textiles. The country's GDP per capita is relatively low, which can make it challenging for locals to afford housing, particularly in the city center. However, the government has implemented initiatives to increase access to affordable housing, including the development of new housing estates and the provision of subsidies for low-income households. For expats, the cost of living in Lesotho is relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to live and work in the region.
