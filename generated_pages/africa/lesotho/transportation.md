[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Lesotho's main international airport is Moshoeshoe I International Airport, located about 20 kilometers from the capital city of Maseru. The airport receives direct flights from Johannesburg in South Africa, which is a major hub with connections to many international destinations. You can also enter Lesotho overland from South Africa, with several border crossings, including the Maseru Bridge and the Van Rooyen's Gate border post. The journey from Johannesburg to Maseru by car or bus takes around 5-6 hours, depending on traffic and road conditions.

If you are coming from other parts of Africa or from outside the continent, you will likely need to fly into Johannesburg and then take a connecting flight or bus to Lesotho. There are also several bus companies that operate from Johannesburg to Maseru, including the Intercape and Translux bus services. These buses are a convenient and affordable option, with fares starting from around $20-$30 for a one-way ticket. Additionally, you can also take a taxi or shuttle from the airport to your destination, which can be more expensive but provides a door-to-door service.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Lesotho has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating within the country. The main domestic airline is Mission Aviation Fellowship, which offers charter flights to several destinations, including the Katse Dam and the Maluti Mountains. There are also a few smaller airlines that offer scenic flights and charter services. Booking domestic flights in Lesotho can be challenging, and it's often best to book through a local travel agent or tour operator. The cost of domestic flights can vary depending on the route and the airline, but you can expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Lesotho has no rail network, so train travel is not an option. The country's terrain is mountainous, which makes it difficult to build and maintain railways. As a result, most people rely on buses, taxis, and private cars to get around. However, there are plans to develop a rail network in the future, which could improve transportation links between Lesotho and its neighbors.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses are a popular way to get around Lesotho, with several companies operating intercity routes. The main bus companies include the Lesotho Transport Corporation and the Maseru Bus Service, which offer daily services to most major towns and cities. The buses are generally comfortable and reliable, with fares starting from around $5-$10 for a one-way ticket. You can also use minibus taxis, known as **combis**, which are a cheaper and more flexible option. However, the combis can be crowded and may not always follow a fixed schedule.
