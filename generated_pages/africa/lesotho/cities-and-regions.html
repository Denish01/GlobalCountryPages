        <h2>How Lesotho Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Lesotho is divided into 10 districts, which are further subdivided into 80 constituencies.

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Lesotho has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with several options for domestic travel. The country has a number of airports, including the Moshoeshoe I International Airport, which is located near the capital city Maseru. There are also several bus companies that operate throughout the country, offering affordable and convenient travel options. The road network is generally good, with several major highways connecting the main towns and cities. However, the roads in the mountains can be challenging, especially during the rainy season. Visitors can also rent cars or hire taxis to get around, but driving conditions can be hazardous, especially at night or in remote areas.</p>
        <p>Domestic flights are available between the main towns and cities, but are relatively expensive. The bus network is more affordable and convenient, with several companies operating throughout the country. The road network is generally good, but driving conditions can be challenging, especially in the mountains. Visitors should exercise caution when driving, especially at night or in remote areas, and should consider hiring a local driver or guide if they are not familiar with the roads.
