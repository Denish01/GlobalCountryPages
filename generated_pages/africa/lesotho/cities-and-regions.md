[SECTION] How Lesotho Is Divided [/SECTION]
Lesotho is divided into 10 districts, which are further subdivided into 80 constituencies. The districts are Berea, Butha-Buthe, Leribe, Mafeteng, Maseru, Mohale's Hoek, Mokhotlong, Qacha's Nek, Quthing, and Thaba-Tseka. Each district has its own administrative center and is responsible for providing local services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The government of Lesotho has a decentralized system, with power divided between the national government and the local authorities.

The administrative structure of Lesotho is designed to provide effective governance and service delivery to the population. The 10 districts are grouped into three main regions: the lowlands, the foothills, and the mountains. The lowlands are the most populous region, with the capital city Maseru located in this area. The foothills are known for their fertile soil and are the main agricultural region of the country. The mountains are the most sparsely populated region, with limited access to services and infrastructure.
