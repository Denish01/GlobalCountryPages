# Lesotho Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Lesotho's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional systems, with significant investments in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors, although challenges persist, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 55% of population
Internet Penetration: 27%
Road Network: 5,940 km, mostly gravel and dirt roads
Rail Network: 0 km, no rail network
Major Airports: 1 international, 2 domestic
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Lesotho's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with significant gaps in rural areas. The government has made efforts to improve the situation, with investments in road construction, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, the country still faces challenges in providing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas. The urban-rural gap is significant, with Maseru, the capital city, having better infrastructure than rural areas. Recent investments have focused on improving the road network, expanding energy generation, and increasing access to telecommunications services.

The government has also launched initiatives to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, including the development of special economic zones and the simplification of regulatory procedures. However, the country's landlocked location and lack of direct access to ports remain significant challenges. Lesotho relies heavily on neighboring South Africa for trade and transportation, which can increase costs and reduce competitiveness. Despite these challenges, the government is working to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on a few key sectors, such as textiles and mining.

Lesotho's infrastructure development is also influenced by its geography, with the country's mountainous terrain making it difficult and expensive to build and maintain infrastructure. The country's climate is also a challenge, with frequent droughts and floods affecting the availability of water and the stability of roads and other infrastructure. However, the government is working to mitigate these challenges, with investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and initiatives to improve disaster risk management.
