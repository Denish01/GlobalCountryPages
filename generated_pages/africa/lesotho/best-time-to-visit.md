[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Lesotho: September to November and March to May. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: April to May and September to November.

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Lesotho has a temperate climate, with four distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The country's high altitude and mountainous terrain contribute to its unique climate, with significant temperature variations between day and night. The dry season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by clear skies, mild temperatures, and minimal rainfall. In contrast, the wet season, from October to April, brings significant rainfall, often in the form of thunderstorms, and higher temperatures. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Lesotho, with the dry season being the best time for hiking, pony trekking, and other outdoor activities, while the wet season is better suited for birdwatching and exploring the country's scenic landscapes.

Lesotho's climate can be divided into three main zones: the lowlands, the mountains, and the highlands. The lowlands, which include the capital city Maseru, have a more subtropical climate, with hot summers and mild winters. The mountains, which cover most of the country, have a temperate climate, with cold winters and mild summers. The highlands, which include the Maluti Mountains, have a harsh, alpine climate, with cold temperatures and significant snowfall during the winter months.

The seasons also affect the country's infrastructure and accessibility. During the wet season, some roads may become impassable due to flooding or landslides, while during the dry season, the roads are generally in good condition, making it easier to get around. Additionally, the seasons influence the availability of certain activities, such as skiing and snowboarding, which are only possible during the winter months.
