The Basotho people, the main ethnic group in Lesotho, have a rich tradition of cooking and food preservation, with many dishes centered around **papa** (maize meal) and **samp** (dried corn kernels). The country's cuisine has also been shaped by its colonial past, with British and Dutch influences evident in dishes like **braaivleis** (barbecued meat) and **malva pudding** (a sweet dessert). Regional variations are also notable, with the lowlands and highlands offering distinct culinary experiences.

Lesotho's cuisine is often simple, yet flavorful, with a focus on local ingredients and traditional cooking methods. **Matoho**, a type of spinach, is a staple ingredient in many dishes, and is often served with **papa** or **samp**. Meat, particularly beef and mutton, is also a key component of Lesotho's cuisine, with **braaivleis** (barbecued meat) being a popular dish. In larger towns and cities, international cuisine is also available, with a range of restaurants serving everything from Chinese and Indian to Italian and American food.

Despite the growing availability of international cuisine, traditional Lesotho dishes remain a staple of the country's food culture. **Motoho**, the national dish, is a thick, fermented porridge made from maize meal, and is often served with **matoho** or **samp**. This comforting dish is a reflection of Lesotho's rich culinary heritage, and is a must-try for visitors to the country.
