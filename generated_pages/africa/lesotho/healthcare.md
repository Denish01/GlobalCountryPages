[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Lesotho's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private sectors providing services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including limited resources, a shortage of medical professionals, and a high burden of infectious diseases. The private sector, on the other hand, is relatively small and mostly caters to the affluent population. The quality of care in Lesotho is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, with a **RATING: 2/5**. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where services are often limited and of poorer quality.

The government of Lesotho has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a **National Health Policy** and a **Health Sector Strategic Plan**. These initiatives aim to improve access to healthcare services, particularly for vulnerable populations, and to strengthen the health system as a whole. Despite these efforts, significant challenges remain, and the healthcare system in Lesotho continues to face numerous obstacles. The country has a high burden of infectious diseases, including **HIV/AIDS**, **tuberculosis**, and **malaria**, which puts a significant strain on the healthcare system.

The healthcare system in Lesotho is also affected by the country's **geography** and **climate**. Lesotho is a mountainous country, and many areas are difficult to access, particularly during the winter months. This can make it challenging for people to access healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. The country's climate is also characterized by extreme temperatures, which can exacerbate health problems, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children.
