        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Lesotho's culture is deeply rooted in its history and traditions, with a strong emphasis on community and respect for elders. The country is home to the Basotho people, who make up the majority of the population. The Basotho are a Bantu-speaking people who have a rich cultural heritage, with their own language, customs, and traditions. The country's cultural identity is also influenced by its history as a British protectorate, as well as its proximity to South Africa. As a result, Lesotho's culture is a unique blend of traditional and modern elements, with a strong emphasis on preserving its heritage.</p>
        <p>The Basotho people are known for their hospitality and welcoming nature, and visitors to Lesotho are often greeted with a warm smile and a traditional greeting. The country's cultural identity is also reflected in its traditional dress, which includes the iconic <strong>blanket</strong> and <strong>traditional hat</strong>. The blanket, known as a <strong>seana</strong>, is a thick, woolen blanket that is worn over the shoulders, while the traditional hat, known as a <strong>mokorotlo</strong>, is a conical hat made from grass or straw. These traditional garments are an important part of Basotho culture and are often worn on special occasions.</p>
        <p>Lesotho's cultural identity is also influenced by its ethnic and linguistic makeup. The majority of the population speaks <strong>Sesotho</strong>, which is the national language, while <strong>English</strong> is also widely spoken.
