# Tunisia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Tunisia is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications, but still faces challenges in terms of rural-urban disparities and aging facilities. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 99% of population
Internet Penetration: 64%
Road Network: 19,997 km, moderate quality with some paved highways
Rail Network: 2,167 km
Major Airports: 8
Major Ports: 8
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Tunisia has made significant investments in its infrastructure over the past few decades, with a focus on modernizing its transportation networks, expanding its energy generation capacity, and improving its telecommunications systems. However, despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of rural-urban disparities, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's road network, expanding its port facilities, and developing its renewable energy sector. The government has also launched initiatives to improve the business climate and attract foreign investment, which is expected to drive further infrastructure development.

The country's infrastructure development has been driven by a combination of public and private sector investment, with the government playing a key role in planning and regulating the sector. However, the pace of development has been slow, and the country still faces significant challenges in terms of financing and implementing large-scale infrastructure projects. Despite these challenges, Tunisia has made significant progress in recent years, and its infrastructure is now considered to be among the most developed in the region.

One of the major challenges facing Tunisia's infrastructure development is the need to balance the requirements of different regions and sectors. The country's rural areas are often poorly served by basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and water, while the urban areas are often congested and lacking in modern amenities. The government has launched initiatives to address these disparities, including programs to upgrade rural roads and expand access to basic services.
