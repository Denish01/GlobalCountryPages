[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Tunisia has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot summers and mild winters. The country can be divided into several climate zones, including the coastal region, the mountains, and the desert. The coastal region has a mild climate, with average temperatures ranging from 12°C to 28°C (54°F to 82°F) throughout the year. The mountainous regions are cooler, with significant rainfall during the winter months, while the desert region is extremely hot during the summer and cold during the winter. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is the best time to visit the desert region, while the wet season, which runs from November to April, is ideal for visiting the coastal and mountainous regions.

The seasons in Tunisia have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season being the summer months when tourists flock to the beaches and resorts. However, this is also the hottest time of the year, with temperatures often reaching 38°C (100°F) or more. The shoulder season, which includes the spring and autumn months, is a great time to visit Tunisia, as the weather is mild and pleasant, and the crowds are smaller. The winter months are the low season, with cooler temperatures and fewer tourists, making it a great time to explore the country's cities and historical sites.

The seasonal variations in Tunisia also affect the types of activities and experiences that are available. For example, the summer months are ideal for water sports and beach activities, while the spring and autumn months are better suited for hiking and exploring the countryside. The winter months are a great time to visit the country's museums and historical sites, as well as to experience the local culture and cuisine.
