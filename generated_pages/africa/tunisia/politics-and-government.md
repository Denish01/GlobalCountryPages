[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Tunisian government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term, and the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the President. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People, a unicameral parliament with 217 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Constitutional Court, the Court of Cassation, and other lower courts. The system of government is designed to provide a balance of power between the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the others.

The Tunisian political system is based on the principles of **democracy**, **pluralism**, and **human rights**. The Constitution, adopted in 2014, enshrines these principles and provides a framework for the organization of the state and the relationship between the government and citizens. The system is designed to promote **transparency**, **accountability**, and **participation**, with mechanisms for citizens to engage in the decision-making process and hold elected officials accountable.

The Tunisian government has made significant progress in recent years in consolidating its democratic institutions and promoting **good governance**. However, challenges remain, including the need to strengthen the rule of law, promote economic development, and address social and regional disparities. The government has also faced challenges related to **terrorism** and **security**, particularly in the aftermath of the 2015 terrorist attacks.
