The governorates are further divided into municipalities, which are the basic administrative units in the country. This division allows for a more decentralized approach to governance, enabling local authorities to address specific regional needs and concerns. The administrative structure is overseen by the central government, which is responsible for setting national policies and ensuring the overall development of the country.\n\nThe division of Tunisia into governorates is based on geographical, economic, and historical factors. Each governorate has its own unique character, with some being predominantly urban, while others are more rural. The governorates are also home to a range of industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, which contribute to the country's economy. Understanding the administrative structure of Tunisia is essential for anyone looking to explore the country, as it helps to identify the different regions and their characteristics.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Tunis** (2,365,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, vibrant medina, and modern amenities\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and business travelers\n**Sfax** (330,000)\nRole: economic hub, port city\nKnown For: its ancient medina, beautiful beaches, and thriving commercial center\nBest For: those interested in history, commerce, and relaxation\n**Sousse** (220,000)\nRole: tourist hub, port city\nKnown For: its beautiful beaches, historic ribat, and lively nightlife\nBest For: tourists, partygoers, and water sports enthusiasts\n**Monastir** (100,000)\nRole: cultural center, tourist hub\nKnown For: its historic ribat, beautiful beaches, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: cultural enthusiasts, history buffs, and families\n**Kairouan** (140,000)\nRole: cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its rich Islamic heritage, beautiful architecture, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: cultural enthusiasts, history buffs, and those interested in Islamic studies\n**Tozeur** (40,000)\nRole: tourist hub, desert oasis\nKnown For: its stunning natural beauty, historic architecture, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: nature lovers, adventure seekers, and those interested in desert culture\n**Gabès** (130,000)\nRole: economic hub, port city\nKnown For: its beautiful beaches, historic medina, and thriving commercial center\nBest For: those interested in history, commerce, and relaxation\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Northern Tunisia | mountainous, forested | beautiful beaches, historic sites | Bizerte |\n| Central Tunisia | agricultural, rural | ancient ruins, traditional villages | Kairouan |\n| Southern Tunisia | desert, oases | stunning natural beauty, desert culture | Tozeur |\n| Coastal Tunisia | urban, touristy | beautiful beaches, vibrant nightlife | Sousse |\n| Sahel Region | coastal, agricultural | historic sites, beautiful beaches | Monastir |\n| Dorsale Mountains | mountainous, forested | hiking, skiing, scenic views | Ain Draham |\n| Tunisian Sahara | desert, oases | stunning natural beauty, desert culture | Douz |\n| Cap Bon Peninsula | coastal, rural | beautiful beaches, historic sites | Nabeul |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The north of Tunisia is more mountainous and forested, with a strong focus on agriculture and forestry, while the south is dominated by the desert and oases.\n- The coastal regions are more urban and touristy, with a strong focus on commerce and tourism, while the interior is more rural and traditional.\n- The climate varies significantly across the country, with the north being cooler and more humid, while the south is hotter and drier.\n- The culture and language also vary across the country, with Arabic being the dominant language, but with French and other languages also widely spoken, particularly in the north and among the educated elite.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nTunisia has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and taxis available.
