  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Tunisia varies between public and private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $318, and out-of-pocket expenses making up about 37.9% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $318\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 37.9%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 190\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: TND\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nTunisia has a mixed healthcare system, combining both public and private facilities, with varying levels of quality and accessibility. Public healthcare facilities are generally less expensive, but may have longer wait times and less advanced equipment, while private facilities offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally more accessible, with many citizens covered under the national health insurance program. However, foreigners may find that private facilities are more geared towards their needs, with many doctors and staff speaking English and other languages. While health insurance is not strictly required, it is highly recommended for foreigners, as medical costs can add up quickly, and many private facilities may require payment upfront.\n\nThe healthcare system in Tunisia is generally well-regarded, with many high-quality facilities and well-trained medical professionals. However, there can be significant differences in quality and accessibility between urban and rural areas, with many rural areas having limited access to healthcare facilities and specialized care. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private facilities, which may have more advanced equipment and better-trained staff. Additionally, many private facilities have international accreditation, such as the Joint Commission International (JCI), which can provide an added level of assurance for foreigners seeking medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public facilities may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private facilities may have more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private facilities may have more advanced equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public facilities may have limited eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private facilities may have more comprehensive testing options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Private facilities may have more advanced emergency care |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | Public facilities may have limited availability of private rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | Private facilities may have more advanced surgical equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Public facilities may have limited availability of private rooms |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private facilities may have more advanced imaging equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public facilities may have limited availability of imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public facilities, basic medical care, and emergency services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private facilities, specialized care, and comprehensive medical services |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | International coverage, including evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as antibiotics and pain relievers, can cost between $5-$20 per prescription\n- Prescription rules are generally similar to those in Western countries, with many medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Pharmacies are widely available, with many locations in urban areas\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as cold and flu remedies, can be purchased without a prescription\n- Some medications, such as controlled substances, may have limited availability or require special permits\n- Prices for medications can vary significantly between public and private pharmacies, with private pharmacies often charging more\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 190, or seek care at the nearest hospital. Many hospitals, particularly private facilities, have emergency departments that are equipped to handle a wide range of medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private facilities, which may have more advanced equipment and better-trained staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Tunisia include the Clinique Taoufik, the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Habib Bourguiba, and the Clinique El Amen. Additionally, many private facilities have international accreditation, such as the Joint Commission International (JCI), which can provide an added level of assurance for foreigners seeking medical care.\n\nIt is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency care, including having a list of emergency contact numbers and knowing the location of the nearest hospital. Many private facilities also offer emergency services, such as ambulance transport and emergency room care, which can be paid for out-of-pocket or through health insurance. For foreigners, it is often recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency care, as medical costs can add up quickly. Additionally, many private facilities may require payment upfront, so it is recommended to have a means of payment, such as cash or credit cards, readily available.",
