[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Tunisia's healthcare system is structured around a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector providing the majority of healthcare services, especially in rural areas. The quality of care in Tunisia is generally good, with many well-trained medical professionals, although the public sector often faces challenges related to funding and resource allocation. Urban areas, such as Tunis and Sfax, tend to have better-equipped and better-staffed hospitals, while rural areas often have more limited access to healthcare services. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality care, often with modern facilities and equipment, but at a higher cost.

The public healthcare system in Tunisia is generally affordable, with many services subsidized by the government, although some services may require out-of-pocket payments. The private sector, however, can be quite expensive, and medical insurance is often required to access these services. Tunisia has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas, and improving the quality of care.

Despite these efforts, there are still challenges to be addressed, including a shortage of medical professionals in some areas, limited access to specialized care, and a need for ongoing investment in healthcare infrastructure. Overall, Tunisia's healthcare system offers a good standard of care, especially in urban areas, although there are still areas for improvement, particularly in terms of access and equity.
