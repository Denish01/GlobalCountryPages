However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable connections available in major cities like Tunis and Sfax, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The internet infrastructure in Tunisia is mostly reliable, with few reported cases of major outages or disruptions, but the quality of service can vary depending on the provider and location.\n\nThe Tunisian government has made efforts to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the deployment of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks. As a result, internet penetration has increased significantly in recent years, with over 60% of the population now having access to the internet. However, there are still some challenges to be addressed, including the high cost of internet services and the limited availability of high-speed connections in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Tunisia is relatively straightforward, with several mobile providers offering tourist-friendly plans.
