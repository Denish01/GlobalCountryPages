Tunisia's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a high percentage of the population having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning and water. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the cost of utilities can still vary depending on the provider and usage. Overall, the quality of utility infrastructure in Tunisia is good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water, but the cost can be a challenge for some households.
