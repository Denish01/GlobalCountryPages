[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Tunisia's rental market is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms in Tunisia are for one to three years, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights in Tunisia are protected by law, with the tenant having the right to renew their lease and the landlord required to provide a minimum of six months' notice before terminating the lease. Compared to its regional neighbors, Algeria and Libya, Tunisia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a balance between affordability and quality of life.

The housing market in Tunisia has experienced growth in recent years, driven by government initiatives to increase affordable housing options and attract foreign investment. However, the market can be competitive, particularly in popular areas such as the capital city, Tunis. As a result, it's essential for renters to be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property, and to be aware of their rights and responsibilities as a tenant in Tunisia.
