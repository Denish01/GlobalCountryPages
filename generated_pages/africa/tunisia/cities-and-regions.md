[SECTION] How Tunisia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Tunisia is administratively divided into 24 governorates, each with its own capital and a range of municipalities and delegations. The governorates are further divided into municipalities, which are the basic administrative units in the country. This division allows for a more decentralized approach to governance, enabling local authorities to address specific regional needs and concerns. The administrative structure is overseen by the central government, which is responsible for setting national policies and ensuring the overall development of the country.

The division of Tunisia into governorates is based on geographical, economic, and historical factors. Each governorate has its own unique character, with some being predominantly urban, while others are more rural. The governorates are also home to a range of industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, which contribute to the country's economy. Understanding the administrative structure of Tunisia is essential for anyone looking to explore the country, as it helps to identify the different regions and their characteristics.
