  "content": "The infrastructure in Tunisia is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications, but still faces challenges in terms of rural-urban disparities and aging facilities. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 64%\nRoad Network: 19,997 km, moderate quality with some paved highways\nRail Network: 2,167 km\nMajor Airports: 8\nMajor Ports: 8\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nTunisia has made significant investments in its infrastructure over the past few decades, with a focus on modernizing its transportation networks, expanding its energy generation capacity, and improving its telecommunications systems. However, despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of rural-urban disparities, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's road network, expanding its port facilities, and developing its renewable energy sector. The government has also launched initiatives to improve the business climate and attract foreign investment, which is expected to drive further infrastructure development.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development has been driven by a combination of public and private sector investment, with the government playing a key role in planning and regulating the sector. However, the pace of development has been slow, and the country still faces significant challenges in terms of financing and implementing large-scale infrastructure projects. Despite these challenges, Tunisia has made significant progress in recent years, and its infrastructure is now considered to be among the most developed in the region.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing Tunisia's infrastructure development is the need to balance the requirements of different regions and sectors. The country's rural areas are often poorly served by basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and water, while the urban areas are often congested and lacking in modern amenities. The government has launched initiatives to address these disparities, including programs to upgrade rural roads and expand access to basic services.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 19,997 km | Moderate | Includes some paved highways, but many rural roads are unpaved |\n| Railways | 2,167 km | Good | Includes a mix of freight and passenger lines, with some electrification |\n| Airports | 8 international, 15 domestic | Good | Includes major airports in Tunis, Monastir, and Djerba |\n| Ports | 8 major | Good | Includes major ports in Tunis, Sfax, and Sousse, with facilities for cargo and passenger ships |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Tunisia's power generation is primarily based on **natural gas**, which accounts for around 90% of the country's electricity production.\n- The country has made significant progress in recent years in terms of **renewable energy**, with a focus on developing its solar and wind power sectors.\n- However, the country still faces challenges in terms of **energy security**, with a reliance on imported fuels and a lack of diversification in its energy mix.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve the **reliability** of the power grid, including programs to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n- Tunisia has also made progress in terms of **energy efficiency**, with a focus on promoting the use of energy-efficient appliances and buildings.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but may be contaminated in rural areas.\n- **Sanitation** coverage is relatively high, with around 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- However, **water access** remains a challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional wells and springs.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water management**, including programs to upgrade irrigation systems and promote water conservation.\n- Tunisia has also made progress in terms of **wastewater treatment**, with a focus on developing modern treatment facilities and promoting the use of recycled water.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with around 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic** networks are being developed, with a focus on providing high-speed internet access to urban areas.\n- **4G** services are available in many parts of the country, with **5G** services expected to be launched in the near future.\n- **Postal services** are provided by the state-owned postal company, which offers a range of services including mail delivery and parcel shipping.\n- Tunisia has also made progress in terms of **digital literacy**, with a focus on promoting the use of digital technologies and providing training and education programs.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major **transport infrastructure development program**, which includes plans to upgrade the country's road network, expand its port facilities, and develop its rail network.\n- A new **renewable energy plan** has been launched, which aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix to 30% by 2030.\n- The **Tunis Metro** project is underway, which will provide a modern public transportation system for the capital city.\n- A new **desalination plant** is being developed, which will provide clean water for the city of Tunis and surrounding areas.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to **upgrade its telecommunications infrastructure**, including plans to develop a national fiber-optic network and promote the use of digital technologies.",
