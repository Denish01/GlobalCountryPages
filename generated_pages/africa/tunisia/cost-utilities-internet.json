However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning and water. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the cost of utilities can still vary depending on the provider and usage. Overall, the quality of utility infrastructure in Tunisia is good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water, but the cost can be a challenge for some households.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Tunisia is also affected by the country's economic situation, with prices increasing in recent years due to inflation and currency fluctuations. However, the government has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of these increases on low-income households, such as subsidies for electricity and water. Despite these challenges, the overall quality of utility infrastructure in Tunisia is good, with a high percentage of the population having access to modern amenities.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in municipal tax) |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$140** | **$205** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Tunisie Telecom, Orange |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Tunisie Telecom, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1 GB | Tunisie Telecom, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | Tunisie Telecom, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Tunisie Telecom, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Tunisia's own streaming platform) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Tunisia, it's best to contact the provider directly, such as Tunisie Telecom for internet and phone services, and the local municipal authority for water and electricity.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for households with variable income, as they allow for more control over usage and costs.\n- The best internet providers in Tunisia are Tunisie Telecom and Orange, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transport or carpooling to reduce fuel consumption.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with providers to get the best rates, especially for internet and phone services, where prices can vary depending on the provider and plan.",
