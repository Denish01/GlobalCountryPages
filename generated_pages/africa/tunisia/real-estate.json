The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a strong demand for apartments and villas in urban areas. The price trajectory has been steadily increasing, with a focus on the coastal regions and major cities. Urban areas such as Tunis, Sousse, and Hammamet are the most popular destinations for property buyers, while rural areas offer a more affordable and traditional way of life.\n\nThe current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available at competitive prices. However, the market is also subject to fluctuations in the global economy and regional politics.
