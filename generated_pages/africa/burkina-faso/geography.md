[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso is a landlocked country located in West Africa. It is situated in the heart of the Sahel region, a transitional zone between the Sahara Desert to the north and the savannas to the south. The country is bordered by six countries: Mali to the west and north, Niger to the northeast, Benin to the southeast, Togo and Ghana to the south, and Ivory Coast to the southwest. With no direct access to the sea, Burkina Faso relies on its neighboring countries for trade and commerce.

The country's strategic location in the Sahel region makes it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between the Arab world to the north and the African countries to the south. The climate and geography of the region have also played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture. The Sahara Desert to the north has historically been a barrier to trade and migration, while the savannas to the south have provided fertile land for agriculture and livestock.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso's terrain is characterized by a variety of landscapes, including savannas, forests, and deserts. The country can be divided into three main regions: the Sahel region to the north, the Sudanian region to the south, and the **Guinean** region to the southwest. The Sahel region is a transitional zone between the Sahara Desert and the savannas, with a mix of grasslands and scrublands. The Sudanian region is a vast savanna area with a mix of grasslands and open woodlands. The Guinean region is a forest-savanna mosaic with a mix of forests, woodlands, and grasslands.

The country's landscape is also dotted with several rivers, including the **Black Volta**, **White Volta**, and **Red Volta**, which flow into the **Volta River** basin. The rivers provide water for irrigation, drinking, and fishing, and support a diverse range of aquatic life. The country's highest point, **Ténakourou**, is a hill located in the southwest, while the lowest point is the **Black Volta** river valley.

The country's geology is characterized by a mix of Precambrian rocks, including granite, gneiss, and schist, which provide a rich source of minerals, including gold, copper, and manganese. The country's soil is generally poor in nutrients, but the savannas and forests provide fertile land for agriculture and livestock.
