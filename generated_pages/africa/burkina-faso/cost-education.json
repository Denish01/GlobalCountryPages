  "content": "The cost of education in Burkina Faso varies depending on the type of institution and the level of study, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools and international institutions charge tuition fees ranging from $100 to $5,000 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 5.3%\nLiteracy Rate: 41%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory primary education, followed by 4 years of secondary education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Burkina Faso is divided into public and private institutions, with the public sector being the largest provider of education. However, the quality of public education is often compromised due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure, while private schools generally offer better facilities and more qualified teachers. The language of instruction is **French**, which is the official language of Burkina Faso. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are also available, mainly in the capital city of Ouagadougou, offering a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and the **Cambridge International Examinations**.\n\nThe education system in Burkina Faso faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant efforts to improve the education sector, including increasing the education budget and implementing programs to improve teacher training and student outcomes. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more comprehensive education, with better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a higher cost. International schools cater to the needs of expatriate children and offer a range of curricula, allowing students to pursue their education in a familiar environment.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and inadequate infrastructure |\n| Private Primary | $100-$500 | Range of private schools with varying quality and fees |\n| Public Secondary | $20-$50 (subsidized) | Limited resources and inadequate infrastructure |\n| Private Secondary | $200-$1,000 | Range of private schools with varying quality and fees |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Curriculum types include International Baccalaureate and Cambridge International Examinations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$300 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs and resources |\n| Private University | $500-$1,500 | $1,000-$3,000 | Range of private universities with varying quality and fees |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$4,000 | University of Ouagadougou, offering a range of programs in **French** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$50 | Limited availability and quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Range of tutors with varying qualifications and fees |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | **French** language courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic supplies, including textbooks and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Mandatory for public and private schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **University of Ouagadougou** is the top-ranked university in Burkina Faso, offering a range of programs in **French**.\n- Limited **scholarship** opportunities are available for local and international students, mainly through government and private organizations.\n- **Online learning** options are limited, but some universities offer distance learning programs.\n- Education quality in Burkina Faso is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure.\n- **International schools** are the best option for expatriate children, offering a range of curricula and better facilities.\n- **Private tutoring** is a popular option for students who need extra support, with a range of tutors available at varying fees.",
