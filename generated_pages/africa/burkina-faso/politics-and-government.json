The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and head of government. The President is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is limited to two terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Assembly, which has 127 seats. Members of the National Assembly are elected by proportional representation for five-year terms. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and the Council of State, which are responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly.\n\nThe system of government in Burkina Faso is designed to provide a balance of power among the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Constitution, which also provides for the protection of individual rights and freedoms. The government is **unitary**, meaning that power is centralized in the capital city of Ouagadougou, and the country is divided into 13 regions and 45 provinces for administrative purposes.\n\nThe political system in Burkina Faso has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the country experiencing a period of instability and unrest. In 2014, a popular uprising led to the overthrow of President Blaise Compaoré, who had been in power for 27 years. Since then, the country has been working to establish a more democratic system of government, with a focus on promoting stability, security, and economic development.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Ibrahim Traoré | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Apollinaire Joachim Kyélem de Tambèla | Head of government |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker of the National Assembly | Lawmaking body |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Highest court in the land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| People's Movement for Progress | Center-left | Roch Marc Christian Kaboré | 55 | Former ruling party |\n| Union for Progress and Reform | Center-right | Zéphirin Diabré | 33 | Main opposition party |\n| Alliance for Democracy and Federation | Center-left | Moussa Nagui | 14 | Coalition of smaller parties |\n| Congress for Democracy and Progress | Center-right | Eddie Komboïgo | 18 | Former ruling party |\n| National Rebirth Party | Center-left | Laurent Bado | 5 | Smaller opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Burkina Faso is based on universal suffrage, with all citizens over the age of 18 eligible to vote.\n- Presidential and legislative elections are held every five years, with the most recent elections taking place in 2020.\n- The next elections are scheduled to take place in 2025, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n- Voter participation in Burkina Faso is relatively high, with turnout rates averaging around 60% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Burkina Faso is unstable, with the country experiencing a period of unrest and insecurity.\n- Key issues facing the government include **terrorism**, **poverty**, and **corruption**, which are all major challenges to stability and development.\n- The country is also vulnerable to **regional dynamics**, including the spread of extremist groups from neighboring countries.\n- The government has been working to promote **freedom of speech** and **freedom of assembly**, although there are still restrictions on these rights in practice.\n- The country's **human rights record** is a major concern, with reports of abuses by security forces and other actors.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Burkina Faso is a member of the **United Nations** and the **African Union**, and participates in a number of regional and international organizations.\n- The country has close relationships with **France**, its former colonial power, and other European countries, as well as with **China** and other emerging economies.\n- Burkina Faso is also a member of the **Economic Community of West African States** (ECOWAS), which promotes regional economic integration and cooperation.\n- The country has a **non-aligned** foreign policy, and seeks to maintain good relationships with a wide range of countries and international organizations.\n- Burkina Faso has been working to promote **regional security** and **cooperation**, particularly in the areas of counter-terrorism and border security.",
