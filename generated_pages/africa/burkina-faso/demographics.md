[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso has a relatively large population, with approximately 24 million people, which is expected to continue growing due to a high total fertility rate. The population growth rate is around 3.1%, which is one of the highest in the world. This growth is largely driven by a young population, with a median age of 17 years. The country is experiencing rapid urbanization, with about 34% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Ouagadougou. Migration patterns in Burkina Faso are influenced by economic and environmental factors, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better job opportunities.

The population of Burkina Faso is also affected by regional and international migration trends. Many Burkinabé migrate to neighboring countries, such as Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, in search of work, while others move to Europe or other parts of the world for economic or educational opportunities. The country's population is also influenced by refugee movements, with many people fleeing conflict or persecution in neighboring countries. Despite these challenges, Burkina Faso's population is expected to continue growing, with significant implications for the country's economy, education system, and healthcare infrastructure.

The government of Burkina Faso is working to address the challenges posed by rapid population growth, including investing in family planning programs and improving access to education and healthcare. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including poverty, inequality, and limited access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation. To address these challenges, the government is working to promote economic growth, improve governance, and increase investment in human development.
