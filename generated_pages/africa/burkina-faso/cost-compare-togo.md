[SECTION] Overview: Burkina Faso vs Togo [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso and Togo are two neighboring countries in West Africa, both with unique cultural and economic profiles. In terms of cost of living, Burkina Faso is generally considered to be the more affordable option, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. This is largely due to the country's lower overall GDP per capita and lower inflation rate, which contribute to a more stable and affordable economy. Togo, on the other hand, has a slightly higher cost of living, particularly in the capital city of Lomé, where prices for accommodation and food can be relatively high.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Burkina Faso has a largely agricultural economy, with a strong focus on cotton and gold production, while Togo has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on phosphate mining and manufacturing. This diversification can contribute to higher prices for goods and services in Togo, particularly in the urban areas. Overall, Burkina Faso is generally around 15-20% cheaper than Togo, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.
