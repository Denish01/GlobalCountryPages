# The Truth About Burkina Faso - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso, formerly known as Upper Volta, has a rich and diverse history. The area was first inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the Mossi, Fulani, and Dioula, around the 12th century. In the 19th century, the Mossi Empire was established, which played a significant role in the region's history. The French colonization of the area began in 1896, and it became a French protectorate in 1897. The colony was officially named Upper Volta in 1919. On August 5, 1960, Upper Volta gained its independence from France, with Maurice Yaméogo as its first president. In 1984, the country's name was changed to Burkina Faso, which means "land of honest people" in the Mossi language.

The country's early years of independence were marked by political instability, with several coups and changes in government. In 1983, Thomas Sankara, a Marxist revolutionary, came to power and implemented various reforms, including land redistribution and the promotion of women's rights. However, his rule was short-lived, and he was overthrown and assassinated in 1987. Since then, the country has had several presidents, including Blaise Compaoré, who ruled from 1987 to 2014, and Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, who was elected in 2015.

Burkina Faso has been a member of the United Nations since 1960 and has participated in various international organizations, including the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The country has also been involved in regional conflicts, including the Ivorian Civil War and the Mali War. In recent years, Burkina Faso has faced several security challenges, including terrorist attacks and kidnappings, particularly in the northern regions.

The country's economy has also faced significant challenges, including poverty, corruption, and a lack of infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Burkina Faso has made significant progress in recent years, including the development of its mining sector and the implementation of various social programs. The country has also made efforts to promote democracy and human rights, including the establishment of an independent electoral commission and the promotion of women's participation in politics.
