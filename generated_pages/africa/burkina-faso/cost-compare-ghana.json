Burkina Faso has a smaller economy, with a GDP per capita of around $2,272, compared to Ghana's $7,343. The cost of living in Burkina Faso is generally lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being around 15-20% cheaper than in Ghana. This makes Burkina Faso an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle. However, Ghana's stronger economy and more developed infrastructure may make it a better choice for those prioritizing convenience and amenities.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Burkina Faso's economy is largely based on agriculture, with cotton, gold, and livestock being major exports. Ghana, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on oil and gas production, as well as mining and manufacturing. This diversity has contributed to Ghana's higher GDP per capita and overall standard of living. However, it also means that Ghana has a higher cost of living, particularly in urban areas like Accra. In contrast, Burkina Faso's smaller economy and lower cost of living make it an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 100 | 180 | 44% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 300 | 500 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 8 | 37% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 80 | 120 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 0.80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.50 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Burkina Faso is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices around 40% lower than in Ghana\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries costing around 30-40% less\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices around 20-30% lower\n  - Utilities and internet, with costs around 30-50% cheaper\n- **Ghana is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain imported goods, which may be more widely available and cheaper in Ghana\n  - High-end amenities and services, which may be more readily available in Ghana's larger cities\n  - Travel and tourism, with Ghana's more developed infrastructure and tourist industry making it easier to get around and find accommodation\n  - Business and investment opportunities, with Ghana's stronger economy and more diversified industry base making it a more attractive option for entrepreneurs and investors\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle, Burkina Faso is likely the better choice. The country's lower cost of living, combined with its rich cultural heritage and friendly people, make it an attractive option for those prioritizing affordability and simplicity. However, for those who value convenience, amenities, and economic opportunities, Ghana may be the better choice.
