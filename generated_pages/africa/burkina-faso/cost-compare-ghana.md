[SECTION] Overview: Burkina Faso vs Ghana [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso and Ghana are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with distinct economic and cultural profiles. Burkina Faso has a smaller economy, with a GDP per capita of around $2,272, compared to Ghana's $7,343. The cost of living in Burkina Faso is generally lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being around 15-20% cheaper than in Ghana. This makes Burkina Faso an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle. However, Ghana's stronger economy and more developed infrastructure may make it a better choice for those prioritizing convenience and amenities.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Burkina Faso's economy is largely based on agriculture, with cotton, gold, and livestock being major exports. Ghana, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on oil and gas production, as well as mining and manufacturing. This diversity has contributed to Ghana's higher GDP per capita and overall standard of living. However, it also means that Ghana has a higher cost of living, particularly in urban areas like Accra. In contrast, Burkina Faso's smaller economy and lower cost of living make it an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable lifestyle.
