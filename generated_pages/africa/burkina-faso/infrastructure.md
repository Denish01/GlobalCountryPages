# Burkina Faso Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Burkina Faso is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in access to electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas, but the country has made recent investments to improve its transport and energy sectors.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 34% of population
Internet Penetration: 12%
Road Network: 15,000 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: 622 km
Major Airports: 2
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in West Africa. The country has made efforts to improve its infrastructure in recent years, with investments in the energy and transport sectors. However, the urban-rural gap remains significant, with most infrastructure development concentrated in urban areas such as the capital Ouagadougou. The government has implemented several projects to expand access to electricity, water, and sanitation, but much work remains to be done to address the needs of the rural population.

The country's infrastructure is also affected by its landlocked location, which increases the cost of transporting goods and services. Despite these challenges, Burkina Faso has made progress in recent years, with the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities. The government has also implemented policies to attract private investment in the infrastructure sector, which is expected to drive growth and development in the coming years.

The infrastructure sector in Burkina Faso is also affected by security concerns, particularly in the northern regions of the country. The presence of armed groups and terrorist organizations has disrupted infrastructure development and maintenance, particularly in the areas of transportation and energy. The government is working to address these security concerns and ensure the stability and security of the country's infrastructure.
