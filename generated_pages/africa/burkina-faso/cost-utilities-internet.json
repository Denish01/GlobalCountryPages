  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Burkina Faso can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $50 to $150 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($100 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.20 per kWh)\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Burkina Faso is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has implemented measures to improve the utility infrastructure, but the costs can still be unstable. The inflation rate of 4.2% in 2024 can also impact the cost of utilities, making it essential to budget accordingly.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Burkina Faso varies depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the cost of utilities can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with lower incomes. The GDP per capita PPP of $2,896 in 2024 indicates a relatively low standard of living, making it essential to manage utility costs effectively. The out-of-pocket health spend of 43.8% in 2023 also highlights the need for affordable utility services to ensure a decent standard of living.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | prepaid and postpaid options available |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | metered and flat rate options available |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | mostly used for cooking |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in water bill in some areas |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$85** | **$120** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Onatel, Telecel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Onatel, Telecel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Onatel, Telecel, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Onatel, Telecel, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Onatel, Telecel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | available in some areas with good internet connectivity |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in some areas with good internet connectivity |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | available in some areas with good internet connectivity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as Onatel or Telecel, to inquire about the available options and pricing.\n- Prepaid electricity options are available, but postpaid options may offer more flexibility and better rates for heavy users.\n- The best internet providers in Burkina Faso are Onatel and Telecel, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it is essential to monitor usage and adjust consumption accordingly, such as using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It is also recommended to explore bundled services, such as phone and internet packages, to get better rates and more value for money.",
