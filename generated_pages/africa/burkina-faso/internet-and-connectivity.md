[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Burkina Faso is characterized by a significant urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in major cities such as Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, while rural areas often have limited or no internet access. The average internet speed in Burkina Faso is around 5 Mbps download, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. However, the internet is generally reliable in urban areas, with occasional outages and disruptions, but these are usually quickly resolved.

Despite the challenges, the Burkinabe government has made efforts to improve internet access and quality, particularly in urban areas, with the deployment of 4G networks and the introduction of new internet service providers. However, more needs to be done to address the significant digital divide between urban and rural areas, and to improve the overall quality and reliability of the internet in Burkina Faso. The lack of internet infrastructure in rural areas is a major obstacle to economic development and social progress, and it is essential that the government and private sector invest in expanding internet access to these areas.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Burkina Faso, tourists and travelers can visit the offices of the main mobile carriers, such as Telmob, Onatel, and Orange Burkina Faso, which are usually located in major cities. To purchase a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, and the cost is around 5 USD for a tourist SIM. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as they offer better coverage and quality of service. Data plans are also available, with prices starting from around 1 USD per day for 100 MB of data.

It is also possible to purchase a SIM card from street vendors or small shops, but it is essential to ensure that the SIM card is genuine and not stolen or counterfeit. It is also recommended to check the coverage and quality of the network before purchasing a SIM card, as some carriers may have better coverage in certain areas.
