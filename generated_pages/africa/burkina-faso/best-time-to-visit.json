The dry season, which lasts from December to May, is characterized by cooler temperatures and minimal rainfall. The wet season, which lasts from June to September, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures. The country can be divided into three climate zones: the Sahel region in the north, which is hot and dry; the Sudanian region in the center, which is hot and humid; and the Guinean region in the south, which is hot and wet. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as the wet season can make roads impassable, while the dry season can be ideal for exploring the country's outdoors.\n\nThe dry season is the best time to visit Burkina Faso, as the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for traveling and exploring the country. The temperatures are mild, ranging from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F), and the rainfall is minimal. This season is also the best time to visit the country's national parks and wildlife reserves, as the dry vegetation makes it easier to spot animals.
