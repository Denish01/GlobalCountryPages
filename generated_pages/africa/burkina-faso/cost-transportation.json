The quality of public transit is generally poor, with limited coverage and frequent breakdowns. However, the government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of public transportation services. In the capital city of Ouagadougou, there are several transportation options available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services.\n\nThe majority of the population relies on **walking or cycling** as their primary mode of transportation, especially in rural areas where roads are often unpaved and inaccessible to vehicles. In urban areas, **motorcycles** are also a popular mode of transportation, with many people using them to commute to work or school. The lack of a well-developed public transportation system has led to a thriving **informal transportation sector**, with many private operators offering transportation services to the public.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $10 | Limited coverage, frequent breakdowns |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | Extensive network, but often overcrowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Taxiyam, Allo Taxi available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Not applicable, as there are no toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Depending on route and operator |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, depending on airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **public transportation** or **walking** for short distances.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Taxiyam or Allo Taxi to book taxis in advance and avoid haggling over prices.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a taxi, as prices can vary depending on the driver and the route.\n- Be careful when using **informal transportation modes**, as they may not be regulated or insured.\n- Consider **renting a car** for long-distance travel, as it may be more convenient and cost-effective than taking public transportation.\n- Be aware of **traffic rules and regulations**, as they may be different from what you are used to in your home country.",
