[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Burkina Faso is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and head of government. The President is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is limited to two terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Assembly, which has 127 seats. Members of the National Assembly are elected by proportional representation for five-year terms. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and the Council of State, which are responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly.

The system of government in Burkina Faso is designed to provide a balance of power among the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Constitution, which also provides for the protection of individual rights and freedoms. The government is **unitary**, meaning that power is centralized in the capital city of Ouagadougou, and the country is divided into 13 regions and 45 provinces for administrative purposes.

The political system in Burkina Faso has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the country experiencing a period of instability and unrest. In 2014, a popular uprising led to the overthrow of President Blaise Compaoré, who had been in power for 27 years. Since then, the country has been working to establish a more democratic system of government, with a focus on promoting stability, security, and economic development.
