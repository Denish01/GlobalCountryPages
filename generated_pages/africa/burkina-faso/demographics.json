The population growth rate is around 3.1%, which is one of the highest in the world. This growth is largely driven by a young population, with a median age of 17 years. The country is experiencing rapid urbanization, with about 34% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Ouagadougou. Migration patterns in Burkina Faso are influenced by economic and environmental factors, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better job opportunities.\n\nThe population of Burkina Faso is also affected by regional and international migration trends. Many Burkinabé migrate to neighboring countries, such as Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, in search of work, while others move to Europe or other parts of the world for economic or educational opportunities. The country's population is also influenced by refugee movements, with many people fleeing conflict or persecution in neighboring countries. Despite these challenges, Burkina Faso's population is expected to continue growing, with significant implications for the country's economy, education system, and healthcare infrastructure.\n\nThe government of Burkina Faso is working to address the challenges posed by rapid population growth, including investing in family planning programs and improving access to education and healthcare. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including poverty, inequality, and limited access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation. To address these challenges, the government is working to promote economic growth, improve governance, and increase investment in human development.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mossi | 52% | Central and eastern regions | Dominant ethnic group, with a strong tradition of farming and trade |\n| Fulani | 8.4% | Northern and western regions | Nomadic herders, with a strong tradition of cattle breeding and dairy production |\n| Gourmantché | 7% | Eastern region | Agricultural community, with a strong tradition of farming and fishing |\n| Bobo | 4.9% | Western region | Agricultural community, with a strong tradition of farming and craftsmanship |\n| Dioula | 2.4% | Southern region | Merchants and traders, with a strong tradition of commerce and entrepreneurship |\n| Bissa | 1.4% | Southern region | Agricultural community, with a strong tradition of farming and animal husbandry |\n| Senoufo | 1.2% | Southwest region | Agricultural community, with a strong tradition of farming and craftsmanship |\n[/TABLE]\nBurkina Faso is a multicultural society, with over 60 ethnic groups.
