[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Burkina Faso is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has implemented measures to improve the utility infrastructure, but the costs can still be unstable. The inflation rate of 4.2% in 2024 can also impact the cost of utilities, making it essential to budget accordingly.

The quality of utility services in Burkina Faso varies depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the cost of utilities can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with lower incomes. The GDP per capita PPP of $2,896 in 2024 indicates a relatively low standard of living, making it essential to manage utility costs effectively. The out-of-pocket health spend of 43.8% in 2023 also highlights the need for affordable utility services to ensure a decent standard of living.
