[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **informal transportation modes** such as minibuses and shared taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with limited coverage and frequent breakdowns. However, the government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of public transportation services. In the capital city of Ouagadougou, there are several transportation options available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services.

The majority of the population relies on **walking or cycling** as their primary mode of transportation, especially in rural areas where roads are often unpaved and inaccessible to vehicles. In urban areas, **motorcycles** are also a popular mode of transportation, with many people using them to commute to work or school. The lack of a well-developed public transportation system has led to a thriving **informal transportation sector**, with many private operators offering transportation services to the public.
