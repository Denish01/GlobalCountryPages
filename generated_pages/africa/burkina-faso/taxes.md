[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso has a **territorial taxation** system, where only income earned within the country is subject to tax, regardless of the taxpayer's residency status. However, individuals who are considered **tax residents** are taxed on their worldwide income. To be considered a tax resident, an individual must have a **permanent home** in Burkina Faso, or spend more than **six months** in the country during a calendar year. Tax residency rules are important for individuals and businesses to understand, as they can affect tax liability and compliance requirements.

The tax system in Burkina Faso is administered by the **Direction Générale des Impôts** (DGI), which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services. The DGI also provides guidance on tax compliance and offers support to taxpayers who need help navigating the tax system. Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, so it's essential for taxpayers to stay informed and consult with a qualified tax professional to ensure compliance with all tax requirements.
