  "content": "Healthcare in Burkina Faso is a mixed system, with a combination of public and private providers, but the quality of care and access to facilities can vary significantly depending on the location and type of institution.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: [RATING] 2/5\nEmergency Number: 17\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Burkina Faso is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by health centers and dispensaries, while secondary care is offered by regional hospitals. Tertiary care is available at the national hospital in Ouagadougou, the capital city. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, but private clinics and hospitals are also available, especially in urban areas. The quality of care can be limited, especially in rural areas, due to a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals and a lack of equipment and resources. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare facilities and services, but even in these areas, the quality of care can be inconsistent.\n\nThe public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services in Burkina Faso, but the private sector is growing, especially in urban areas. Private clinics and hospitals often offer better quality care and more specialized services, but they can be expensive and may not be accessible to the majority of the population. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, but more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are some positive developments in the healthcare sector in Burkina Faso. The government has made efforts to increase funding for healthcare and to improve the training and deployment of healthcare professionals. Additionally, international organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are providing support to strengthen the healthcare system and improve access to services, especially in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de
