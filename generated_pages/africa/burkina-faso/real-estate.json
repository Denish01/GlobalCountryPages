The market is influenced by the country's economic growth, driven by the mining and agricultural sectors, as well as its strategic location in West Africa. Currently, the market is experiencing a moderate growth trend, with prices increasing steadily over the past few years. However, the market is still relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region. Urban areas, such as Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, tend to have higher property prices and rental yields compared to rural areas.\n\nThe government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including the creation of a national housing policy and the establishment of a real estate agency to regulate the sector. Additionally, the country has seen an increase in foreign investment, particularly from Chinese and European companies, which has contributed to the growth of the property market. Despite these positive trends, the market still faces challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and limited access to financing.\n\nThe property market in Burkina Faso is also influenced by the country's cultural and social context. For example, the concept of **community land** is still prevalent in many areas, where land is owned collectively by the community rather than individual owners. This can create complexities for foreign investors and developers, who must navigate these traditional land ownership systems.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ouagadougou | 200 | 150 | Apartment |\n| Bobo-Dioulasso | 150 | 100 | House |\n| Koudougou | 100 | 80 | Apartment |\n| Banfora | 80 | 60 | House |\n| Ouahigouya | 60 | 40 | Apartment |\n| Dédougou | 50 | 30 | House |\n| Gaoua | 40 | 20 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Burkina Faso, but they must obtain a **certificate of ownership** from the Ministry of Land and Housing.\n- Foreign companies can also own property, but they must be registered with the **Burkinabe Trade Register**.\n- Foreigners can lease land for up to 99 years, with the option to renew.\n- Foreigners must also obtain a **tax identification number** from the tax authorities to purchase property.\n- Foreigners may be required to obtain a **permit** from the Ministry of Land and Housing to purchase property in certain areas, such as national parks or protected zones.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
