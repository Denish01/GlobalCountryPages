In comparison to neighboring countries, Burkina Faso is more affordable than Ghana or Ivory Coast, but slightly more expensive than Mali or Niger.

The cost of living in Burkina Faso varies depending on the city and lifestyle. Ouagadougou, the capital city, is the most expensive city in the country, with higher prices for rent, food, and transportation.
