[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which lasts from December to May, is characterized by cooler temperatures and minimal rainfall. The wet season, which lasts from June to September, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures. The country can be divided into three climate zones: the Sahel region in the north, which is hot and dry; the Sudanian region in the center, which is hot and humid; and the Guinean region in the south, which is hot and wet. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as the wet season can make roads impassable, while the dry season can be ideal for exploring the country's outdoors.

The dry season is the best time to visit Burkina Faso, as the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for traveling and exploring the country. The temperatures are mild, ranging from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F), and the rainfall is minimal. This season is also the best time to visit the country's national parks and wildlife reserves, as the dry vegetation makes it easier to spot animals. The dry season is also the peak tourist season, with many festivals and events taking place during this time.

However, the wet season can be challenging for travelers, as the heavy rainfall can make roads impassable, and the high temperatures can be uncomfortable. The temperatures during the wet season can range from 25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F), and the rainfall can be intense, with some areas receiving up to 1,000 mm (39 in) of rainfall during this time. Despite the challenges, the wet season can be a good time to visit Burkina Faso for those who are interested in seeing the country's lush vegetation and experiencing the local culture.
