[SECTION] Overview: Burkina Faso vs Niger [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso and Niger are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Burkina Faso has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, while Niger's economy is primarily based on agriculture and livestock. The cost of living in both countries is relatively low compared to other African countries, but Burkina Faso tends to be cheaper overall. The main reason for this is the difference in prices for housing, food, and transportation. On average, rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is around $200-300 per month, while in Niamey, the capital of Niger, it can cost around $300-400 per month.

Burkina Faso has a more stable economy, with a growing manufacturing sector and a relatively high GDP per capita. Niger, on the other hand, is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a GDP per capita of around $1,240. This has resulted in higher prices for basic goods and services in Niger, making it more expensive for expats and tourists. However, both countries offer a unique cultural experience and a chance to explore the rich history and traditions of West Africa. Overall, Burkina Faso is the more affordable option, with a cost of living that is around 10-20% lower than in Niger.
