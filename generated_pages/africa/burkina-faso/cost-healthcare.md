[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso's healthcare system is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, which can result in limited access to quality care, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality care, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it may opt for private care. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the cost of private healthcare services.

The healthcare system in Burkina Faso is also subject to a number of challenges, including a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals, limited access to medical equipment and supplies, and a lack of infrastructure. Despite these challenges, there are a number of initiatives underway to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of new healthcare policies and programs aimed at increasing access to quality care. For example, the government has introduced a national health insurance scheme, which provides coverage for a range of healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications.
