  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Burkina Faso can vary greatly, with public healthcare services being generally more affordable, but often with limited resources and long wait times, while private healthcare services can be more expensive, but offer better quality and more timely care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $72 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 43.8% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 17\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nBurkina Faso's healthcare system is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, which can result in limited access to quality care, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality care, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it may opt for private care. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the cost of private healthcare services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Burkina Faso is also subject to a number of challenges, including a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals, limited access to medical equipment and supplies, and a lack of infrastructure. Despite these challenges, there are a number of initiatives underway to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of new healthcare policies and programs aimed at increasing access to quality care. For example, the government has introduced a national health insurance scheme, which provides coverage for a range of healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and provider |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and provider |\n| Dental Checkup | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Prices vary by procedure and provider |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, and some procedures |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Comprehensive coverage, including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, and procedures, as well as evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be purchased at pharmacies with a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and markets\n- The cost of prescription medications can vary greatly, depending on the type and brand\n- Some common medications, such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers**, can cost between $5-$20\n- Pharmacy services are generally available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- It is recommended that foreigners and expats bring any necessary prescription medications with them, as they may not be available in Burkina Faso\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended that you call the local emergency number, 17, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.
