Burkina Faso has a relatively low GDP per capita and a high poverty rate, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Ivory Coast has a more diversified economy and a higher GDP per capita, resulting in a slightly higher cost of living. The overall cost of living in Burkina Faso is around 15-20% lower than in Ivory Coast, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable destination.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Burkina Faso's economy is largely based on agriculture, with cotton, gold, and livestock being major exports. Ivory Coast, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on services, manufacturing, and agriculture. The difference in economic profiles is reflected in the cost of living, with Burkina Faso being generally cheaper for accommodation, food, and transportation. However, Ivory Coast has a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which may make it more appealing to some visitors.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ivory Coast (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 100 | 180 | 44% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 300 | 500 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ivory Coast (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ivory Coast (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ivory Coast (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Burkina Faso (USD) | Ivory Coast (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,500 | 2,500 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Burkina Faso is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices 40-44% lower than in Ivory Coast\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries 37-50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with transit passes and taxi fares 50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices 37-50% lower\n- **Ivory Coast is cheaper for:**\n- Some imported goods, which may be more readily available and cheaper due to Ivory Coast's larger port and more developed trade networks\n- Certain luxury items, which may be more widely available in Ivory Coast's larger cities\n- High-end dining and entertainment options, which may be more prevalent in Ivory Coast\n- International flights, which may be more frequent and cheaper from Ivory Coast's larger airport\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable destination, Burkina Faso offers a significant advantage in terms of cost of living.
