[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of food items can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Burkina Faso. Supermarkets tend to have higher prices due to the added costs of transportation, storage, and packaging. On the other hand, local markets offer fresher produce at lower prices, making them a popular choice for many locals. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to know how to bargain, as prices are often negotiable. A general rule of thumb is to start with a lower offer and gradually increase it until a mutually agreeable price is reached.

When shopping for groceries, it's best to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets. Supermarkets, on the other hand, are better suited for packaged goods like rice, pasta, and canned foods. The price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with some items being up to 50% cheaper at local markets. For example, a kilogram of tomatoes can cost around $1.00 at a local market, while the same item can cost $2.00 at a supermarket.
