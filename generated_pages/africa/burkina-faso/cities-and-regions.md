[SECTION] How Burkina Faso Is Divided [/SECTION]
Burkina Faso is divided into 13 regions, which are further subdivided into 45 provinces and 301 departments. The regions are Boucle du Mouhoun, Cascades, Centre, Centre-Est, Centre-Nord, Centre-Ouest, Centre-Sud, Est, Hauts-Bassins, Nord, Plateau-Central, Sahel, and Sud-Ouest. Each region has its own unique character and plays a distinct role in the country's economy, culture, and history. The regional divisions are largely based on geographical and cultural factors, with the north being more desert-like and the south being more fertile and densely populated.

The administrative structure of Burkina Faso is designed to facilitate decentralization and local governance, with each region having a significant degree of autonomy in managing its own affairs. The regions are also grouped into four larger zones, which are used for statistical and economic planning purposes. The zones are the Sahel, the North, the Centre, and the South, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges. Understanding the regional divisions of Burkina Faso is essential for navigating the country and appreciating its diverse culture and history.
