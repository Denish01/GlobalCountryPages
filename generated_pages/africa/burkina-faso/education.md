[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Burkina Faso is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory, lasts for six years and is free for all children. Secondary education is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for four years and the second cycle lasts for three years. Tertiary education is offered at universities and other institutions, with the University of Ouagadougou being the largest and most prestigious. The quality of education in Burkina Faso is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure and qualified teachers. Public schools are generally overcrowded and underfunded, while private schools are often expensive and inaccessible to many students.

The education system in Burkina Faso faces many challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education sector, including the introduction of free primary education and the construction of new schools. However, much work remains to be done to ensure that all children in Burkina Faso have access to quality education.

The private education sector in Burkina Faso is growing, with many private schools and universities offering a range of programs. These institutions are often expensive, but they offer a higher quality of education and better facilities than public schools. Some private schools also offer bilingual programs, where students can study in both French and English.
