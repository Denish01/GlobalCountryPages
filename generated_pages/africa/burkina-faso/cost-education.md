[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Burkina Faso is divided into public and private institutions, with the public sector being the largest provider of education. However, the quality of public education is often compromised due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure, while private schools generally offer better facilities and more qualified teachers. The language of instruction is **French**, which is the official language of Burkina Faso. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are also available, mainly in the capital city of Ouagadougou, offering a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and the **Cambridge International Examinations**.

The education system in Burkina Faso faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant efforts to improve the education sector, including increasing the education budget and implementing programs to improve teacher training and student outcomes. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more comprehensive education, with better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a higher cost. International schools cater to the needs of expatriate children and offer a range of curricula, allowing students to pursue their education in a familiar environment.
