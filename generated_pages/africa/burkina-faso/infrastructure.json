  "content": "The infrastructure in Burkina Faso is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in access to electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas, but the country has made recent investments to improve its transport and energy sectors.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 34% of population\nInternet Penetration: 12%\nRoad Network: 15,000 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: 622 km\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 0, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nBurkina Faso's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in West Africa. The country has made efforts to improve its infrastructure in recent years, with investments in the energy and transport sectors. However, the urban-rural gap remains significant, with most infrastructure development concentrated in urban areas such as the capital Ouagadougou. The government has implemented several projects to expand access to electricity, water, and sanitation, but much work remains to be done to address the needs of the rural population.\n\nThe country's infrastructure is also affected by its landlocked location, which increases the cost of transporting goods and services. Despite these challenges, Burkina Faso has made progress in recent years, with the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities. The government has also implemented policies to attract private investment in the infrastructure sector, which is expected to drive growth and development in the coming years.\n\nThe infrastructure sector in Burkina Faso is also affected by security concerns, particularly in the northern regions of the country. The presence of armed groups and terrorist organizations has disrupted infrastructure development and maintenance, particularly in the areas of transportation and energy. The government is working to address these security concerns and ensure the stability and security of the country's infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 15,000 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved, with many roads in disrepair |\n| Railways | 622 km | Moderate | Connects Ouagadougou to the port city of Abidjan in Ivory Coast |\n| Airports | 2 international, 7 domestic | Good | Ouagadougou International Airport is the main hub |\n| Ports | 0 | N/A | Landlocked, relies on neighboring countries for access to sea ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of power generation is **thermal energy**, with a total installed capacity of 200 MW.\n- The country has made progress in increasing access to electricity, with a focus on **renewable energy** sources such as solar and wind power.\n- However, the electricity grid is still unreliable, with frequent **power outages** and disruptions to service.\n- The government has implemented a plan to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, with a target of 20% by 2025.\n- The **rural electrification** program aims to expand access to electricity to rural areas, with a focus on off-grid solutions such as solar home systems.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **tap water** is limited, particularly in rural areas, where many people rely on traditional wells and water sources.\n- The **sanitation** coverage is also low, with many households lacking access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- The government has implemented a plan to increase access to **water and sanitation**, with a focus on rural areas and vulnerable populations.\n- The **water treatment** infrastructure is limited, and many people rely on traditional methods such as boiling and filtration to purify water.\n- The country has made progress in increasing access to **hygiene and sanitation** facilities, particularly in schools and healthcare facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- The **mobile phone** coverage is widespread, with most of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- The **internet penetration** is low, but increasing, with a focus on expanding access to broadband and fiber-optic services.\n- The government has implemented a plan to increase access to **information and communication technologies**, with a focus on rural areas and vulnerable populations.\n- The **postal services** are limited, with many people relying on private courier services to send and receive mail and packages.\n- The country has made progress in increasing access to **digital financial services**, particularly mobile money and online banking.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a **transport infrastructure development project**, which aims to improve the road network and expand access to transportation services.\n- The **energy sector development project** aims to increase access to electricity, with a focus on renewable energy sources and off-grid solutions.\n- The **water and sanitation development project** aims to increase access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities, particularly in rural areas.\n- The **telecommunications development project** aims to increase access to information and communication technologies, with a focus on expanding broadband and fiber-optic services.\n- The **urban development project** aims to improve the infrastructure and services in urban areas, with a focus on transportation, water, and sanitation.",
