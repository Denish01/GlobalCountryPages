[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Zambia is divided into public and private schools, with the public sector offering free or subsidized education to all citizens. However, the quality of public education can vary greatly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer higher quality education but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary school. International schools are also available, catering to expatriate children and offering curricula such as the British or American system.

The Zambian government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing new curricula. However, challenges such as limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers remain. Despite these challenges, Zambia has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with enrollment rates increasing significantly over the past decade. Private schools, including international schools, offer a range of curricula and teaching methods, and are often preferred by expatriate families and wealthy Zambians.
