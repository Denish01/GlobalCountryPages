  "content": "Healthcare in Zambia is a mixed system that faces challenges in providing quality care to its population, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 991\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Zambian healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of public, private, and traditional sectors. The public sector is the main provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. The private sector, on the other hand, is relatively well-developed, with several high-quality hospitals and clinics, particularly in urban areas. Despite these efforts, the overall quality of care in Zambia is still below international standards.\n\nThe quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better access to healthcare services and more qualified healthcare professionals. Rural areas, which account for the majority of the population, face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services, with many communities relying on traditional healers and unqualified healthcare providers. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the deployment of community health workers to rural areas.\n\nThe Zambian government has also made efforts to strengthen the healthcare system, including the development of a national health strategy and the establishment of a health ministry. However, the healthcare system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, Zambia has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes, particularly in the areas of maternal and child health, and the control of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| University Teaching Hospital | Lusaka | Public | General, specialist services | Yes |\n| Lusaka Trust Hospital | Lusaka | Private | General, specialist services | Yes |\n| Mwandi Mission Hospital | Mwandi | Private | General, maternity | Limited |\n| Kitwe Central Hospital | Kitwe | Public | General, specialist services | Yes |\n| Livingstone General Hospital | Livingstone | Public | General, specialist services | Yes |\n| Mediross Hospital | Lusaka | Private | General, specialist services | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and locals who can afford it, as it provides access to better quality care and a wider range of services.\n- **National Health Insurance Scheme** is a government-run scheme that provides coverage for citizens, but the quality of care and range of services are limited.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but the quality and range of services vary significantly between providers.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** is recommended for foreigners, as it provides access to better quality care and a wider range of services, including evacuation and repatriation services.\n- **Costs** vary significantly depending on the provider and the level of coverage, but private health insurance can be expensive, with premiums ranging from $500 to $5,000 per year.\n- **Group insurance** is also available for companies and organizations, providing coverage for employees and their dependents.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Availability of medications** is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional healers and unqualified healthcare providers.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication and the provider, but generally, a prescription is required for most medications.\n- **Common brands** include international pharmaceutical companies, as well as local manufacturers.\n- **Costs** vary significantly depending on the medication and the provider, but generally, medications are more expensive in private pharmacies than in public ones.\n- **Quality control** is a significant concern, particularly in rural areas, where many medications are counterfeit or of poor quality.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include yellow fever, hepatitis A, and typhoid, depending on the traveler's country of origin and destination.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis B, rabies, and meningitis, depending on the traveler's activities and duration of stay.\n- **Endemic diseases** include malaria, cholera, and typhoid, which are prevalent in many parts of the country.\n- **Water safety** is a significant concern, particularly in rural areas, where many communities rely on untreated water sources.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, particularly in informal markets and street food stalls, where food handling and preparation practices may be poor.\n- **HIV/AIDS** is a significant public health concern, with a high prevalence rate in many parts of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** include dental care, cosmetic surgery, and orthopedic surgery, which are available in several private hospitals and clinics in Lusaka and other major cities.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the University Teaching Hospital and the Lusaka Trust Hospital, which have international accreditation and provide high-quality care.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, particularly for procedures that are not covered by insurance or are expensive in the traveler's home country.\n- **Language** is generally not a barrier, as many healthcare professionals speak English, particularly in private hospitals and clinics.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **What to do in an emergency** is to call the emergency number, 991, or go to the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is limited, particularly in rural areas, where many communities rely on private transport or traditional healers.\n- **Nearest hospitals** vary depending on the location, but generally, there is a hospital or clinic within a few hours' drive.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, particularly for foreigners, who may need to provide documentation and proof of insurance coverage.\n- **Emergency evacuation** may be necessary, particularly for serious medical conditions or injuries, and can be arranged through private insurance providers or medical evacuation companies.",
