  "content": "Zambia's culture is a rich and diverse blend of traditional and modern influences, shaped by its history, geography, and over 70 ethnic groups, making it a unique and fascinating country to visit.\n\n[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]\nZambia's cultural identity is defined by its diverse ethnic and linguistic makeup, with over 70 ethnic groups, including the Bemba, Tonga, and Lozi, each with their own language and customs. The country's strategic location in southern Africa has also made it a crossroads for various cultural influences, including European, Asian, and African traditions. English is the official language, but many local languages, such as Bemba and Nyanja, are also widely spoken. The country's cultural heritage is also reflected in its traditional music, dance, and art, which are an integral part of Zambian life.\n\nThe cultural identity of Zambia is also shaped by its history, with the country having been a British colony from the early 20th century until independence in 1964. This legacy is still evident in the country's language, education system, and architecture. However, traditional Zambian culture has also been preserved and continues to play an important role in the country's identity. The country's many ethnic groups have managed to maintain their unique customs and traditions, despite the influence of modernity and urbanization.\n\nZambia's cultural diversity is also reflected in its many traditional ceremonies and festivals, which are an important part of the country's heritage. These events are often colorful and vibrant, with traditional music, dance, and costumes on display. Visitors to Zambia can experience the country's rich cultural diversity by attending one of these festivals or by visiting a traditional village.\n\n[SECTION] Food & Cuisine [/SECTION]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Must-Try? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nshima | Staple | A thick cornmeal porridge, often served with vegetables or meat | Yes |\n| Kapenta | Snack | Small, dried fish, often served with nshima or as a snack | Yes |\n| Injera | Bread | A sourdough flatbread, often served with stews or salads | Yes |\n| Mopani worms | Snack | Fried or boiled caterpillars, often served as a snack | No |\n| Chikanda | Snack | A traditional snack made from roasted peanuts and cassava flour | Yes |\n| Vitumbua | Dessert | Fried doughnuts, often served with a sweet or savory filling | Yes |\n| Kachasu | Drink | A traditional beer made from maize or cassava | No |\n| Maheu | Drink | A sweet, fermented drink made from maize or sorghum | Yes |\n\nEating customs and food culture in Zambia are centered around traditional dishes, such as nshima, which is a staple food in many Zambian households.
