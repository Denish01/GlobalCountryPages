[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia's population size is relatively small compared to other African countries, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 2.9%, which is slightly higher than the global average. The country's population is relatively young, with a median age of 17.4 years, and the urban population accounts for about 44% of the total population. The population density is relatively low, with an average of 27.5 people per square kilometer. Zambia's population is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that it will reach 30 million by 2030.

The country's population growth is driven by a combination of factors, including high fertility rates and declining mortality rates. However, the population growth also poses significant challenges, including pressure on limited resources, infrastructure, and social services. Urbanization is also a significant trend in Zambia, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. The capital city, Lusaka, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 1.7 million people.

Zambia's population is also characterized by significant migration patterns, both within and outside the country. Many Zambians migrate to neighboring countries, such as South Africa and Botswana, in search of work, while others move to urban areas within the country. The country is also a recipient of refugees and asylum seekers from neighboring countries, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo.
