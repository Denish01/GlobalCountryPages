[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare services. It is highly recommended to have health insurance in Zambia, as medical costs can be high and unexpected expenses can be financially devastating.

The healthcare system in Zambia is also affected by the country's limited resources and infrastructure. Many healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas, lack basic equipment and supplies, and healthcare workers often have limited training and expertise. Additionally, the country faces a significant shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in specialized fields. As a result, patients often have to travel long distances to access quality healthcare services, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
