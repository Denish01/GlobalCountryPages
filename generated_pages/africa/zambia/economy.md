[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia is a sovereign country located in southern Africa, with a diverse economy that has undergone significant transformations since its independence in 1964. The country has a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $1,143, and an unemployment rate of approximately 12%. Zambia's economic classification is lower-middle, indicating a developing economy with a mix of traditional and modern sectors. The country's development level is also characterized by a growing service sector, which accounts for the largest share of the economy. Zambia's economic trajectory has been shaped by its natural resource endowment, particularly copper, which has been a major driver of the economy for decades.

Despite the dominance of copper, Zambia has been working to diversify its economy, with a focus on agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote economic growth and development, including investment in infrastructure, trade facilitation, and business environment reforms. Zambia's economy has also been impacted by external factors, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and climate change, which have affected the country's agricultural sector. The country's economic growth has been moderate, with an average annual growth rate of around 3-4% over the past decade.

The Zambian government has recognized the need to accelerate economic growth and development, and has set out a vision to become a middle-income country by 2030. To achieve this goal, the government has identified key priority areas, including economic diversification, job creation, and poverty reduction. The government has also emphasized the importance of private sector development, and has implemented various initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and investment. These efforts aim to create a more diversified and resilient economy, with a stronger focus on value addition and export-oriented industries.
