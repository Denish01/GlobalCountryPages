[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia is a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $1,143. The country has a relatively high level of economic development compared to its regional peers, with a strong focus on copper mining and agriculture. However, the economy is also heavily reliant on these two sectors, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. In recent years, the government has implemented policies aimed at diversifying the economy and promoting private sector development, including the creation of special economic zones and the introduction of tax incentives for foreign investors.

The Zambian economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including high copper prices, increased investment in the mining sector, and a growing services sector. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including high levels of poverty and unemployment, particularly among young people. The government has identified key sectors for growth and development, including agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing, and is working to create a more favorable business environment through reforms such as simplifying regulatory procedures and improving access to finance.

Despite these challenges, Zambia has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average rate of around 4-5% per year. The country has also made significant strides in reducing poverty, with the proportion of the population living below the poverty line declining from around 60% in the early 2000s to around 40% today. However, much work remains to be done, and the government will need to continue to implement policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing poverty if it is to achieve its development goals.

However, the country will need to continue to implement policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, including investing in infrastructure, improving the business environment, and promoting private sector development. The government has identified key sectors for growth and development, including agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing, and is working to create a more favorable business environment through reforms such as simplifying regulatory procedures and improving access to finance.

However, the country has a number of major projects and reforms in the pipeline, including the development of a new copper mine in the North-Western Province, and the introduction of a new mining tax regime. The government is also working to promote economic diversification, including through the development of special economic zones and the introduction of tax incentives for foreign investors. Overall, while there are challenges ahead, the Zambian economy has significant potential for growth and development, and is expected to continue to play an important role in the regional economy.
