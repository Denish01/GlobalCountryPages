[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Zambia is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is both the head of state and head of government. The president is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to two terms. The president appoints a vice president and a cabinet of ministers to assist in the administration of the country. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Assembly, which has 156 seats. Members of the National Assembly are elected by the people for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court, among others. The judiciary is independent and impartial, and its main function is to interpret the laws of the land.

The Zambian government is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the three branches. The executive branch is responsible for the administration of the country, while the legislative branch is responsible for making laws. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are applied fairly and justly. Zambia is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and no regional or state governments. This means that the central government has the power to make decisions for the entire country, without any regional or state governments having significant autonomy.

The Zambian political system is also characterized by a **multi-party system**, with several political parties competing for power. This has led to a vibrant and competitive political environment, with parties and politicians actively engaging with the electorate and competing for votes. However, the multi-party system has also led to some challenges, including political instability and conflict between parties.
