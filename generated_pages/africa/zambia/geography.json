The country's location in the center of southern Africa makes it a key player in regional trade and commerce. Zambia's borders are largely defined by natural features such as rivers and mountains, which have played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture.\n\nThe country's location in the tropics means that it experiences a warm climate year-round, with temperatures varying depending on the season and elevation. Zambia is also a landlocked country, which can make it more challenging to access the global market, but it also provides opportunities for the country to develop its own unique culture and economy. The Zambezi River, which forms part of Zambia's southern border, is a significant waterway that supports a wide range of aquatic life and provides hydroelectric power to the country.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nZambia's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, plateaus, and valleys, with the highest point being Mafinga Central, which is located in the northeastern part of the country. The country's landscape is dominated by the **Zambezi River**, which flows through the southern part of Zambia and supports a wide range of wildlife and vegetation. The river is also home to the famous **Victoria Falls**, one of the world's largest waterfalls, which is a major tourist attraction in the region. The falls are over a mile wide and drop over 350 feet into the gorge below, creating a mist that can be seen from miles away.\n\nThe country's mountainous regions are home to a variety of flora and fauna, including **miombo woodlands**, which are found in the eastern part of Zambia, and **montane forests**, which are found in the highest elevations. The woodlands are characterized by dense forests of trees such as **brachystegia** and **julbernardia**, while the montane forests are home to a variety of plant species, including **orchids** and **ferns**. Zambia's valleys and plateaus are also home to a wide range of wildlife, including **lions**, **leopards**, and **elephants**, which can be found in the country's many national parks and game reserves.\n\nThe country's landscape has been shaped by millions of years of erosion and weathering, which has created a diverse range of landforms, including **inselbergs**, which are isolated hills or mountains that rise above the surrounding landscape, and **dambos**, which are shallow valleys or depressions that are often filled with water. The inselbergs are home to a variety of unique plant species, while the dambos are important habitats for a wide range of aquatic life.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Summer | October to March | 20-30°C | High | Hot and humid, with frequent thunderstorms |\n| Autumn | April to May | 15-25°C | Moderate | Mild and pleasant, with fewer thunderstorms |\n| Winter | June to August | 10-20°C | Low | Cool and dry, with clear skies |\n| Spring | September to November | 15-25°C | Moderate | Mild and pleasant, with increasing temperatures |\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: May to October.
