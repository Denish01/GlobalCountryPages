Zambia has a more stable economy, driven by its rich natural resources, including copper, cobalt, and gold. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, has faced significant economic challenges in recent years, including hyperinflation and a decline in its manufacturing sector. As a result, Zambia tends to be more expensive in terms of luxury goods and services, while Zimbabwe is generally cheaper for basic necessities.\n\nThe cost of living in Zambia is around 15-20% lower than in Zimbabwe, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.
