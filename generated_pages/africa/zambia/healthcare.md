[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Zambian healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of public, private, and traditional sectors. The public sector is the main provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. The private sector, on the other hand, is relatively well-developed, with several high-quality hospitals and clinics, particularly in urban areas. Despite these efforts, the overall quality of care in Zambia is still below international standards.

The quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better access to healthcare services and more qualified healthcare professionals. Rural areas, which account for the majority of the population, face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services, with many communities relying on traditional healers and unqualified healthcare providers. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the deployment of community health workers to rural areas.

The Zambian government has also made efforts to strengthen the healthcare system, including the development of a national health strategy and the establishment of a health ministry. However, the healthcare system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, Zambia has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes, particularly in the areas of maternal and child health, and the control of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.
