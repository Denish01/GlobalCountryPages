[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia has a diverse linguistic landscape, with over 70 languages spoken across the country. While English is the official language and widely used in business, education, and government, many Zambians also speak one or more local languages. Nyanja, also known as Chewa, is the most widely spoken language, particularly in the eastern and southern regions, while Bemba is widely spoken in the northern and central regions. Tonga is another major language, spoken in the southern region. Despite the diversity of languages, English is widely understood, particularly among the educated population and those in the tourism industry.

The linguistic diversity of Zambia is also reflected in the country's regional dialects. For example, the dialect of English spoken in Zambia has a distinct accent and vocabulary, with many words borrowed from local languages. Additionally, there are many minority languages spoken in Zambia, including languages of the indigenous **Khoisan** people, who are found in the western and southern regions of the country. These languages are an important part of Zambia's cultural heritage, but are also considered endangered, as many young people are shifting to more widely spoken languages such as English and Nyanja.

Overall, while English is widely understood in Zambia, it is still a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in the local languages, particularly when traveling to rural areas or interacting with local communities. This can help to break the ice and show respect for the local culture, and can also be a useful tool for navigating everyday situations, such as shopping and eating.
