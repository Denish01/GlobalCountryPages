# Zambia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Zambia is developing, with significant investments in recent years, but still faces challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation remains limited.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 31% of population
Internet Penetration: 21%
Road Network: 40,454 km, with 8,881 km paved
Rail Network: 2,157 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Despite recent investments, the country still faces significant gaps in access to basic services, particularly in rural areas. The government has been working to improve the situation, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation, as well as upgrading the country's transport network. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to even the most basic services. The government has also been working to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, with a number of public-private partnerships (PPPs) underway.

The Zambian government has also been investing in the development of new infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities. For example, the government has been working on the construction of a new international airport in Lusaka, as well as the upgrading of the country's rail network. These investments are expected to have a significant impact on the country's economic development, by improving access to markets and reducing the cost of doing business. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding and a shortage of skilled personnel.

The government has also been working to improve the business environment, by streamlining regulatory procedures and reducing bureaucracy. This has helped to attract new investment to the country, particularly in the mining and agriculture sectors. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and a shortage of skilled personnel. The government has also been working to promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are seen as key to driving economic growth and job creation.

| Roads | 40,454 km | Moderate | 8,881 km paved, 31,573 km unpaved |
| Railways | 2,157 km | Poor | Limited freight and passenger services |
| Airports | 4 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, but limited connectivity |
| Ports | 0, landlocked | N/A | Relies on neighboring countries for access to sea ports |
[/TABLE]

The transport network in Zambia is relatively underdeveloped, with a lack of paved roads and limited access to rail and air services. However, the government has been working to upgrade the country's transport infrastructure, with a focus on improving the quality of the road network and increasing access to air and rail services. The country's rail network is limited, with only a few lines operating, and the road network is dominated by unpaved roads. However, the government has been working to upgrade the road network, with a number of new roads and bridges under construction.
