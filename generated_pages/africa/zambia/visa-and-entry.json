[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nZambia has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from over 40 countries eligible for visa-free access or visas on arrival. The country aims to balance security concerns with the need to promote tourism and economic development. Citizens from countries that do not have visa-free access or visas on arrival will need to apply for a visa at a Zambian embassy or consulate before traveling. Zambia's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel while ensuring the safety and security of its citizens and visitors.\n\nThe Zambian government has introduced an e-visa system to simplify the application process for tourists and business travelers. The e-visa system allows applicants to submit their applications online and receive their visas via email. This system has reduced the processing time and made it easier for travelers to plan their trips to Zambia.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for visa at embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for visa at embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a single-entry or multiple-entry visa, with a maximum stay of 90 days.
