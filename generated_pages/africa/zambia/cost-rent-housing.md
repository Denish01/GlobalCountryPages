[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia's rental market is relatively developed, with a mix of modern apartments and traditional houses available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Rent Act, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Zambia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with cities like Lusaka and Kitwe offering a range of affordable options. However, the housing market is subject to fluctuations in the economy, and rent prices can increase significantly in response to inflation.

The Zambian government has implemented policies to increase access to affordable housing, including the development of new housing estates and the provision of subsidies for low-income households. Despite these efforts, the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, remains high, and the supply of affordable housing is limited. As a result, rent prices can be relatively high, especially in desirable neighborhoods. Expats and foreigners may find that they need to budget accordingly, taking into account the costs of utilities, furniture, and other expenses when renting a property in Zambia.
