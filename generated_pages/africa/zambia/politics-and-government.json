The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is both the head of state and head of government. The president is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to two terms. The president appoints a vice president and a cabinet of ministers to assist in the administration of the country. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Assembly, which has 156 seats. Members of the National Assembly are elected by the people for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court, among others. The judiciary is independent and impartial, and its main function is to interpret the laws of the land.\n\nThe Zambian government is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the three branches. The executive branch is responsible for the administration of the country, while the legislative branch is responsible for making laws. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are applied fairly and justly. Zambia is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and no regional or state governments. This means that the central government has the power to make decisions for the entire country, without any regional or state governments having significant autonomy.\n\nThe Zambian political system is also characterized by a **multi-party system**, with several political parties competing for power. This has led to a vibrant and competitive political environment, with parties and politicians actively engaging with the electorate and competing for votes. However, the multi-party system has also led to some challenges, including political instability and conflict between parties.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President Hakainde Hichilema | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Cabinet | Vice President Mutale Nalumango | Advisory body to the president |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker of the National Assembly, Nelly Mutti | Lawmaking body |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice, Mumba Malila | Highest court in the land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United Party for National Development (UPND) | Center-left | Hakainde Hichilema | 82 | Current ruling party |\n| Patriotic Front (PF) | Center-right | Edgar Lungu | 44 | Former ruling party |\n| Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) | Center | Nevers Mumba | 5 | Former ruling party |\n| Forum for Democracy and Development (FDD) | Center-left | Edith Nawakwi | 1 | Opposition party |\n| National Democratic Congress (NDC) | Center-left | Chishimba Kambwili | 1 | Opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Zambia is based on a **first-past-the-post** system, where the candidate with the most votes wins the seat.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent presidential and parliamentary elections held in 2021.\n- The last election saw a significant turnout, with over 70% of registered voters participating.\n- The next election is scheduled for 2026, with the electoral commission already making preparations for the polls.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Zambia has experienced **periods of political instability**, including a disputed election in 2016 and a presidential by-election in 2015.\n- The country faces significant **development challenges**, including high levels of poverty and unemployment, as well as a struggling economy.\n- The government has been working to **improve the business environment**, including reducing bureaucracy and increasing investment in key sectors such as agriculture and mining.\n- Zambia has a **complex regional dynamics**, with the country playing a key role in regional organizations such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).\n- The country has a **mixed record on freedom indices**, with Zambia ranking 86th out of 180 countries in the 2022 World Press Freedom Index, and 92nd out of 180 countries in the 2022 Human Freedom Index.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Zambia is a **member of the United Nations** and has played an active role in international organizations, including the African Union and the SADC.\n- The country has **strong relations with neighboring countries**, including a long-standing alliance with Tanzania and a growing relationship with China.\n- Zambia has also **diversified its economy**, with a growing focus on trade with countries such as the United States, the European Union, and India.\n- The country has **significant diplomatic ties** with countries such as the United Kingdom, which has provided significant development assistance to Zambia over the years.\n- Zambia has also **engaged with international organizations**, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to support its economic development and reform efforts.",
