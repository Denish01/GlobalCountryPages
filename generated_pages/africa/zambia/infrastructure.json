  "content": "The infrastructure in Zambia is developing, with significant investments in recent years, but still faces challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation remains limited.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 31% of population\nInternet Penetration: 21%\nRoad Network: 40,454 km, with 8,881 km paved\nRail Network: 2,157 km\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 0, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nZambia's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Despite recent investments, the country still faces significant gaps in access to basic services, particularly in rural areas. The government has been working to improve the situation, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation, as well as upgrading the country's transport network. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to even the most basic services. The government has also been working to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, with a number of public-private partnerships (PPPs) underway.\n\nThe Zambian government has also been investing in the development of new infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities. For example, the government has been working on the construction of a new international airport in Lusaka, as well as the upgrading of the country's rail network. These investments are expected to have a significant impact on the country's economic development, by improving access to markets and reducing the cost of doing business. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding and a shortage of skilled personnel.\n\nThe government has also been working to improve the business environment, by streamlining regulatory procedures and reducing bureaucracy. This has helped to attract new investment to the country, particularly in the mining and agriculture sectors. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and a shortage of skilled personnel. The government has also been working to promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are seen as key to driving economic growth and job creation.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 40,454 km | Moderate | 8,881 km paved, 31,573 km unpaved |\n| Railways | 2,157 km | Poor | Limited freight and passenger services |\n| Airports | 4 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, but limited connectivity |\n| Ports | 0, landlocked | N/A | Relies on neighboring countries for access to sea ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\nThe transport network in Zambia is relatively underdeveloped, with a lack of paved roads and limited access to rail and air services. However, the government has been working to upgrade the country's transport infrastructure, with a focus on improving the quality of the road network and increasing access to air and rail services. The country's rail network is limited, with only a few lines operating, and the road network is dominated by unpaved roads. However, the government has been working to upgrade the road network, with a number of new roads and bridges under construction.\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of power generation in Zambia is **hydroelectricity**, with the Kariba Dam being the largest power station in the country.\n- The country's power grid is relatively unreliable, with frequent **outages** and **load shedding**.\n- The government has been working to increase access to electricity, with a focus on rural areas, where only 4% of the population has access to electricity.\n- Renewable energy sources, such as **solar** and **wind**, are becoming increasingly important, with a number of new projects underway.\n- The government has set a target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix to 20% by 2030.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **tap water** is limited, with only 43% of the population having access to piped water.\n- The quality of tap water is also a concern, with many people relying on **unimproved sources**, such as wells and rivers.\n- **Sanitation** coverage is also limited, with only 27% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- The government has been working to increase access to water and sanitation, with a focus on rural areas, where access to these services is particularly limited.\n- The country has made significant progress in reducing the number of people without access to improved water sources, but more work is needed to achieve universal access.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread, with over 80% of the population having access to mobile services.\n- **Fiber optic** connectivity is limited, but is becoming increasingly important, with a number of new projects underway.\n- The government has been working to increase access to **broadband** services, with a focus on rural areas, where access to these services is particularly limited.\n- **4G** services are available in major urban areas, but **5G** services are not yet available.\n- The country has a relatively well-developed **postal service**, with a number of post offices throughout the country.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has been working on a number of major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of a new **international airport** in Lusaka.\n- The **Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway** project is also underway, which will improve access to the country's main economic centers.\n- The government has also been working on the development of a new **railway line**, which will connect the country to the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.\n- The **Kariba North Bank power station** project is also underway, which will increase the country's power generation capacity.\n- The government has also been working on the development of a number of new **water and sanitation** projects, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sewage systems.",
