[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Zambia has been steadily improving over the years, with a growing number of internet service providers and increasing mobile network coverage. However, there is still a significant urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in cities like Lusaka and Livingstone, while rural areas often struggle with slower speeds and less reliable connections. The overall internet quality is moderate, with an average download speed of 10 Mbps, which is sufficient for basic browsing, email, and social media, but may not be ideal for heavy streaming or online gaming.

Despite the challenges, the Zambian government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the rollout of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks. As a result, internet reliability has improved, with fewer outages and disruptions reported in recent years. However, during peak hours or in areas with high demand, internet speeds can still be affected, and users may experience slower connections. Overall, while there is room for improvement, the internet in Zambia is generally reliable and suitable for most users' needs.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Zambia, you can visit any of the main carriers' stores or authorized dealers, which are widely available in urban areas. You will need to provide a valid passport and pay the required fee, which is approximately 10 USD for a tourist SIM. The recommended carriers for tourists are MTN Zambia, Airtel Zambia, and Zamtel, which offer a range of prepaid and postpaid plans, including data-only packages. Data plans are generally affordable, with prices starting from around 5 USD for 1 GB of data.

When purchasing a SIM card, it's essential to ensure that your phone is compatible with the local network frequencies and that you understand the terms and conditions of your chosen plan. You may also want to consider purchasing a SIM card with a data package that includes voice and SMS services, as these can be useful for communicating with locals and other travelers.
