  "content": "Zambia's economy is driven by a mix of agriculture, mining, and services, with a growing focus on diversification and private sector development. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($23 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($1,143 estimate)\nIncome Classification: Lower-Middle\nMain Industries: copper mining, agriculture, manufacturing\nCurrency: ZMW\nUnemployment Rate: (approximately 12%)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 85 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nZambia is a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $1,143. The country has a relatively high level of economic development compared to its regional peers, with a strong focus on copper mining and agriculture. However, the economy is also heavily reliant on these two sectors, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. In recent years, the government has implemented policies aimed at diversifying the economy and promoting private sector development, including the creation of special economic zones and the introduction of tax incentives for foreign investors.\n\nThe Zambian economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including high copper prices, increased investment in the mining sector, and a growing services sector. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including high levels of poverty and unemployment, particularly among young people. The government has identified key sectors for growth and development, including agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing, and is working to create a more favorable business environment through reforms such as simplifying regulatory procedures and improving access to finance.\n\nDespite these challenges, Zambia has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average rate of around 4-5% per year. The country has also made significant strides in reducing poverty, with the proportion of the population living below the poverty line declining from around 60% in the early 2000s to around 40% today. However, much work remains to be done, and the government will need to continue to implement policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing poverty if it is to achieve its development goals.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Copper Mining | 10% of GDP | Zambia is one of the largest copper producers in Africa, with major mines located in the Copperbelt Province |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | The agricultural sector is a significant contributor to the Zambian economy, with major crops including maize, soybeans, and tobacco |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is relatively small, but is growing, with a focus on food processing, textiles, and construction materials |\n| Services | 50% of GDP | The services sector is the largest contributor to the Zambian economy, with major sub-sectors including finance, tourism, and transportation |\n| Tourism | 3% of GDP | Zambia has a growing tourism sector, with major attractions including Victoria Falls, South Luangwa National Park, and Kafue National Park |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Copper: Zambia is one of the largest copper producers in Africa, with major mines located in the Copperbelt Province\n- Cobalt: Zambia is also a significant producer of cobalt, a key component in the production of electric vehicle batteries\n- Tobacco: Tobacco is a major crop in Zambia, with the majority of production being exported to countries such as China and the United States\n- Cotton: Zambia is also a significant producer of cotton, with the majority of production being exported to countries such as China and India\n- Maize: Maize is a major crop in Zambia, with the majority of production being consumed domestically, but with some exports to neighboring countries\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- Machinery: Zambia imports a significant amount of machinery, including equipment for the mining and manufacturing sectors\n- Fuel: Zambia is a net importer of fuel, with the majority of imports coming from countries such as South Africa and Saudi Arabia\n- Vehicles: Zambia imports a significant number of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and buses\n- Electronics: Zambia imports a range of electronic goods, including computers, phones, and televisions\n- Pharmaceuticals: Zambia imports a significant amount of pharmaceuticals, including medicines and medical equipment\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: China is Zambia's largest trading partner, with significant imports of machinery, fuel, and electronics, and exports of copper, cobalt, and tobacco\n- South Africa: South Africa is Zambia's second-largest trading partner, with significant imports of fuel, machinery, and vehicles, and exports of maize, tobacco, and textiles\n- Democratic Republic of Congo: The Democratic Republic of Congo is also a significant trading partner, with imports of copper, cobalt, and other minerals, and exports of maize, tobacco, and textiles\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Transport networks: Zambia has a relatively well-developed transport network, including around 40,000 kilometers of roads, 2,000 kilometers of railways, and several major airports, including Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka\n- Energy: Zambia has a significant energy sector, with a mix of hydro, thermal, and solar power generation, and a number of major power plants, including the Kariba North Bank Power Station\n- Internet and mobile penetration: Zambia has a relatively high level of internet and mobile penetration, with around 70% of the population having access to a mobile phone, and around 20% having access to the internet\n- Ports and airports: Zambia has several major ports and airports, including the Port of Mpulungu on Lake Tanganyika, and the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe Zambian economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by a combination of factors including high copper prices, increased investment in the mining sector, and a growing services sector.

However, the country has a number of major projects and reforms in the pipeline, including the development of a new copper mine in the North-Western Province, and the introduction of a new mining tax regime. The government is also working to promote economic diversification, including through the development of special economic zones and the introduction of tax incentives for foreign investors. Overall, while there are challenges ahead, the Zambian economy has significant potential for growth and development, and is expected to continue to play an important role in the regional economy.",
