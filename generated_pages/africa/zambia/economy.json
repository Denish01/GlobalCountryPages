The country has a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $1,143, and an unemployment rate of approximately 12%. Zambia's economic classification is lower-middle, indicating a developing economy with a mix of traditional and modern sectors. The country's development level is also characterized by a growing service sector, which accounts for the largest share of the economy. Zambia's economic trajectory has been shaped by its natural resource endowment, particularly copper, which has been a major driver of the economy for decades.\n\nDespite the dominance of copper, Zambia has been working to diversify its economy, with a focus on agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote economic growth and development, including investment in infrastructure, trade facilitation, and business environment reforms. Zambia's economy has also been impacted by external factors, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and climate change, which have affected the country's agricultural sector. The country's economic growth has been moderate, with an average annual growth rate of around 3-4% over the past decade.\n\nThe Zambian government has recognized the need to accelerate economic growth and development, and has set out a vision to become a middle-income country by 2030. To achieve this goal, the government has identified key priority areas, including economic diversification, job creation, and poverty reduction. The government has also emphasized the importance of private sector development, and has implemented various initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and investment. These efforts aim to create a more diversified and resilient economy, with a stronger focus on value addition and export-oriented industries.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Main crops include maize, cotton, tobacco, and soybeans, with a growing focus on irrigation and commercial farming |\n| Mining | 15% of GDP | Copper, cobalt, and gold are the main minerals extracted, with significant potential for growth in the mining sector |\n| Services | 50% of GDP | Financial services, tourism, and telecommunications are key contributors to the service sector, with a growing focus on IT and business process outsourcing |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | Main products include food and beverages, textiles, and construction materials, with a focus on import substitution and export promotion |\n| Tourism | 5% of GDP | Zambia's tourism sector is growing, with a focus on wildlife and nature-based tourism, including the famous Victoria Falls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Copper and copper products, which account for the largest share of Zambia's exports\n- Tobacco, which is a significant export crop for Zambia\n- Cotton, which is another important agricultural export\n- Maize, which is a major crop for both domestic consumption and export\n- Cobalt, which is a key mineral export for Zambia\n**Top Imports:** \n- Machinery and electrical equipment, which are essential for Zambia's industrial sector\n- Fuel and petroleum products, which are critical for the country's energy needs\n- Vehicles, which are in high demand for both personal and commercial use\n- Chemicals, which are used in various industries, including agriculture and manufacturing\n- Pharmaceuticals, which are essential for the country's healthcare sector\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China, which is Zambia's largest trading partner\n- South Africa, which is a significant market for Zambia's exports\n- Democratic Republic of Congo, which is an important trading partner for Zambia, particularly for copper and other minerals\n- United Kingdom, which is a traditional trading partner for Zambia, with a focus on exports such as tobacco and cotton\n- India, which is a growing trading partner for Zambia, particularly for imports such as machinery and pharmaceuticals\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Transport networks: Zambia has a well-developed road network, with over 40,000 kilometers of roads, as well as a rail network that connects the country to its neighbors.
