[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia has a range of transportation options, including buses, minibuses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Lusaka having the most comprehensive network. Most people in Zambia get around using minibuses or shared taxis, which are affordable and widely available. However, the condition of the roads and the vehicles can be a challenge, especially during the rainy season.

The main transportation modes in Zambia are road-based, with buses and minibuses being the most popular. The government has invested in improving the road network, but more work needs to be done to make the roads safer and more efficient. In urban areas, there are also taxi services and ride-hailing apps available, which provide a convenient and relatively affordable way to get around. In rural areas, the options are more limited, and people often rely on walking, cycling, or using motorbikes to get around.
