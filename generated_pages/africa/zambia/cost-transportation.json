The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Lusaka having the most comprehensive network. Most people in Zambia get around using minibuses or shared taxis, which are affordable and widely available. However, the condition of the roads and the vehicles can be a challenge, especially during the rainy season.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Zambia are road-based, with buses and minibuses being the most popular. The government has invested in improving the road network, but more work needs to be done to make the roads safer and more efficient. In urban areas, there are also taxi services and ride-hailing apps available, which provide a convenient and relatively affordable way to get around. In rural areas, the options are more limited, and people often rely on walking, cycling, or using motorbikes to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $20 | Limited coverage, mostly in Lusaka |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00 | N/A | Widely available, variable routes |\n| Commuter Train | $5.00-$10.00 | $50 | Limited routes, mostly for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.50 | $1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.50 | $3.00-$6.00 | Uber, Bolt available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20.00-$30.00 | To city center, variable prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40.00-$60.00 | Economy car, variable prices |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5.00-$10.00 | Limited toll roads, mostly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$20.00 | Variable prices, depending on operator |\n| Domestic Flight | $100.00-$200.00 | Typical route, Lusaka to Livingstone |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20.00-$50.00 | Limited routes, mostly for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider using minibuses or shared taxis, which are often cheaper than taxis or ride-hailing services.\n- Use reputable taxi services or ride-hailing apps to ensure safety and avoid overcharging.\n- Negotiate the fare before you start your journey, especially when using taxis or minibuses.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or for traveling in rural areas, where public transportation may be limited.\n- Download transportation apps, such as Uber or Bolt, to book rides and track your journey.",
