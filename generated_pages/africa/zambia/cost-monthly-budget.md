[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia's cost of living is relatively moderate compared to other countries in the region, with a GDP per capita PPP of $4,215. This means that expats and travelers can expect to find affordable options for accommodation, food, and transportation, especially outside of the capital city Lusaka. However, the country's inflation rate of 15.0% can erode purchasing power over time, making it essential to budget carefully. Compared to neighboring countries like South Africa or Botswana, Zambia is relatively affordable, but it is still more expensive than countries like Malawi or Mozambique.

The different budget tiers in Zambia can significantly impact one's lifestyle. A budget of $400 per month will require careful planning and a willingness to live simply, with shared accommodation and limited entertainment options. In contrast, a mid-range budget of $700 per month will provide more comfort and flexibility, with the ability to afford a one-bedroom apartment in a central location and enjoy some recreational activities. A comfortable budget of $1,200 per month will offer a high level of comfort and convenience, with the ability to afford a nice two-bedroom apartment, eat out frequently, and enjoy a wide range of activities and hobbies.
