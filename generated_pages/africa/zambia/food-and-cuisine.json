The country's strategic location in southern Africa has led to a diverse range of cultural and culinary influences, including British, Indian, and Chinese. As a result, Zambian cuisine is characterized by a mix of traditional dishes, such as **nshima** and **injera**, and international flavors, such as curry and stir-fry. Regional variations are also significant, with different provinces and towns having their own specialty dishes and ingredients.\n\nThe influence of British colonialism is still evident in Zambian cuisine, with many traditional dishes, such as **bangers and mash**, still popular today. However, it is the traditional dishes, such as **nshima** and **kapenta**, that truly define Zambian cuisine. These dishes are often made with locally-sourced ingredients, such as maize meal, cassava, and peanuts, and are typically served with a variety of stews and relishes.\n\nIn addition to its unique cultural influences, Zambia's cuisine is also shaped by its geography and climate. The country's fertile soil and favorable climate make it an ideal place for farming, with a wide range of crops, including maize, cassava, and sweet potatoes, being grown. This abundance of fresh produce has led to a cuisine that is focused on fresh, locally-sourced ingredients, with many dishes being made with a variety of fruits and vegetables.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try
