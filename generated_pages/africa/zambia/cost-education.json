However, the quality of public education can vary greatly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer higher quality education but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary school. International schools are also available, catering to expatriate children and offering curricula such as the British or American system.\n\nThe Zambian government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing new curricula. However, challenges such as limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers remain. Despite these challenges, Zambia has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with enrollment rates increasing significantly over the past decade. Private schools, including international schools, offer a range of curricula and teaching methods, and are often preferred by expatriate families and wealthy Zambians.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on location and resources |\n| Private Primary | $200-$1,000 | Range depends on tier and location, with top-tier schools charging higher fees |\n| Public Secondary | $50-$100 (subsidized) | Quality can vary, with some schools offering better facilities and teaching |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,500 | Range depends on tier and location, with international schools charging higher fees |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Offers curricula such as British or American system, with fees varying depending on school and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | University of Zambia is a top-ranked public university |\n| Private University | $1,000-$2,500 | $2,000-$4,000 | Range depends on institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$3,000 | $2,500-$5,000 | University of Zambia and Copperbelt University are top-ranked |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Depends on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$30 | Depends on subject and tutor qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$200 | Depends on language and institution |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Depends on level of study and materials required |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Depends on school and uniform requirements |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The University of Zambia and Copperbelt University are top-ranked universities in Zambia, offering a range of programs and research opportunities.\n- International schools such as the International School of Lusaka and the American International School of Lusaka offer high-quality education and are popular among expatriate families.\n- Scholarships are available for Zambian students, including government-sponsored scholarships and those offered by private institutions.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular, with many institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in Zambia can vary greatly depending on the institution and location, with private schools and international schools generally offering higher quality education.\n- Expatriate families may find that international schools offer the best option for their children, with curricula and teaching methods similar to those in their home country.",
