[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Zambia are generally higher than the regional average, driven up by factors such as transportation costs, import duties, and a relatively low level of domestic food production. The country's **inflation rate** of 15.0% in 2024 also contributes to the rising cost of living, including food prices. Despite this, eating out is a popular culture in Zambia, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a range of traditional and international dishes. However, for those on a budget, home cooking is often the more affordable option, with many locals opting to buy ingredients from markets and cook meals at home.

In terms of what drives prices up or down, the cost of food in Zambia is heavily influenced by the country's **GDP per capita PPP** of $4,215, which is relatively high for the region. This means that there is a significant demand for higher-end food products, which can drive up prices. On the other hand, the country's **inflation rate** and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 10.3% can also impact food prices, as people may have less disposable income to spend on food. Additionally, the **education spend** of 4.1% of GDP can also have an indirect impact on food prices, as educated consumers may be more likely to demand higher-quality and more expensive food products.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Zambia can be significant, with supermarkets often charging higher prices for the same items. This is due to the higher overhead costs of running a supermarket, including rent, staffing, and transportation costs. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and may have better quality control measures in place. In contrast, local markets offer a more traditional shopping experience, with many vendors selling fresh produce, meats, and other staples at lower prices. When shopping at local markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for items like fruits and vegetables.

In general, it's best to buy staples like grains, fruits, and vegetables at local markets, where prices are often lower and the produce is fresh. However, for items like meat, dairy products, and imported goods, supermarkets may be a better option. It's also worth noting that some supermarkets in Zambia offer loyalty programs and discounts, which can help to reduce the cost of shopping. Additionally, many locals opt to buy in bulk and cook meals at home, which can be a more cost-effective option than eating out.
