Primary education, which lasts for 7 years, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 13. Secondary education, which is also compulsory, lasts for 5 years and is divided into two parts: junior secondary and senior secondary. Tertiary education is provided by universities, colleges, and vocational training institutions. The quality of education in Zambia is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** subjects. However, there are significant disparities between public and private schools, with private schools generally offering better facilities and more qualified teachers.\n\nThe public education system in Zambia is free, but it is often underfunded and understaffed. As a result, many families who can afford it opt for private education, which can be expensive. Despite these challenges, Zambia has made significant progress in increasing access to education in recent years, with a significant increase in the number of children enrolled in school. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education, including the introduction of **free primary education** and the establishment of a national curriculum.\n\nThe education system in Zambia is also facing a number of challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. Additionally, the system is often criticized for being too focused on **rote learning**, with not enough emphasis on critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Despite these challenges, Zambia has a number of excellent universities and research institutions, and the country is home to a number of prominent scholars and researchers.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
