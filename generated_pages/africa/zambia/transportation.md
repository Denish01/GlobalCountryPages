[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Zambia has several international airports, with Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka being the main hub, and Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport in Livingstone serving as a secondary entry point. Direct flights to Zambia are available from major hubs in Europe, Asia, and Africa, including Johannesburg, Nairobi, and Addis Ababa. If you prefer to enter Zambia overland, you can do so from neighboring countries such as Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The most popular overland entry points are at Kazungula, Chirundu, and Livingstone.

The main international airports in Zambia offer a range of facilities, including currency exchange, restaurants, and car rental services. However, it is essential to note that the quality of these facilities can vary, and it is always a good idea to research and book your transportation in advance to avoid any inconvenience. Additionally, if you are entering Zambia overland, be sure to research the necessary documentation, such as visas and vehicle permits, and ensure that you have all the required paperwork to avoid any issues at the border.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Zambia has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities and tourist destinations. The main domestic airlines are Proflight Zambia, Royal Air Charters, and Mahogany Air. These airlines offer flights from Lusaka to Livingstone, Mfuwe, and other destinations, with prices starting from around $200 for a one-way ticket. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best rates. You can book domestic flights online through the airlines' websites or through local travel agents.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Zambia's rail network is limited, with only a few routes operating, including the TAZARA railway line, which connects Lusaka to the Tanzanian border. The rail network is not well-developed, and trains are not a common mode of transportation in Zambia. However, the TAZARA railway line is a popular tourist route, offering scenic views of the countryside and a glimpse into local life. The journey can take around 24 hours, depending on the route and the type of train. Booking train tickets can be done through the railway station or through local travel agents.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Inter-city bus companies such as Mazhandu Family Bus Services, Power Tools, and Juldan Motors operate in Zambia, offering a range of routes and services. The buses are generally comfortable and well-maintained, with prices starting from around $10 for a one-way ticket. However, the road conditions can be poor, and the journey can take longer than expected. It is essential to research the bus company and the route before booking and to always use a reputable operator to ensure your safety.
