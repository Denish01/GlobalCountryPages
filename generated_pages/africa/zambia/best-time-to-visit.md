The best time to visit Zambia is during the dry season, from May to October, when the weather is mild and wildlife viewing is optimal. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Zambia: May to October. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: November to April. Avoid: January to March and November to December due to heavy rainfall and extreme temperatures. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia has a tropical climate with three distinct seasons: the cool dry season, the hot dry season, and the wet season. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the northern region, which experiences a more pronounced wet season, the southern region, which is generally drier, and the central region, which has a more moderate climate. The dry season, from May to October, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as **safari** and **hiking**. In contrast, the wet season, from November to April, brings heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making some areas inaccessible and increasing the risk of **malaria**.

The dry season is further divided into the cool dry season, from May to July, and the hot dry season, from August to October. The cool dry season is the best time for wildlife viewing, as the animals congregate around water sources, making them easier to spot. The hot dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for **birdwatching**, as many migratory bird species arrive in Zambia during this time. The wet season, while not ideal for most tourists, is a great time for **fishing** and **boating**, as the water levels are high and the fish are plentiful.

The seasons in Zambia have a significant impact on travel, with many tourist attractions and **national parks** closing during the wet season due to flooding and road damage. Additionally, some areas may be inaccessible due to high water levels, making it essential to plan carefully and research the best times to visit specific destinations. The dry season, on the other hand, is peak tourist season, with many tourists flocking to Zambia to take advantage of the optimal weather conditions.
