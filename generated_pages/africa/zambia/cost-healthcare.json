  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Zambia can vary significantly depending on the type of care and provider, with public healthcare services generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and availability, while private healthcare services are more expensive but offer better quality and wider range of services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $80 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 10.3% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 991\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: ZMW\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nZambia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare services. It is highly recommended to have health insurance in Zambia, as medical costs can be high and unexpected expenses can be financially devastating.\n\nThe healthcare system in Zambia is also affected by the country's limited resources and infrastructure. Many healthcare facilities, especially in rural areas, lack basic equipment and supplies, and healthcare workers often have limited training and expertise. Additionally, the country faces a significant shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in specialized fields. As a result, patients often have to travel long distances to access quality healthcare services, which can be time-consuming and expensive.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and provider |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and provider |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-$10 | $10-$20 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$500 | Prices vary by procedure and provider |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n| X-Ray | $10-$20 | Prices vary by provider and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Outpatient services, basic hospitalization |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Outpatient and inpatient services, specialist consultations, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Comprehensive coverage, including evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-$10 per prescription\n- **Prescription medications** are available at pharmacies and hospitals, but may require a doctor's prescription\n- **Pharmacies** are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are available at pharmacies and some retail stores\n- **Vaccinations** are available at public health clinics and private hospitals, with costs ranging from $10-$50 per vaccination\n- **Medication prices** can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location, with prices often higher in rural areas\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek immediate attention at a hospital or clinic.
