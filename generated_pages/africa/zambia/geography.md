Zambia is situated in the southern part of Africa, bordered by eight countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the northeast, Malawi to the east, Mozambique to the southeast, Zimbabwe to the south, Botswana to the southwest, Namibia to the west, and Angola to the west. The country is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, but it has numerous rivers and lakes that provide water resources and support a wide range of aquatic life. The Zambezi River, which forms the border with Zimbabwe, is one of the most notable waterways in the country.

The location of Zambia has played a significant role in shaping the country's history, culture, and economy. The country's borders have been influenced by colonialism, with the British having established the borders in the late 19th century. Today, Zambia's borders are an important factor in regional trade and cooperation, with the country being a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). The country's strategic location also makes it an important transit point for goods and people moving between southern and central Africa.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Zambia's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, plateaus, and valleys. The country can be divided into three main regions: the high plateau, the middle plateau, and the low-lying areas. The high plateau, which covers much of the country, is a region of rolling hills and mountains, with the highest point being Mafinga Central, which reaches an elevation of 2,339 meters. The middle plateau is a region of gentle slopes and valleys, while the low-lying areas are found in the Zambezi Valley and the Luangwa Valley.

The country's landscape is also dotted with numerous rivers, lakes, and wetlands, which support a wide range of aquatic life and provide water resources for irrigation, drinking water, and hydroelectric power. The Zambezi River, which forms the border with Zimbabwe, is one of the most notable waterways in the country, and is home to the famous Victoria Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in the world. The Luangwa River, which flows through the Luangwa Valley, is another important waterway, and is known for its stunning scenery and diverse wildlife.

The country's terrain and landscape have also played a significant role in shaping the country's ecosystem and biodiversity. Zambia is home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including numerous species of trees, grasses, and wildflowers, as well as a diverse range of wildlife, including elephants, lions, leopards, and buffaloes. The country's national parks and game reserves, such as South Luangwa National Park and Kafue National Park, are renowned for their stunning scenery and diverse wildlife, and are popular destinations for tourists and wildlife enthusiasts.
