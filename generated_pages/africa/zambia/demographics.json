  "content": "The population of Zambia is approximately 20.6 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a unique and culturally rich country in southern Africa.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 20.6 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.9%\nMedian Age: 17.4 years\nUrban Population: 44%\nPopulation Density: 27.5 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 63.1 years\nFertility Rate: 4.7 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nZambia's population size is relatively small compared to other African countries, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 2.9%, which is slightly higher than the global average. The country's population is relatively young, with a median age of 17.4 years, and the urban population accounts for about 44% of the total population. The population density is relatively low, with an average of 27.5 people per square kilometer. Zambia's population is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that it will reach 30 million by 2030.\n\nThe country's population growth is driven by a combination of factors, including high fertility rates and declining mortality rates. However, the population growth also poses significant challenges, including pressure on limited resources, infrastructure, and social services. Urbanization is also a significant trend in Zambia, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. The capital city, Lusaka, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 1.7 million people.\n\nZambia's population is also characterized by significant migration patterns, both within and outside the country. Many Zambians migrate to neighboring countries, such as South Africa and Botswana, in search of work, while others move to urban areas within the country. The country is also a recipient of refugees and asylum seekers from neighboring countries, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bemba | 21% | Northern, Luapula, and Copperbelt provinces | Largest ethnic group |\n| Tonga | 13% | Southern Province | Second-largest ethnic group |\n| Chewa | 7% | Eastern Province | Significant presence in rural areas |\n| Lozi | 6% | Western Province | Traditional rulers of the Barotseland region |\n| Nsenga | 5% | Eastern Province | Significant presence in rural areas |\n| Tumbuka | 4% | Northern Province | Significant presence in rural areas |\n| Kaonde | 3% | North-Western Province | Significant presence in rural areas |\n[/TABLE]\nZambia is a culturally diverse country, with over 70 ethnic groups.
