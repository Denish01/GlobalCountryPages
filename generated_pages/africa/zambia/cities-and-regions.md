[SECTION] How Zambia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Zambia is a sovereign country located in southern Africa, divided into ten provinces: Central, Copperbelt, Eastern, Luapula, Lusaka, Muchinga, Northern, North-Western, Southern, and Western. Each province has its own administrative center and is further divided into districts, which are then subdivided into wards. This administrative structure allows for effective governance and development of the country's diverse regions. The provinces are varied in terms of geography, climate, and economy, with some being heavily urbanized and industrialized, while others are more rural and focused on agriculture.

The ten provinces of Zambia are also grouped into four main regions: the line of rail, which includes the provinces of Lusaka, Central, and Southern; the Copperbelt; the Northern region, which includes the provinces of Northern, Luapula, and Muchinga; and the Western region, which includes the provinces of Western and North-Western. These regions have distinct cultural, economic, and geographical characteristics, and are often referred to in terms of their historical and contemporary development.
