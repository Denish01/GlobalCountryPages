# Zambia Visa & Entry Requirements

You will likely need a visa to enter Zambia, depending on your nationality and the purpose of your visit, with various requirements and regulations in place to ensure a smooth entry process.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Zambia before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Zambia has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from over 40 countries eligible for visa-free access or visas on arrival. The country aims to balance security concerns with the need to promote tourism and economic development. Citizens from countries that do not have visa-free access or visas on arrival will need to apply for a visa at a Zambian embassy or consulate before traveling. Zambia's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel while ensuring the safety and security of its citizens and visitors.

The Zambian government has introduced an e-visa system to simplify the application process for tourists and business travelers. The e-visa system allows applicants to submit their applications online and receive their visas via email. This system has reduced the processing time and made it easier for travelers to plan their trips to Zambia.
