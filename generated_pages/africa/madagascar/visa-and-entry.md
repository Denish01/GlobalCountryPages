[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar has a relatively moderate visa policy, with citizens from around 50 countries eligible for visa-free access or visas on arrival. The country aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel for visitors, while also maintaining security and immigration controls. Citizens from countries that do not have visa-free access or visas on arrival will need to apply for a visa at a Malagasy embassy or consulate prior to their trip.

The visa policy is designed to be flexible and accommodating, with various types of visas available for different purposes, including tourism, business, study, and work. Visitors can stay in Madagascar for a maximum period of 90 days, depending on the type of visa and their nationality. It is essential to note that visa requirements and regulations can change, so it is crucial to check with the official authorities for the latest information before planning a trip to Madagascar.
