[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Madagascar is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President serves as both the head of state and the head of government, and is responsible for appointing the Prime Minister and other government ministers. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, which is a bicameral body consisting of the Senate and the National Assembly. The National Assembly has 151 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for five-year terms. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and other lower courts, and is responsible for interpreting the laws of the land.

The system of government in Madagascar is designed to provide a balance of power among the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. The President has significant executive powers, but is also subject to oversight and approval by the National Assembly. The National Assembly, in turn, is responsible for passing laws and approving the government's budget. The judicial branch provides an independent check on the other two branches, and is responsible for ensuring that the laws are applied fairly and impartially.

Madagascar's political system has been shaped by its history as a French colony, and has been influenced by French and African models of government. The country has a long tradition of democratic governance, but has also experienced periods of instability and authoritarian rule. In recent years, Madagascar has made significant progress in consolidating its democracy and improving its human rights record.
