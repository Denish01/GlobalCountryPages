[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar's housing market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern dwellings, with a growing demand for urban housing driven by the country's rapid urbanization. The rental market in Madagascar is relatively underdeveloped, with many tenants opting for informal arrangements or shared accommodations. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with deposit requirements usually equivalent to one or two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through informal negotiations. Compared to regional neighbors, Madagascar's housing costs are relatively low, with neighboring Mozambique and Comoros experiencing higher rents and property prices.

The housing market in Madagascar is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 9.9% affecting the affordability of housing. However, the government's efforts to improve the education sector, with an education spend of 3.0% of GDP, may lead to an increase in demand for housing in urban areas. Additionally, the out-of-pocket health spend of 27.4% may also impact the affordability of housing, as individuals may need to allocate a larger portion of their income towards healthcare expenses.
