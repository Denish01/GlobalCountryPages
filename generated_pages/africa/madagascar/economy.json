The country has a long history of economic instability, with frequent changes in government and a lack of investment in key sectors. Despite this, Madagascar has made progress in recent years, with economic growth averaging around 4% per year. The economy is largely driven by the agricultural sector, which accounts for around 25% of GDP and employs the majority of the workforce. The country is also rich in natural resources, including minerals, fisheries, and forests, which provide opportunities for economic growth and development.\n\nMadagascar's economy is characterized by a large informal sector, with many businesses operating outside of the formal economy. This makes it difficult to accurately measure economic activity and can limit access to credit and other financial services. The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the business environment and promoting economic growth.\n\nThe Malagasy economy faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to education and healthcare, and a high level of poverty. The country is also heavily reliant on foreign aid, which can create uncertainty and limit the government's ability to implement long-term development plans. However, with a growing population and a strategic location in the Indian Ocean, Madagascar has the potential to become a major player in regional trade and commerce.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 25% of GDP | Main crops include rice, maize, and cassava, with a growing focus on export-oriented crops such as vanilla and coffee |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Madagascar is rich in minerals, including ilmenite, zircon, and chromite, with several large-scale mining projects underway |\n| Manufacturing | 8% of GDP | Main products include textiles, food processing, and construction materials, with a growing focus on export-oriented manufacturing |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | Includes tourism, finance, and trade, with a growing focus on developing the services sector to drive economic growth |\n| Tourism | 5% of GDP | Madagascar's unique natural beauty and cultural heritage make it an attractive destination for tourists, with a growing focus on eco-tourism and sustainable tourism practices |\n| Fisheries | 2% of GDP | Madagascar has a significant fishing industry, with a focus on exporting seafood products to Europe and Asia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Vanilla**, which is one of Madagascar's main export crops and a major source of foreign exchange earnings\n- **Clothing and textiles**, which are manufactured in Madagascar and exported to countries such as the United States and Europe\n- **Fish and seafood**, which are caught in Madagascar's waters and exported to countries such as Japan and China\n- **Minerals**, including ilmenite and zircon, which are mined in Madagascar and exported to countries such as China and Australia\n- **Coffee**, which is grown in Madagascar and exported to countries such as the United States and Europe\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Petroleum products**, which are imported to meet Madagascar's energy needs\n- **Machinery and equipment**, which are imported to support the country's manufacturing and mining sectors\n- **Food products**, including rice and wheat, which are imported to meet domestic demand\n- **Pharmaceuticals**, which are imported to meet the country's healthcare needs\n- **Vehicles**, which are imported for personal and commercial use\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- France, which is Madagascar's former colonial power and a major trading partner\n- China, which is a significant investor in Madagascar's mining and infrastructure sectors\n- United States, which is a major market for Madagascar's export products, including vanilla and clothing\n- India, which is a growing trading partner and investor in Madagascar's economy\n- South Africa, which is a significant trading partner and investor in Madagascar's mining and manufacturing sectors\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The road network in Madagascar is limited, with many roads in poor condition, particularly in rural areas\n- The country has a number of ports, including the port of Toamasina, which is the main entry point for imports and exports\n- Madagascar has several airports, including Ivato International Airport, which serves the capital city Antananarivo\n- The country's energy sector is largely based on imported petroleum products, although there are plans to develop renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power\n- Internet and mobile penetration are growing rapidly, with many Madagascans using mobile phones to access financial services and other online applications\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nMadagascar's economic outlook is positive, with the country expected to continue growing at a rate of around 4-5% per year.
