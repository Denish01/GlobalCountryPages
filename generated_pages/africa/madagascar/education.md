[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Madagascar is structured into three main levels: **primary**, **secondary**, and **tertiary education**. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, is provided by public and private schools, with a focus on basic subjects such as mathematics, language, and science. Secondary education, which is not compulsory, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle, which lasts for four years, and the second cycle, which lasts for three years and leads to the **baccalaureate** examination. Tertiary education is provided by universities and other institutions, with a focus on **academic** and **professional** programs.

The quality of education in Madagascar varies depending on the institution and the level of education. Public schools, which are the majority, often face challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of resources, and poorly trained teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but are often expensive and inaccessible to many students. The government has implemented various reforms to improve the education system, including the introduction of **free primary education** and the establishment of a **national examination** system.

Despite these efforts, the education system in Madagascar still faces significant challenges, including high **dropout rates**, particularly among girls and students from rural areas, and a lack of **qualified teachers**. The government has also introduced programs to promote **technical and vocational education**, in an effort to address the country's high **unemployment rate** and provide students with the skills they need to compete in the job market.
