[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar's food prices are influenced by its **agricultural sector**, which is a significant contributor to the country's economy. The cost of food in Madagascar is relatively low due to the availability of **local produce**, such as rice, vegetables, and fruits. However, the **inflation rate** of 9.9% in 2023 has driven up prices, making it essential for consumers to be mindful of their spending. Eating out is not a common practice in Madagascar, and most people prefer to **cook at home**, which is a more affordable option. The **eating-out culture** is mainly limited to urban areas, such as Antananarivo, where restaurants and cafes cater to tourists and locals alike.

The **food prices** in Madagascar are also affected by the country's **geography**, with transportation costs adding to the overall expense of food items.
