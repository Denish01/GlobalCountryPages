[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with most people relying on **buses**, **taxis**, and **minibuses** to get around. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with the capital Antananarivo having a more comprehensive network than other cities. In rural areas, **bicycles** and **walking** are common modes of transportation due to the lack of paved roads and public transit options. The government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, but there is still a long way to go to provide reliable and efficient public transportation.

The main transportation modes in Madagascar are **road-based**, with a network of highways and roads connecting major cities. However, the condition of these roads can be poor, especially during the rainy season, which can make traveling challenging. **Domestic flights** are also available, connecting major cities, but can be expensive. **Ferries** and **boats** are used to transport people and goods between coastal towns and islands. Overall, getting around Madagascar requires patience, flexibility, and a willingness to adapt to the local transportation culture.
