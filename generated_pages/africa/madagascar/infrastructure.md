# Madagascar Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Madagascar's infrastructure is underdeveloped, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, but the country has been making efforts to improve its roads, power generation, and telecommunications in recent years.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 15% of population
Internet Penetration: 5%
Road Network: 31,640 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: 854 km
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar's infrastructure development level is one of the lowest in the world, with significant challenges in providing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country has been investing in infrastructure development, with a focus on improving the road network, increasing access to electricity, and expanding telecommunications services. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with most infrastructure development concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural areas with limited access to basic services. Recent investments in infrastructure have been driven by the need to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, with a focus on developing the tourism and mining sectors.

The government has been working to improve the infrastructure development framework, with the establishment of a national infrastructure plan and the creation of a dedicated infrastructure development agency. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including limited funding, corruption, and a lack of technical capacity. Despite these challenges, Madagascar has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in the road network, increased access to electricity, and expanded telecommunications services.

The country's infrastructure development is also constrained by its geography, with a mountainous terrain and a long coastline, which makes it difficult to develop and maintain infrastructure. However, the government has been working to develop its **transport infrastructure**, with a focus on improving the road network and expanding the rail network. The country has also been investing in its **energy sector**, with a focus on increasing access to electricity and developing renewable energy sources.

[TABLE]
| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roads | 31,640 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved and in need of maintenance |
| Railways | 854 km | Moderate | Limited network and in need of upgrade |
| Airports | 3 international, 25 domestic | Good | Modern facilities and equipment |
| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Limited capacity and in need of upgrade |
[/TABLE]

The transport infrastructure in Madagascar is underdeveloped, with a limited road network and a lack of modern equipment and facilities. The country has been investing in its road network, with a focus on improving the quality of the roads and increasing access to rural areas. The rail network is limited, but the government has been working to upgrade the existing network and expand it to new areas.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- **Power generation** is mostly based on imported oil and coal, with some renewable energy sources such as hydro and solar power
- The **electricity grid** is limited, with most of the population relying on off-grid energy sources such as generators and batteries
- **Renewable energy** is becoming increasingly important, with the government setting a target of 50% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030
- **Energy access** is limited, with only 15% of the population having access to electricity
- **Power outages** are frequent, with most of the population experiencing regular power cuts

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water** is not safe to drink, with most of the population relying on alternative sources such as wells and rivers
- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with most of the population lacking access to modern sanitation facilities
- **Water access** is a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to clean water
- **Waterborne diseases** are common, with many people suffering from diseases such as cholera and dysentery
- **Wastewater treatment** is limited, with most of the wastewater being discharged into the environment without treatment

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with most of the population having access to mobile phone services
- **Fiber and broadband** services are limited, with most of the population relying on slow and expensive internet services
- **4G and 5G rollout** is underway, with several mobile operators launching 4G services in recent years
- **Postal services** are limited, with most of the population relying on private courier services
- **Internet penetration** is low, with only 5% of the population having access to the internet

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The **Road Network Development Project** aims to improve the quality of the road network and increase access to rural areas
- The **Energy Sector Development Project** aims to increase access to electricity and develop renewable energy sources
- The **Water and Sanitation Project** aims to improve access to clean water and sanitation facilities
- The **Telecommunications Development Project** aims to improve mobile coverage and expand fiber and broadband services
- The **Port Development Project** aims to upgrade the existing port facilities and increase the capacity of the ports
