Madagascar has a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, mining, and tourism, while Mozambique's economy is heavily reliant on natural resources, particularly coal and gas. The cost of living in Madagascar is generally lower than in Mozambique, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being relatively more affordable. However, Mozambique has a more developed infrastructure and a stronger expat community, which can drive up costs in certain areas, such as housing and healthcare.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Madagascar has a larger and more diverse economy, with a growing middle class, while Mozambique's economy is more dependent on foreign investment and aid. As a result, Madagascar has a more developed consumer market, with a wider range of goods and services available, which can contribute to lower prices. On the other hand, Mozambique's economy is more vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices, which can impact the cost of living. Overall, Madagascar offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a cost of living that is approximately 20-30% lower than in Mozambique.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Madagascar (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $350 | 43% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Madagascar (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Madagascar (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Madagascar (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Madagascar (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $400 | $600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | $800 | $1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | $1,200 | $1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Madagascar is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices being 30-40% lower than in Mozambique\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries being 30-50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices being 30-50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices being 30-50% cheaper\n- **Mozambique is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, such as electronics and appliances, which can be 10-20% cheaper due to Mozambique's more developed trade relationships\n- Healthcare, with better-equipped hospitals and more qualified medical staff, although prices may be higher\n- Tourism activities, such as safaris and beach resorts, which can be 10-20% cheaper due to Mozambique's more developed tourism infrastructure\n- Certain educational programs, such as international schools, which can be 10-20% cheaper due to Mozambique's more established expat community\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMadagascar offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a cost of living that is approximately 20-30% lower than in Mozambique.
