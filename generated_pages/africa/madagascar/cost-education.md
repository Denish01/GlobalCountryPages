[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Madagascar is divided into public and private schools, with the public system being generally underfunded and of lower quality. The language of instruction is primarily Malagasy and French, with some English being taught in private schools. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. However, the quality of education can vary greatly depending on the region and type of school. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a higher cost. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of Antananarivo, and offer a range of curricula, including French, British, and American.

The quality of education in Madagascar is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. However, there are some excellent private schools and international schools that offer a high-quality education, often with a focus on **bilingual** or **trilingual** education. These schools are popular among expats and wealthy Malagasy families, but are often out of reach for the average citizen due to high tuition fees.
