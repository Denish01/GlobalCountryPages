  "content": "[FACTBOX]\nLand Area: 587,041 km2, about the size of Texas\nHighest Point: Maromokotro, 2,876 meters\nLowest Point: Indian Ocean, 0 meters\nCoastline: 4,828 km\nBorders: Mozambique, Comoros, but does not share a land border with Comoros\nClimate Type: tropical\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]\nMadagascar is an island country located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa. It is situated approximately 400 kilometers east of Mozambique, with the Mozambique Channel separating the two countries. The island is also close to the Comoros archipelago, but does not share a land border with it. Madagascar's strategic location in the Indian Ocean has made it an important hub for maritime trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The country's unique geography has also allowed it to develop a distinct culture and ecosystem, with a mix of African, Asian, and European influences.\n\nMadagascar's borders are entirely coastal, with the Indian Ocean surrounding the island on all sides. The coastline stretches for approximately 4,828 kilometers, offering a diverse range of landscapes and ecosystems, from coral reefs and mangrove forests to sandy beaches and rocky shores. The country's proximity to the equator and its tropical climate have also created a rich and varied environment, with a wide range of flora and fauna that are found nowhere else on Earth. The island's location has also made it vulnerable to natural disasters such as cyclones and tsunamis, which can have a significant impact on the country's population and infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nMadagascar's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, forests, and coastal plains. The island's central highlands are home to a range of mountain ranges, including the Tsaratanana Massif, which is home to the country's highest peak, Maromokotro. The highlands are also where the majority of the population lives, with the capital city Antananarivo located in the central highlands. The highlands are also home to a range of rivers, including the Onilahy River, which flows through the capital city and provides water and hydroelectric power to the surrounding area.\n\nThe eastern part of the island is home to a narrow coastal plain, which is covered in dense rainforest and is home to a wide range of unique and endemic species. The western part of the island is drier and more barren, with a range of deciduous forests and grasslands. The coastline is also home to a range of unique landscapes, including coral reefs, mangrove forests, and sandy beaches. The island's unique geology has also created a range of unique rock formations, including the famous Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park, which is home to a range of limestone karst formations.\n\nThe island's diverse terrain and landscape have also created a range of microclimates, with different regions experiencing different weather patterns and temperatures. The highlands are generally cooler and wetter than the coastal regions, which are hotter and drier. The island's terrain has also made it difficult to build roads and other infrastructure, with many areas only accessible by foot or by air. Despite these challenges, the island's unique landscape and terrain have made it a popular destination for tourists and adventurers, with a range of outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and surfing available.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hot and Dry | May to October | 20-30°C | low | clear skies, dry weather |\n| Hot and Wet | November to April | 25-35°C | high | humid, rainy, cyclones possible |\n| Cool and Dry | May to August | 15-25°C | low | mild temperatures, dry weather |\n| Cool and Wet | September to November | 18-28°C | moderate | mild temperatures, some rain |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: April to October.
