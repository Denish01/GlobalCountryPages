[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Madagascar is still in the process of development, and the quality of the connection can vary greatly depending on the location. In urban areas such as **Antananarivo**, the capital city, the internet speed is generally faster and more reliable, with several internet service providers offering a range of plans and packages. However, in rural areas, the internet speed is often slow and unreliable, with limited coverage and frequent outages. This **urban vs rural divide** is a significant challenge for the country, and efforts are being made to improve internet access and quality in rural areas.

The reliability of the internet in Madagascar is also a concern, with frequent power outages and network congestion affecting the quality of the connection. However, the government and private sector are working to improve the infrastructure and expand internet access to more areas of the country. Despite the challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for many Malagasy people, with many using it for communication, education, and business. The **Malagasy language** is the primary language used online, but **French** is also widely used, particularly in business and education.

To get a SIM card in Madagascar, tourists can visit one of the many mobile network carrier stores or authorized dealers in major towns and cities.
