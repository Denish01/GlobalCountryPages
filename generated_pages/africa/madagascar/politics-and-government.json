  "content": "Madagascar is governed as a **unitary semi-presidential constitutional republic**, with a system that separates powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Semi-Presidential Constitutional Republic\nHead of State: President (Andry Rajoelina)\nHead of Government: Prime Minister (Christian Ntsay)\nLegislature: National Assembly, bicameral, 151 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 123 out of 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 119 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Madagascar is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President serves as both the head of state and the head of government, and is responsible for appointing the Prime Minister and other government ministers. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, which is a bicameral body consisting of the Senate and the National Assembly. The National Assembly has 151 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for five-year terms. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and other lower courts, and is responsible for interpreting the laws of the land.\n\nThe system of government in Madagascar is designed to provide a balance of power among the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. The President has significant executive powers, but is also subject to oversight and approval by the National Assembly. The National Assembly, in turn, is responsible for passing laws and approving the government's budget. The judicial branch provides an independent check on the other two branches, and is responsible for ensuring that the laws are applied fairly and impartially.\n\nMadagascar's political system has been shaped by its history as a French colony, and has been influenced by French and African models of government. The country has a long tradition of democratic governance, but has also experienced periods of instability and authoritarian rule. In recent years, Madagascar has made significant progress in consolidating its democracy and improving its human rights record.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Andry Rajoelina | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Christian Ntsay | Head of government |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | President of the National Assembly | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Legislative | Senate | President of the Senate | Advisory and review |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Judicial review and interpretation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Young Malagasies Determined | Center-right | Andry Rajoelina | 84 | Ruling party |\n| National Unity | Center-left | Marc Ravalomanana | 20 | Main opposition party |\n| Malagasy Miara Miainga | Center | Albert Camille Vital | 15 | Coalition partner |\n| Economic Liberalism and Democratic Action for National Recovery | Center-right | Mananjara Andriamananoro | 10 | Opposition party |\n| New Forces for Madagascar | Center-left | Fanirisoa Erufael | 5 | Small opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Madagascar is based on a **proportional representation** system, with members of the National Assembly elected for five-year terms.\n- Presidential elections are held every five years, with the most recent election taking place in 2018.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled to take place in 2023.\n- Voter participation in Madagascar's elections is generally high, with turnout rates ranging from 50-70% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Madagascar's political climate is generally stable, but the country has experienced periods of instability and unrest in recent years.\n- Key issues facing the government include poverty reduction, economic development, and improving access to education and healthcare.\n- Regional dynamics play an important role in Madagascar's politics, with the country being a member of the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)** and the **African Union (AU)**.\n- Freedom indices rank Madagascar as \"partly free\", with significant challenges in terms of corruption, judicial independence, and media freedom.\n- The country has made progress in recent years in improving its human rights record, but still faces challenges in terms of protecting the rights of marginalized groups.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Madagascar is a member of the **United Nations (UN)** and the **African Union (AU)**, and participates in regional organizations such as the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)**.\n- The country has close relationships with **France** and other European countries, and has also developed strong ties with **China** and other Asian nations.\n- Madagascar is a signatory to several international treaties and agreements, including the **Cotonou Agreement** and the **WTO Agreement**.\n- The country has a **non-aligned** foreign policy, and seeks to maintain good relationships with countries from all regions and blocs.",
