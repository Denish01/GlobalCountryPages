  "content": "The population of Madagascar is comprised of approximately 31.7 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that shape the country's cultural identity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 31.7 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.7%\nMedian Age: 19.5 years\nUrban Population: 37%\nPopulation Density: 54 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 67 years\nFertility Rate: 4.1 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nMadagascar's population size is significant in the context of African countries, with a growth rate that is relatively high compared to other nations. The population has been steadily increasing over the years, with an average annual growth rate of 2.7%. This growth is largely driven by a high total fertility rate, which remains a challenge for the country's development. Urbanization is also on the rise, with approximately 37% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Antananarivo and other major cities like Toamasina and Antsirabe. Migration patterns in Madagascar are largely internal, with people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of Madagascar is relatively young, with a median age of 19.5 years, which presents both opportunities and challenges for the country's development. The high percentage of young people in the population can be a driving force for economic growth and innovation, but it also puts pressure on the country's education and healthcare systems. The government has been working to address these challenges by investing in education and healthcare infrastructure, as well as implementing policies to promote economic growth and job creation.\n\nIn terms of population trends, Madagascar has made significant progress in reducing mortality rates and increasing life expectancy over the years. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and limited economic opportunities. Addressing these challenges will be crucial to ensuring the well-being and prosperity of the Malagasy people.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Merina | 26% | Central Highlands | Dominant ethnic group in the central highlands |\n| Betsimisaraka | 15% | Eastern Coast | Second-largest ethnic group, primarily found in the eastern coastal regions |\n| Betsileo | 12% | Central Highlands | Closely related to the Merina, with a strong presence in the central highlands |\n| Tsimihety | 7% | Northern Region | Found primarily in the northern regions, with a distinct cultural identity |\n| Sakalava | 6% | Western Coast | Traditionally a coastal ethnic group, with a strong presence in the western coastal regions |\n| Antandroy | 5% | Southern Region | Found primarily in the southern regions, with a distinct cultural identity |\n| Antanosy | 4% | Southern Region | Closely related to the Antandroy, with a strong presence in the southern regions |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Madagascar are diverse and spread across the country, with the Merina being the dominant group in the central highlands.
