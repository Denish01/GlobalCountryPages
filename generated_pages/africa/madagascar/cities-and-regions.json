The country's administrative structure is based on a decentralized system, with each region having a significant amount of autonomy. The regions are grouped into six provinces, although these provinces do not have any administrative powers. The capital city, Antananarivo, is the largest city in the country and serves as the economic and cultural hub.\n\nThe administrative divisions of Madagascar are designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services and the management of natural resources. Each region has its own unique characteristics, with some being more urbanized and industrialized, while others are more rural and agricultural. The regional divisions also reflect the country's cultural and linguistic diversity, with different regions having their own distinct traditions and customs.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Antananarivo** (1.4M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant markets, and stunning natural surroundings\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and urban exploration\n\n**Toamasina** (200,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its strategic location on the east coast and its role in the country's trade and commerce\nBest For: visitors interested in business, trade, and industry\n\n**Antsirabe** (200,000)\nRole: cultural center, tourist hub\nKnown For: its hot springs, scenic landscapes, and traditional crafts\nBest For: visitors interested in relaxation, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n**Fianarantsoa** (150,000)\nRole: cultural center, educational hub\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant arts scene, and stunning natural surroundings\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and education\n\n**Mahajanga** (150,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its strategic location on the west coast and its role in the country's trade and commerce\nBest For: visitors interested in business, trade, and industry\n\n**Toliara** (100,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its stunning beaches, coral reefs, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in relaxation, water sports, and cultural exploration\n\n**Sambirano** (50,000)\nRole: tourist hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning natural beauty, vibrant arts scene, and traditional crafts\nBest For: visitors interested in outdoor activities, culture, and relaxation\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Analamanga | Urbanized, industrialized | Historic architecture, vibrant markets | Antananarivo |\n| Atsimo-Atsinanana | Coastal, tropical | Stunning beaches, coral reefs | Tolagnaro |\n| Haute Matsiatra | Mountainous, rural | Scenic landscapes, traditional crafts | Fianarantsoa |\n| Melaky | Coastal, rural | Stunning natural beauty, vibrant cultural scene | Maintirano |\n| Sava | Coastal, tropical | Stunning beaches, coral reefs | Sambava |\n| Vatovavy-Fitovinany | Coastal, rural | Scenic landscapes, traditional crafts | Manakara |\n| Diana | Coastal, urbanized | Strategic location, vibrant cultural scene | Antsiranana |\n| Menabe | Coastal, rural | Stunning natural beauty, traditional crafts | Morondava |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The coastal regions of Madagascar, such as Atsimo-Atsinanana and Diana, have a more tropical climate and are known for their stunning beaches and coral reefs.\n- The mountainous regions, such as Haute Matsiatra and Vatovavy-Fitovinany, have a more temperate climate and are known for their scenic landscapes and traditional crafts.\n- The urbanized regions, such as Analamanga and Antananarivo, have a more modern and industrialized economy, while the rural regions, such as Melaky and Menabe, have a more traditional and agricultural economy.\n- The cultural differences between regions are also significant, with different regions having their own distinct traditions, customs, and languages.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nMadagascar has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and taxis available. The country's main airport is located in Antananarivo, and there are several other international airports located in major cities such as Toamasina and Antsiranana. The train network is limited, but it connects the capital city to several major cities, including Toamasina and Fianarantsoa. Buses and taxis are widely available, and are a popular mode of transportation for both locals and tourists. However, the road network is not always well-maintained, and driving conditions can be challenging, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe best way to get around Madagascar depends on the region and the type of transportation available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo and Toamasina, taxis and buses are widely available and relatively affordable. In rural areas, such as Haute Matsiatra and Melaky, the road network is not always well-maintained, and driving conditions can be challenging. In these areas, it may be necessary to hire a private vehicle or use a local guide to get around. Additionally, there are several tour operators that offer transportation services, including car rentals and guided tours, which can be a convenient and relatively affordable way to get around the country.",
