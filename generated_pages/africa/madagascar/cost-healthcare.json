  "content": "In Madagascar, healthcare costs are relatively low, with an average health expenditure per capita of $17, but the quality of care varies significantly between public and private facilities, and having insurance is highly recommended for foreigners and locals alike.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $17 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 27.4% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 117\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: MGA\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMadagascar's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities, often located in urban areas, offer higher-quality care with better-equipped facilities and more qualified staff. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients paying out-of-pocket for most services, although some public facilities may offer subsidized care for certain conditions or populations.\n\nThe need for insurance in Madagascar cannot be overstated, as medical costs can quickly add up, especially for serious or chronic conditions. While there is no requirement for insurance, having a policy can provide significant financial protection and access to better-quality care. For foreigners, having international health insurance that covers evacuation to a nearby country or back home is essential, as medical facilities in Madagascar may not be equipped to handle complex or critical cases. Locals may also benefit from having insurance, as it can provide access to private care and help cover out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private clinics may have more specialized services |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private dentists may have more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$30 | Public facilities may have limited eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private labs may have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$50 | Private hospitals may have more comfortable facilities |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Private clinics may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$200 | Public facilities may have limited prenatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Private facilities may have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $10-$30 | Public facilities may have limited imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Private hospital care, specialist services, dental and eye care |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Evacuation to nearby country or back home, comprehensive medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** may require a doctor's note and can cost between $5-$20 per month\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available and can cost between $2-$10 per packet\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- **Prescription rules** vary by medication, but generally require a doctor's note\n- **Common medications** such as painkillers and antibiotics are widely available, but may be counterfeit or of poor quality\n- **Vaccinations** are available at public health facilities and private clinics, and can cost between $10-$50 per dose\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 117, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. However, ambulance services may be limited, and emergency care facilities may not be equipped to handle critical cases. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency evacuation to a nearby country or back home, as medical facilities in Madagascar may not be able to provide the necessary level of care. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally private facilities, such as the **Clinique des Cedres** in Antananarivo, which offer higher-quality care and more modern equipment.\n\nIn the event of a serious medical emergency, it is crucial to seek immediate attention and have a plan in place for evacuation or further care. While Madagascar's healthcare system has its limitations, having insurance and being prepared can help mitigate the risks and ensure access to better-quality care. It is also essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the availability of emergency services and the quality of care at different facilities. By being informed and prepared, individuals can navigate the healthcare system in Madagascar and receive the care they need in case of an emergency.",
