The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the dry season (May to October) leading to increased prices. The government has implemented efforts to improve the utility infrastructure, but the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location. In urban areas like Antananarivo, the capital city, utilities are generally more reliable, but prices are also higher.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Madagascar is also affected by the country's economic conditions, including inflation and currency fluctuations. With an inflation rate of 9.9% in 2023, the cost of utilities can increase significantly over time. Additionally, the country's GDP per capita PPP of $1,884 in 2024 indicates a relatively low standard of living, which can make utility costs a significant burden for many households.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $20 | $30 | $50 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in water bill |\n| **Total** | **$40** | **$70** | **$110** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Telma, Airtel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Telma, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1 GB | Telma, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Telma, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-70 | varies | Telma, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in Madagascar |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Madagascar |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited options available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's recommended to work with a local real estate agent or property manager to ensure a smooth process.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely available and can help households budget their energy usage.\n- Telma and Airtel are popular internet providers in Madagascar, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, households can consider using energy-efficient appliances and conserving water.\n- It's also recommended to negotiate with utility providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
