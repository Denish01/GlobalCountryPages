        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Madagascar has a low-income economy, with a significant portion of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture. The country has a long history of economic instability, with frequent changes in government and a lack of investment in key sectors. Despite this, Madagascar has made progress in recent years, with economic growth averaging around 4% per year. The economy is largely driven by the agricultural sector, which accounts for around 25% of GDP and employs the majority of the workforce. The country is also rich in natural resources, including minerals, fisheries, and forests, which provide opportunities for economic growth and development.</p>
        <p>Madagascar's economy is characterized by a large informal sector, with many businesses operating outside of the formal economy. This makes it difficult to accurately measure economic activity and can limit access to credit and other financial services. The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the business environment and promoting economic growth.</p>
        <p>The Malagasy economy faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to education and healthcare, and a high level of poverty. The country is also heavily reliant on foreign aid, which can create uncertainty and limit the government's ability to implement long-term development plans. However, with a growing population and a strategic location in the Indian Ocean, Madagascar has the potential to become a major player in regional trade and commerce.</p>
