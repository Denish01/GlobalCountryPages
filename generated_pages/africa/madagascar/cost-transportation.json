The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with the capital Antananarivo having a more comprehensive network than other cities. In rural areas, **bicycles** and **walking** are common modes of transportation due to the lack of paved roads and public transit options. The government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, but there is still a long way to go to provide reliable and efficient public transportation.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Madagascar are **road-based**, with a network of highways and roads connecting major cities. However, the condition of these roads can be poor, especially during the rainy season, which can make traveling challenging. **Domestic flights** are also available, connecting major cities, but can be expensive. **Ferries** and **boats** are used to transport people and goods between coastal towns and islands. Overall, getting around Madagascar requires patience, flexibility, and a willingness to adapt to the local transportation culture.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, often overcrowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Routes vary, often crowded |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$2.00 | $20-$30 | Limited routes, often delayed |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Negotiation common |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00-$3.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Bolt, Uber available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10.00-$20.00 | To city center, fixed rate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80-$1.20 | Varies by location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70-$1.10 | Varies by location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-$50 | Economy car, manual transmission |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $0.50-$1.00 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $1.00-$2.00 | Limited toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$20.00 | Varies by route and operator |\n| Domestic Flight | $50.00-$100.00 | Typical route, e.g. Antananarivo to Toamasina |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20.00-$50.00 | Limited routes, e.g. Antananarivo to Toamasina |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Bolt or Uber for convenient and affordable transportation.\n- **Negotiate taxi fares** before starting your journey to avoid overcharging.\n- **Use public transportation** during peak hours to avoid traffic congestion.\n- **Avoid traveling at night** due to poor road conditions and limited visibility.\n- **Be prepared for delays** and cancellations, especially during the rainy season.\n- **Learn some basic Malagasy phrases**, such as \"hello\" (salama) and \"thank you\" (mersi), to help you navigate transportation options.",
