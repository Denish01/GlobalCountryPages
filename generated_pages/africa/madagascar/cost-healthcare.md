[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities, often located in urban areas, offer higher-quality care with better-equipped facilities and more qualified staff. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients paying out-of-pocket for most services, although some public facilities may offer subsidized care for certain conditions or populations.

The need for insurance in Madagascar cannot be overstated, as medical costs can quickly add up, especially for serious or chronic conditions. While there is no requirement for insurance, having a policy can provide significant financial protection and access to better-quality care. For foreigners, having international health insurance that covers evacuation to a nearby country or back home is essential, as medical facilities in Madagascar may not be equipped to handle complex or critical cases. Locals may also benefit from having insurance, as it can provide access to private care and help cover out-of-pocket expenses.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 117, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. However, ambulance services may be limited, and emergency care facilities may not be equipped to handle critical cases. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency evacuation to a nearby country or back home, as medical facilities in Madagascar may not be able to provide the necessary level of care. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally private facilities, such as the **Clinique des Cedres** in Antananarivo, which offer higher-quality care and more modern equipment.

In the event of a serious medical emergency, it is crucial to seek immediate attention and have a plan in place for evacuation or further care. While Madagascar's healthcare system has its limitations, having insurance and being prepared can help mitigate the risks and ensure access to better-quality care. It is also essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the availability of emergency services and the quality of care at different facilities. By being informed and prepared, individuals can navigate the healthcare system in Madagascar and receive the care they need in case of an emergency.
