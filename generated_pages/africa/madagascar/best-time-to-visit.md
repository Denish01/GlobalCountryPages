[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from April to October, is characterized by cooler temperatures and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit the island. The wet season, which runs from November to March, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making it more challenging for travelers. The climate varies across different regions, with the coastal areas being generally hotter and more humid than the central highlands. The dry season is the best time to explore Madagascar's national parks and wildlife reserves, while the wet season is better suited for visiting the coastal areas and enjoying water sports.

The dry season is further divided into two sub-seasons: the cool dry season, which runs from April to July, and the warm dry season, which runs from August to October. The cool dry season is the best time to visit the highlands, while the warm dry season is ideal for visiting the coastal areas. The wet season, on the other hand, is characterized by frequent cyclones and heavy rainfall, making it a challenging time to travel. However, the wet season is also a great time to see the island's landscapes at their most lush and green.

The seasons in Madagascar also affect the availability of certain activities and attractions. For example, the dry season is the best time for hiking and trekking, while the wet season is better suited for surfing and other water sports. The seasons also affect the behavior of the island's unique wildlife, with many species being more active during the dry season. Overall, understanding the seasons in Madagascar is crucial for planning a successful and enjoyable trip to the island.
