[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar's utility infrastructure is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the dry season (May to October) leading to increased prices. The government has implemented efforts to improve the utility infrastructure, but the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location. In urban areas like Antananarivo, the capital city, utilities are generally more reliable, but prices are also higher.

The cost of utilities in Madagascar is also affected by the country's economic conditions, including inflation and currency fluctuations. With an inflation rate of 9.9% in 2023, the cost of utilities can increase significantly over time. Additionally, the country's GDP per capita PPP of $1,884 in 2024 indicates a relatively low standard of living, which can make utility costs a significant burden for many households.
