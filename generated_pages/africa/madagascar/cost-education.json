The language of instruction is primarily Malagasy and French, with some English being taught in private schools. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. However, the quality of education can vary greatly depending on the region and type of school. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a higher cost. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of Antananarivo, and offer a range of curricula, including French, British, and American.\n\nThe quality of education in Madagascar is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. However, there are some excellent private schools and international schools that offer a high-quality education, often with a focus on **bilingual** or **trilingual** education. These schools are popular among expats and wealthy Malagasy families, but are often out of reach for the average citizen due to high tuition fees.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 - $20 | Free or subsidized, but often of lower quality |\n| Private Primary | $200 - $1,000 | Range depends on tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $20 - $50 | Free or subsidized, but often of lower quality |\n| Private Secondary | $500 - $2,500 | Range depends on tier and location |\n| International School | $2,000 - $5,000 | Offers a range of curricula, including French, British, and American |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100 - $500 | $500 - $1,000 | Limited availability for international students |\n| Private University | $500 - $2,000 | $1,000 - $3,000 | Range depends on institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000 - $3,000 | $2,000 - $5,000 | University of Antananarivo is a top-ranked institution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20 - $100 | Range depends on location and quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10 - $30 | Popular among students needing extra support |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50 - $200 | Offers a range of languages, including English, French, and Malagasy |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20 - $50 | Basic supplies, such as notebooks and pens |\n| School Uniform | $20 - $50 | Required for most schools, including public and private |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **University of Antananarivo** is a top-ranked institution, offering a range of programs in fields such as medicine, engineering, and business.\n- **Scholarships** are available for students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, but are often limited and competitive.\n- **Online learning** options are becoming increasingly popular, with many institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- **International schools** are a popular choice among expats, offering a high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- **Private tutoring** is a popular option for students needing extra support, particularly in subjects such as math and science.\n- The **education quality** in Madagascar is generally lower than in other countries in the region, but there are some excellent private schools and international schools that offer a high-quality education.",
