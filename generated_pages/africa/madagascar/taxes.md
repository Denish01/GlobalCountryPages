[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar has a **territorial taxation** system, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, but non-residents are only taxed on income derived from Madagascar. The country considers an individual a tax resident if they have a permanent home in Madagascar, spend more than 183 days in the country in a calendar year, or have their center of economic interests in Madagascar. This means that individuals who live and work in Madagascar for an extended period will be subject to tax on their worldwide income, while those who only have income derived from Madagascar will only be taxed on that specific income.

The tax system in Madagascar is governed by the **Tax Code**, which outlines the rules and regulations for taxation in the country. The Tax Code is administered by the **Ministry of Finance and Budget**, which is responsible for collecting taxes and ensuring compliance with tax laws.
