        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Madagascar's culture is a unique blend of African, Asian, and European influences, shaped by its strategic location in the Indian Ocean. The island has a distinct ethnic and linguistic makeup, with 18 ethnic groups, including the Merina, Betsileo, and Tsimihety, who make up the majority of the population. The official languages, <strong>Malagasy</strong> and <strong>French</strong>, reflect the country's history of colonization and trade. Malagasy is a language that belongs to the Austronesian family, and it is spoken by the vast majority of the population.</p>
        <p>The cultural identity of Madagascar is also defined by its strong tradition of community and respect for ancestors. The concept of <strong>fihavanana</strong>, which emphasizes the importance of social harmony and solidarity, is a core value in Malagasy culture. This is reflected in the many traditional ceremonies and rituals that take place throughout the year, which often involve the entire community. The influence of African, Asian, and European cultures can be seen in the country's music, dance, and art, which are characterized by a rich diversity and creativity.</p>
        <p>Madagascar's cultural identity is also shaped by its history of colonization and its struggle for independence. The country gained independence from France in 1960, and since then, it has been working to preserve its cultural heritage and promote its unique identity. This is reflected in the many cultural festivals and celebrations that take place throughout the year, which showcase the country's music, dance, and art. The <strong>National Museum of Madagascar</strong>, located in the capital city of Antananarivo, is a great place to learn about the country's history and culture.</p>
