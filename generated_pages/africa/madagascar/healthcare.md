[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Madagascar's healthcare system is characterized by a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, which includes a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics. However, the quality of care and accessibility of services vary significantly, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. The public sector faces challenges such as limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, resulting in a lower quality of care.

Despite these challenges, Madagascar has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, particularly in the areas of maternal and child health, and the control of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The country has also implemented various initiatives to increase access to healthcare, including the introduction of a community-based health insurance scheme and the deployment of community health workers to rural areas.

The private sector plays a significant role in Madagascar's healthcare system, particularly in urban areas, where private clinics and hospitals offer a range of services, including specialized care. However, these services are often expensive and inaccessible to the majority of the population, who rely on the public sector for their healthcare needs.
