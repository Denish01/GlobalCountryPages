[SECTION] How Madagascar Is Divided [/SECTION]
Madagascar is divided into 22 regions, which are further divided into 114 districts and 1,579 communes. The country's administrative structure is based on a decentralized system, with each region having a significant amount of autonomy. The regions are grouped into six provinces, although these provinces do not have any administrative powers. The capital city, Antananarivo, is the largest city in the country and serves as the economic and cultural hub.

The administrative divisions of Madagascar are designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services and the management of natural resources. Each region has its own unique characteristics, with some being more urbanized and industrialized, while others are more rural and agricultural. The regional divisions also reflect the country's cultural and linguistic diversity, with different regions having their own distinct traditions and customs.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Madagascar has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and taxis available. The country's main airport is located in Antananarivo, and there are several other international airports located in major cities such as Toamasina and Antsiranana. The train network is limited, but it connects the capital city to several major cities, including Toamasina and Fianarantsoa. Buses and taxis are widely available, and are a popular mode of transportation for both locals and tourists. However, the road network is not always well-maintained, and driving conditions can be challenging, especially in rural areas.

The best way to get around Madagascar depends on the region and the type of transportation available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo and Toamasina, taxis and buses are widely available and relatively affordable. In rural areas, such as Haute Matsiatra and Melaky, the road network is not always well-maintained, and driving conditions can be challenging. In these areas, it may be necessary to hire a private vehicle or use a local guide to get around. Additionally, there are several tour operators that offer transportation services, including car rentals and guided tours, which can be a convenient and relatively affordable way to get around the country.
