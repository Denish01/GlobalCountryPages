The rental market in Madagascar is relatively underdeveloped, with many tenants opting for informal arrangements or shared accommodations. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with deposit requirements usually equivalent to one or two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through informal negotiations. Compared to regional neighbors, Madagascar's housing costs are relatively low, with neighboring Mozambique and Comoros experiencing higher rents and property prices.\n\nThe housing market in Madagascar is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 9.9% affecting the affordability of housing. However, the government's efforts to improve the education sector, with an education spend of 3.0% of GDP, may lead to an increase in demand for housing in urban areas. Additionally, the out-of-pocket health spend of 27.4% may also impact the affordability of housing, as individuals may need to allocate a larger portion of their income towards healthcare expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $100-$200 | $50-$100 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $150-$300 | $80-$150 | Furnished, modern amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $250-$400 | $150-$250 | Family size, spacious living area |\n| 3 Bedroom | $400-$600 | $250-$400 | Luxury amenities, prime locations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $500-$1,000 | Prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $200-$500 | Residential areas, basic amenities |\n| Rural | $50-$200 | Agricultural land, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Haute Ville: $200-$500 USD/month, historic neighborhood with colonial architecture and stunning views of the city\n- Tsaralalana: $150-$300 USD/month, upscale neighborhood with modern amenities and easy access to the city center\n- Andohatapenaka: $100-$200 USD/month, residential neighborhood with a mix of traditional and modern housing\n- Ankorondrano: $80-$150 USD/month, bustling neighborhood with markets and shops, popular with locals and expats alike\n- Ambatomena: $50-$100 USD/month, tranquil neighborhood with a rural feel, located just outside the city center\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Madagascar [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a reliable landlord and avoid scams\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms carefully, and ensure that all agreements are in writing\n- Be prepared for limited amenities and infrastructure in some areas, particularly outside the city center\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment to avoid the hassle and expense of purchasing furniture and appliances\n- Be aware of the **inflation rate** and its impact on the cost of living in Madagascar, and plan your budget accordingly\n- Be mindful of the **out-of-pocket health spend** and ensure that you have adequate health insurance coverage\n- Utilities such as electricity and water are usually not included in the rent, so be sure to factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are more common in urban areas, while unfurnished apartments are more prevalent in rural areas\n- Always inspect the property carefully before signing a lease, and take photos and notes to document the condition of the property.",
