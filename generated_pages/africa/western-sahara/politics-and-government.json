Morocco claims sovereignty over the entire territory, while the Polisario Front seeks independence. The **United Nations** has been involved in efforts to resolve the conflict, but a lasting solution has yet to be found. The separation of powers in Western Sahara is not clearly defined, as the territory is not recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. The Moroccan government exercises control over most of the territory, with a **unitary system** in place, while the Polisario Front administers the remaining areas, with a **presidential system**.\n\nThe political system in Western Sahara is also influenced by the **Arab League** and the **African Union**, which have both recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as a sovereign state. However, the international community is divided on the issue, with some countries recognizing Moroccan sovereignty and others supporting the Polisario Front's claim to independence. The **European Union** has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, while the **United States** has maintained a neutral stance.\n\nThe political landscape in Western Sahara is complex, with multiple actors and interests at play. The Moroccan government has invested heavily in the territory, with a focus on economic development and infrastructure projects. The Polisario Front, on the other hand, has maintained a strong military presence in the area, with support from Algeria and other regional allies. The **Sahrawi people** have been at the center of the conflict, with many displaced or refugees in neighboring countries.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Moroccan Government | King Mohammed VI | Head of State and Government |\n| Executive | Polisario Front | Brahim Ghali | President of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic |\n| Legislative | Moroccan Parliament | President of the House of Representatives | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Legislative | Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's National Council | President of the National Council | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Moroccan Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Interpretation of laws and judicial review |\n| Judicial | Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Interpretation of laws and judicial review |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Istiqlal Party | Center-right | Nizar Baraka | 46 | Part of the Moroccan government coalition |\n| National Rally of Independents | Center-right | Aziz Akhannouch | 37 | Part of the Moroccan government coalition |\n| Polisario Front | Left-wing | Brahim Ghali | 53 | Dominant party in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic |\n| Union of Democratic Forces | Center-left | Abdellah Benkirane | 18 | Opposition party in Morocco |\n| Socialist Union of Popular Forces | Left-wing | Driss Lachgar | 20 | Opposition party in Morocco |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Western Sahara is based on a **mixed system**, with both proportional representation and single-member districts.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent elections taking place in 2021.\n- The voter participation rate is generally low, with many Sahrawis boycotting the elections due to the disputed status of the territory.\n- The next elections are scheduled to take place in 2026, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Western Sahara is characterized by a **low level of stability**, with ongoing tensions between Morocco and the Polisario Front.\n- The key issue facing the territory is the **disputed status**, with Morocco claiming sovereignty and the Polisario Front seeking independence.\n- Regional dynamics play a significant role in the conflict, with Algeria and other neighboring countries supporting the Polisario Front.\n- The freedom indices in Western Sahara are generally low, with restrictions on **freedom of speech** and **freedom of assembly**.\n- The **human rights situation** is also a concern, with reports of abuses by both the Moroccan government and the Polisario Front.\n- The **economic situation** is challenging, with high levels of poverty and unemployment in the territory.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Western Sahara has a complex web of foreign relations, with **Morocco** maintaining diplomatic relations with many countries.\n- The **African Union** has recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as a sovereign state, while the **European Union** has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n- The **United Nations** has been involved in efforts to resolve the conflict, with a **peacekeeping mission** in place since 1991.\n- Western Sahara is a member of the **Arab League** and the **African Union**, but its membership is not recognized by all countries.\n- The territory has also received support from **Cuba** and **Venezuela**, which have recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as a sovereign state.",
