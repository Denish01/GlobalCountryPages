[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Western Sahara has a limited public transportation system, with most people relying on taxis, minibuses, and shared taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with many roads in disrepair and a lack of reliable schedules. However, the main transportation modes in Western Sahara are taxis, buses, and shared taxis, which operate on fixed routes and can be hailed on the street. In larger cities like Laayoune, there are more transportation options available, including private car rentals and tour operators.

The lack of a well-developed public transportation system in Western Sahara makes it difficult for people to get around, especially in rural areas. However, many locals rely on **informal transportation networks**, such as shared taxis and minibuses, to travel between cities and towns. These informal networks can be unreliable and may not always follow fixed schedules, but they provide an essential service for many people in Western Sahara.
