  "content": "The internet in Western Sahara is relatively underdeveloped, with limited connectivity options and slow speeds, making it challenging for travelers and residents to stay online. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Maroc Telecom, Orange Morocco, Mauritel\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet quality in Western Sahara is generally poor, with slow speeds and frequent outages, especially in rural areas. The urban-rural divide is significant, with cities like Laayoune having better connectivity options than smaller towns and villages. The reliability of internet services is also a concern, with frequent power outages and infrastructure issues affecting the overall quality of the connection. In recent years, there have been efforts to improve the internet infrastructure in Western Sahara, but the progress has been slow, and the country still lags behind its neighbors in terms of internet penetration and quality.\n\nThe limited internet connectivity in Western Sahara is largely due to the country's disputed status and lack of investment in its telecommunications sector. The main internet service providers in the country are Moroccan companies, which can make it difficult for users to access certain websites and services. Additionally, the lack of competition in the market has led to high prices and poor quality of services, making it challenging for residents and travelers to stay online. However, despite these challenges, there are still ways for travelers and residents to access the internet, including purchasing a local SIM card or using WiFi services at hotels and cafes.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Western Sahara, travelers can visit one of the main carriers' stores, such as Maroc Telecom or Orange Morocco, and provide their passport and a copy of their visa. The SIM card cost is approximately 10 USD, and data plans start from around 5 USD per month. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as some smaller operators may have poor coverage and quality. Travelers can also purchase a SIM card at the airport or at some hotels, but the selection may be limited.\n\nThe process of purchasing a SIM card in Western Sahara can be bureaucratic, and travelers may need to provide additional documents, such as a proof of address. However, once the SIM card is activated, travelers can access the internet and make calls and send texts. It is also possible to purchase a prepaid SIM card, which can be refilled with credit at most convenience stores and pharmacies. Travelers should be aware that the coverage and quality of the SIM card may vary depending on the location, and it is recommended to check the carrier's coverage map before purchasing a SIM card.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Maroc Telecom | Prepaid | 1GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Orange Morocco | Tourist | 2GB | 10 | Includes 10 minutes of international calls |\n| Mauritel | Data | 5GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days, includes 100 minutes of local calls |\n| Wana Corporate | Business | 10GB | 50 | Valid for 30 days, includes 500 minutes of local calls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally poor, with slow speeds and frequent outages\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not well-developed, but some cafes in Laayoune may offer free WiFi\n- Coworking spaces are limited, but some may offer reliable WiFi and other amenities\n- Public WiFi is not available in most areas, but some government buildings and institutions may offer free WiFi\n- Some restaurants and bars may offer free WiFi, but the quality and reliability may vary\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces in Laayoune may offer reliable WiFi and other amenities, such as meeting rooms and printers\n- Some cafe chains, such as those found in shopping malls, may offer reliable WiFi and a quiet working environment\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots, may be necessary in case of power outages or internet outages\n- VPNs may be necessary to access certain websites and services, especially those blocked by the Moroccan government\n- Some hotels may offer reliable WiFi and other amenities, such as meeting rooms and printers, making them a good option for remote workers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Western Sahara, with some websites and services blocked by the Moroccan government\n- VPNs may be necessary to access certain websites and services, especially those related to politics or human rights\n- Roaming alternatives, such as purchasing a local SIM card or using a mobile hotspot, may be more cost-effective than using international roaming\n- eSIM options may be limited, and travelers may need to purchase a physical SIM card\n- Travelers should be aware of the risks of using public WiFi, especially in areas with poor security\n- The **Moroccan government** has been known to monitor internet activity, and travelers should be cautious when accessing sensitive information online.",
