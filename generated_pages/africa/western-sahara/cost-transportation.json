  "content": "The cost of transportation in Western Sahara varies depending on the mode of transport, with a monthly transit pass costing around $10 USD and a taxi start rate of $1 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($10 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($1 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.20 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (No — limited options)\nCurrency: MAD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nWestern Sahara has a limited public transportation system, with most people relying on taxis, minibuses, and shared taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with many roads in disrepair and a lack of reliable schedules. However, the main transportation modes in Western Sahara are taxis, buses, and shared taxis, which operate on fixed routes and can be hailed on the street. In larger cities like Laayoune, there are more transportation options available, including private car rentals and tour operators.\n\nThe lack of a well-developed public transportation system in Western Sahara makes it difficult for people to get around, especially in rural areas. However, many locals rely on **informal transportation networks**, such as shared taxis and minibuses, to travel between cities and towns. These informal networks can be unreliable and may not always follow fixed schedules, but they provide an essential service for many people in Western Sahara.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $10 | Limited coverage, infrequent schedules |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | Fixed routes, variable schedules |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited options, such as Careem or Uber |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, private car or taxi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, manual transmission |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited schedules, variable comfort |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes, variable schedules |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **shared taxis** or **minibuses**, which can be more affordable than private taxis or car rentals.\n- When using taxis, **agree on the fare** before you start your journey to avoid any disputes.\n- **Bargain** with taxi drivers or shared taxi operators to get the best price.\n- Use **caution** when traveling at night, especially in rural areas, and consider using a reputable taxi service or private car rental.\n- Download **maps** or **transportation apps** to help navigate Western Sahara's limited public transportation system.\n- Consider **renting a car** for longer trips or for more flexibility, but be aware that **road conditions** can be poor and **fuel** may be scarce in some areas.",
