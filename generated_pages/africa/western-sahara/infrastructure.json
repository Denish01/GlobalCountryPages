  "content": "The infrastructure in Western Sahara is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges due to the territory's disputed status and limited resources. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 80% of population\nInternet Penetration: 20%\nRoad Network: 6,200 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nWestern Sahara's infrastructure is characterized by a significant urban-rural gap, with the capital city Laayoune and other major towns having better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and telecommunications. However, rural areas often lack these essential services, and the overall development level of the territory's infrastructure is hindered by the ongoing dispute over its status. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the road network and expanding access to electricity, but much work remains to be done to address the territory's infrastructure needs. The lack of a stable and recognized government has limited the ability to secure significant foreign investment in infrastructure development.\n\nThe territory's infrastructure has also been affected by the **Moroccan occupation**, which has led to the construction of a **berm** or wall that separates the Moroccan-controlled areas from the rest of the territory. This has limited the movement of people and goods, exacerbating the infrastructure challenges faced by Western Sahara. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the infrastructure in Western Sahara, including initiatives to increase access to renewable energy and improve the reliability of the electricity supply.\n\nThe urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge in Western Sahara, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. This has led to a significant disparity in living standards between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better access to infrastructure and services. Addressing this gap will be essential to improving the overall development level of Western Sahara's infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 6,200 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved, limited maintenance |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in Western Sahara |\n| Airports | 3 international, 2 domestic | Moderate | Limited flight connections, mostly to Morocco |\n| Ports | 2 major | Poor | Limited cargo handling capacity, mostly used for fishing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of power generation in Western Sahara is **fossil fuels**, with a limited number of power plants providing electricity to the territory.\n- The reliability of the electricity supply is a significant challenge, with frequent **outages** and power cuts affecting both urban and rural areas.\n- There are efforts underway to increase the use of **renewable energy**, including solar and wind power, to improve the reliability and sustainability of the electricity supply.\n- The Moroccan authorities have invested in upgrading the electricity grid in the areas under their control, but the rest of the territory lacks access to a reliable electricity supply.\n- The lack of a stable and recognized government has limited the ability to secure significant foreign investment in the energy sector, hindering the development of Western Sahara's energy infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern in Western Sahara, with many areas lacking access to safe and clean drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many areas lacking access to basic sanitation facilities such as toilets and sewage systems.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is often limited, with many communities relying on traditional wells and water sources that are vulnerable to contamination.\n- The Moroccan authorities have invested in upgrading the water supply infrastructure in the areas under their control, but the rest of the territory lacks access to a reliable and safe water supply.\n- There are efforts underway to improve the sanitation coverage and water access in Western Sahara, including initiatives to increase the use of **rainwater harvesting** and **water conservation** techniques.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is limited in Western Sahara, with only a few areas having access to mobile phone networks.\n- **Fiber/broadband** internet access is also limited, with only a few areas having access to high-speed internet connections.\n- There are efforts underway to improve the **4G/5G rollout** in Western Sahara, including initiatives to increase the use of **mobile broadband** and **satellite internet**.\n- **Postal services** are limited in Western Sahara, with only a few areas having access to basic postal services such as mail delivery and money transfer.\n- The lack of a stable and recognized government has limited the ability to secure significant foreign investment in the telecommunications sector, hindering the development of Western Sahara's telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- There are several major infrastructure projects underway in Western Sahara, including the construction of a new **port** in the city of Dakhla.\n- The Moroccan authorities have invested in upgrading the **road network** in the areas under their control, including the construction of new highways and roads.\n- There are efforts underway to increase the use of **renewable energy** in Western Sahara, including initiatives to develop **solar** and **wind** power projects.\n- The **European Union** has provided funding for several infrastructure development projects in Western Sahara, including initiatives to improve the water supply and sanitation infrastructure.\n- The **African Development Bank** has also provided funding for several infrastructure development projects in Western Sahara, including initiatives to improve the transport and energy infrastructure.",
