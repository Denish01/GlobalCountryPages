The market is relatively small and largely driven by the local population, with limited demand from foreigners due to the territory's disputed status. The current market conditions are stable, with a slow but steady growth in prices, particularly in the capital city of Laayoune. Urban areas tend to have more modern amenities and infrastructure, while rural areas are often more traditional and lacking in basic services.\n\nThe price trajectory in Western Sahara has been steadily increasing over the years, with a significant surge in prices in the capital city of Laayoune. This is largely due to the growing demand for housing from the local population, as well as the limited supply of properties available. The market is also influenced by the presence of Moroccan settlers, who have been encouraged to move to the territory by the Moroccan government. As a result, the property market in Western Sahara is highly politicized, with many properties being owned by the Moroccan government or its affiliates.\n\nThe property market in Western Sahara is also influenced by the territory's natural resources, including phosphates, fish, and oil. The exploitation of these resources has led to an influx of workers and investors, which has driven up demand for housing and other properties. However, the market is also subject to risks, including the potential for conflict and instability, which can impact property values and the overall market.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Laayoune | 150 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Dakhla | 100 | 150 | House |\n| Smara | 80 | 100 | Apartment |\n| El Aaiun | 120 | 180 | House |\n| Bir Lehlu | 60 | 80 | House |\n| Tifariti | 50 | 60 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Western Sahara, but they must obtain a permit from the relevant authorities, which can be a lengthy and bureaucratic process.\n- Foreigners are restricted from buying property in certain areas, including those near military bases or sensitive installations.\n- Foreign companies can own property in Western Sahara, but they must be registered with the relevant authorities and obtain the necessary permits.\n- Foreigners can also lease property in Western Sahara, with lease terms typically ranging from 5 to 20 years.\n- Foreigners who want to buy property in Western Sahara must also comply with the relevant tax laws and regulations, including paying property tax and other fees.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
