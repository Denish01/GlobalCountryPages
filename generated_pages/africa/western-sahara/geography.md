[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Western Sahara is situated in the northwest part of Africa, with its borders extending from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Algerian and Mauritanian borders in the east. The territory is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, with a long coastline that stretches for over 1,100 kilometers. The border with Morocco to the north is approximately 443 kilometers long, while the border with Algeria to the northeast is around 42 kilometers long. The border with Mauritania to the east and south is roughly 1,561 kilometers long. Western Sahara is a significant territory in terms of its strategic location, with the Atlantic Ocean providing access to major shipping routes and the territory's borders with several countries making it an important hub for trade and commerce.

The location of Western Sahara has been a subject of dispute for many years, with Morocco claiming sovereignty over the territory and the Polisario Front, a Sahrawi nationalist movement, seeking independence. The territory has been occupied by Morocco since 1976, and the dispute has led to a long-standing conflict between the two parties. Despite the dispute, Western Sahara remains an important territory in the region, with significant natural resources, including phosphates, iron ore, and fish stocks. The territory's location also makes it an important stopover for migratory birds, and its coastline is home to a diverse range of marine life.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Western Sahara is a vast and arid territory, with a landscape dominated by the Sahara Desert. The terrain is generally flat, with some rocky outcrops and sand dunes. The territory's highest point is Guerguerat, which is approximately 460 meters above sea level. The lowest point is Sebkha Tah, a salt flat that is around 55 meters below sea level. The coastline of Western Sahara is rugged and rocky, with some sandy beaches and coves. The territory's interior is characterized by a vast expanse of sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and dry riverbeds. The landscape is also dotted with oases, which provide a haven for plants and animals in the harsh desert environment.

The Sahara Desert covers most of Western Sahara, and the terrain is often harsh and unforgiving. The desert is home to a range of unique and adapted plants and animals, including the iconic **dorcas gazelle** and the **fennec fox**. The territory's coastline is also home to a range of marine life, including sea turtles, dolphins, and whales. The coastal waters are rich in fish stocks, and fishing is an important industry in Western Sahara. Despite the harsh conditions, the territory's landscape has a beauty and majesty that is unique to the Sahara Desert.

The terrain of Western Sahara also plays a significant role in shaping the territory's climate. The Sahara Desert is a major factor in the territory's arid climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The desert also creates a range of microclimates, with some areas receiving more rainfall than others. The coastal region, for example, receives more rainfall than the interior, due to the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The terrain also affects the temperature, with the rocky outcrops and sand dunes absorbing and reflecting the sun's rays, creating extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night.
