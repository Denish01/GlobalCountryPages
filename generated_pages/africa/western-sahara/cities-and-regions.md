[SECTION] How Western Sahara Is Divided [/SECTION]
Western Sahara is a disputed territory in the Maghreb region of North Africa, and its administrative divisions are a subject of controversy. The territory is claimed by Morocco, which administers the majority of the territory as its Southern Province, divided into four provinces: Laayoune, Dakhla, Boujdour, and Oued Ed-Dahab. The Polisario Front, which claims independence for Western Sahara, also has its own administrative divisions, but these are not recognized by the international community. The territory's unique cultural and geographical identity is reflected in its administrative divisions, with each province having its own distinct character and economy.

The administrative divisions of Western Sahara are also influenced by the territory's history and geography. The provinces of Laayoune and Dakhla are the most populous and economically developed, with a strong focus on trade and commerce. The provinces of Boujdour and Oued Ed-Dahab are more sparsely populated and have a stronger focus on agriculture and fishing. The administrative divisions of Western Sahara are also affected by the territory's disputed status, with the Polisario Front and Morocco having different visions for the territory's future.
