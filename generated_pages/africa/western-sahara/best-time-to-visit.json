The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal region, which has a milder climate, and the interior, which is much hotter and drier. The **dry season**, which lasts from October to June, is characterized by very little rainfall and extreme heat during the summer months. The **wet season**, which lasts from July to September, is marked by occasional rainfall and higher humidity. The seasons in Western Sahara have a significant impact on travel, with the winter months being the best time to visit due to the pleasant weather.\n\nThe **coastal region** has a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 17°C to 23°C (63°F to 73°F) during the winter months. The interior, on the other hand, is much hotter, with average temperatures often reaching 40°C (104°F) during the summer months. The extreme heat and humidity during the summer months make it difficult to travel, especially in the interior.
