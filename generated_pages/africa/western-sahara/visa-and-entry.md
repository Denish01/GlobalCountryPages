[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Western Sahara has a strict visa policy due to its disputed status and limited international recognition. As a result, only a few countries have visa-free access, and most travelers need to obtain a visa before entering the territory. The visa policy is largely controlled by the Moroccan government, which has administered the territory since 1976. The Moroccan government has a complex visa system, with different requirements for different nationalities and types of travelers.

The visa policy for Western Sahara is closely tied to Morocco's visa policy, and travelers can often enter Western Sahara with a Moroccan visa. However, it is essential to note that some countries do not recognize Moroccan control over Western Sahara, and their citizens may face difficulties or restrictions when trying to enter the territory.
