  "content": "Western Sahara's economy is primarily driven by its natural resources, particularly phosphates, and is heavily influenced by its disputed status and reliance on neighboring countries. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($0.9 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($1,500 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Lower-Middle)\nMain Industries: phosphate mining, fishing, agriculture\nCurrency: MAD\nUnemployment Rate: (approximate 30%)\nEase of Doing Business: ( ranked 173 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nWestern Sahara has a lower-middle-income economy, with a relatively small GDP and a significant dependence on external aid and support. The country's economic development is hindered by its disputed status, which limits its ability to engage in international trade and attract foreign investment. The economy is also heavily reliant on the primary sector, particularly phosphate mining, which is a significant contributor to the country's GDP. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented various initiatives to diversify the economy and promote economic growth.\n\nThe country's economic trajectory is closely tied to the economic performance of its neighbors, particularly Morocco, which has de facto control over much of Western Sahara's territory. The Moroccan government has invested heavily in the region's infrastructure, including roads, ports, and energy systems, which has helped to boost economic activity. However, the lack of international recognition and the ongoing dispute over the territory's status continue to pose significant challenges to the country's economic development.\n\nThe economy of Western Sahara is also characterized by a significant informal sector, with many people engaged in subsistence farming, herding, and small-scale trade. The country's remote location and limited connectivity also make it difficult to access markets and trade with other countries, which further exacerbates the economic challenges.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Phosphate Mining | 60% | Western Sahara has significant phosphate reserves, and mining is a major contributor to the country's GDP |\n| Fishing | 20% | The country's coastal waters are rich in fish, and fishing is an important industry, with many fishing companies operating in the area |\n| Agriculture | 10% | Agriculture is a significant sector, with crops such as dates, tomatoes, and potatoes being grown, primarily for domestic consumption |\n| Manufacturing | 5% | Manufacturing is a small but growing sector, with companies producing goods such as textiles, food products, and construction materials |\n| Services | 5% | The services sector, including tourism and finance, is also a growing sector, although it remains relatively small |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Phosphates: Western Sahara is one of the world's largest producers of phosphates, with most exports going to countries such as Morocco, Spain, and India\n- Fish and seafood: The country's fishing industry is significant, with exports of fish and seafood products going to countries such as Spain, France, and Japan\n- Agricultural products: Western Sahara exports agricultural products such as dates, tomatoes, and potatoes to countries such as Morocco and Algeria\n- Minerals: The country also exports minerals such as iron ore and gypsum to countries such as China and India\n- Handicrafts: Traditional handicrafts, such as textiles and pottery, are also exported to countries such as Morocco and Spain\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- Food products: Western Sahara imports a significant amount of food products, including wheat, sugar, and dairy products, from countries such as Morocco and Spain\n- Fuel: The country imports fuel, including gasoline and diesel, from countries such as Morocco and Algeria\n- Machinery: Western Sahara imports machinery, including construction equipment and vehicles, from countries such as China and the United States\n- Electronics: The country also imports electronics, including computers and telecommunications equipment, from countries such as China and the United Arab Emirates\n- Construction materials: Western Sahara imports construction materials, including cement and steel, from countries such as Morocco and China\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Morocco: Morocco is Western Sahara's largest trading partner, with the two countries having a significant trade relationship\n- Spain: Spain is also an important trading partner, with Western Sahara exporting phosphates and fish products to the country\n- Algeria: Algeria is another key trading partner, with Western Sahara importing fuel and other goods from the country\n- China: China is also an important trading partner, with Western Sahara importing machinery and electronics from the country\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Western Sahara has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with few paved roads and limited access to international airports\n- The country has a number of ports, including the port of Dakhla, which is an important hub for fishing and trade\n- Energy production is limited, with most of the country's energy needs being met through imports from Morocco\n- Internet and mobile penetration is relatively low, with limited access to telecommunications services in rural areas\n- The country has a number of airports, including the Laayoune Hassan I Airport, which receives flights from Morocco and other countries\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe economic outlook for Western Sahara is uncertain, with the country's disputed status and limited international recognition posing significant challenges to economic development. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to promote economic growth and diversification, including investments in infrastructure and the development of the tourism sector. The country's significant phosphate reserves and fishing industry also provide opportunities for economic growth and development.\n\nDespite these challenges, Western Sahara has the potential to develop a more diversified economy, with a growing services sector and increased investment in infrastructure. The country's strategic location, with access to the Atlantic Ocean and proximity to European markets, also provides opportunities for trade and economic growth. However, the resolution of the country's disputed status and increased international recognition will be critical to unlocking Western Sahara's economic potential and promoting sustainable economic development.",
