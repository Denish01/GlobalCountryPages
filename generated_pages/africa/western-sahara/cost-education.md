[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Western Sahara is overseen by the Moroccan government, which has authority over the territory. Public education is generally free or subsidized, but the quality can vary depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a cost. The language of instruction is Arabic, with some schools also teaching Berber and French. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from ages 6 to 12, and is followed by secondary education, which is not compulsory but is highly recommended. International schools are scarce in Western Sahara, and those that exist are mainly located in the capital city of Laayoune.

The education system in Western Sahara faces several challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the Moroccan government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing access to education and improving the quality of teaching. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in education between different regions and communities. For example, schools in urban areas tend to have better facilities and more qualified teachers than those in rural areas.
