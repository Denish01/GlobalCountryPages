Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are somewhat limited, and it is essential for renters to carefully review and understand their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Western Sahara's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices in Morocco and Mauritania tend to be higher, while those in Algeria can be lower.\n\nThe housing market in Western Sahara is also influenced by the country's disputed status, which can affect the availability and affordability of housing options. Additionally, the local economy is largely driven by the phosphate mining industry, which can impact the demand for housing, particularly in the capital city. As a result, renters may find that prices and availability can vary depending on the time of year and the state of the local economy. It is essential for renters to research the local market and work with reputable real estate agents or landlords to find suitable and affordable housing options.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | 150-250 | 80-150 | basic amenities, 20-30 sqm |\n| 1 Bedroom | 200-300 | 100-200 | standard amenities, 40-60 sqm |\n| 2 Bedroom | 300-450 | 150-300 | mid-range amenities, 80-100 sqm |\n| 3 Bedroom | 450-600 | 250-450 | spacious, 120-150 sqm |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | 1,500-2,500 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | 1,000-2,000 | residential areas, some amenities |\n| Rural | 500-1,000 | limited amenities, traditional housing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **El Aaiun**: a popular neighborhood in the capital city, with a range of amenities and services, rent range $200-500 per month\n- **Dakhla**: a coastal neighborhood with a more relaxed atmosphere, rent range $150-300 per month\n- **Smara**: a neighborhood with a mix of traditional and modern housing, rent range $100-250 per month\n- **Bou Craa**: a neighborhood with a strong sense of community, rent range $80-200 per month\n- **El Marsa**: a upscale neighborhood with modern amenities, rent range $300-600 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Western Sahara [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and work with reputable real estate agents or landlords to find suitable and affordable housing options\n- Be prepared to negotiate prices and terms, as this is a common practice in Western Sahara\n- Ensure that you understand your lease agreement and any conditions or requirements before signing\n- Be aware of potential scams, such as fake rental listings or unscrupulous landlords\n- Consider working with a local expat community or organization to find housing and get advice on the rental process\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so be sure to factor these costs into your budget",
