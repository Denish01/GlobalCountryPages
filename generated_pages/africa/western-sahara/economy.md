[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Western Sahara has a lower-middle-income economy, with a relatively small GDP and a significant dependence on external aid and support. The country's economic development is hindered by its disputed status, which limits its ability to engage in international trade and attract foreign investment. The economy is also heavily reliant on the primary sector, particularly phosphate mining, which is a significant contributor to the country's GDP. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented various initiatives to diversify the economy and promote economic growth.

The country's economic trajectory is closely tied to the economic performance of its neighbors, particularly Morocco, which has de facto control over much of Western Sahara's territory. The Moroccan government has invested heavily in the region's infrastructure, including roads, ports, and energy systems, which has helped to boost economic activity. However, the lack of international recognition and the ongoing dispute over the territory's status continue to pose significant challenges to the country's economic development.

The economy of Western Sahara is also characterized by a significant informal sector, with many people engaged in subsistence farming, herding, and small-scale trade. The country's remote location and limited connectivity also make it difficult to access markets and trade with other countries, which further exacerbates the economic challenges.
