  "content": "To get around in Western Sahara, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, and taxis, as well as rent a car to explore the territory, although options may be limited due to its disputed status and lack of infrastructure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Hassan I Airport (EUN)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nWestern Sahara has limited international connections, with the main entry point being Hassan I Airport in Laayoune, which receives flights from Morocco and other neighboring countries. There are no direct flights from major European or American hubs, so travelers often need to connect through Casablanca or other North African cities. Overland entry points exist along the borders with Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania, but these may be subject to restrictions and require special permits.\n\nThe main border crossings are at Guerguerat with Mauritania, and Tindouf with Algeria, although these may be closed or restricted due to security concerns. Travelers should research the current situation and requirements before attempting to enter Western Sahara by land. Additionally, the Moroccan authorities control the border with Western Sahara, and entry requirements may vary depending on the current political situation.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic flights within Western Sahara are limited, with Royal Air Maroc being one of the few airlines operating flights between Laayoune and other major towns such as Dakhla and Smara. Booking in advance is recommended, as flights may be infrequent and subject to change. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and time of year. Travelers should check with the airline for the latest schedules and prices, as well as any travel restrictions or requirements.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in Western Sahara, so trains are not an option for getting around the territory. This is due to the territory's limited infrastructure and disputed status, which has hindered the development of a rail system.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus companies such as CTM and Fes Bus operate in Western Sahara, connecting major towns like Laayoune, Dakhla, and Smara. The quality of the buses varies, but they are generally comfortable and affordable, with prices ranging from $10 to $50, depending on the route and class of service.
