  "content": "The primary languages spoken in Western Sahara are Arabic and Berber, with Arabic being the most widely used language in official and everyday contexts.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Arabic, Berber\nWidely Spoken: Spanish, French\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Arabic\nLanguage Family: Afro-Asiatic\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Western Sahara is characterized by the dominant use of Arabic, which is the language of government, education, and media. Berber, also known as **Tamazight**, is spoken by the indigenous Berber population and is recognized as an official language. Spanish and French are also widely spoken, particularly among the older population, due to the territory's history of colonization by Spain and its current administration by Morocco, which was a French protectorate. English proficiency is generally low, particularly outside of tourist areas and among older generations. The Arabic script is used to write Arabic, while Berber languages use the **Tifinagh** script or the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe regional dialects of Arabic spoken in Western Sahara are influenced by the territory's geographical location and its cultural exchange with neighboring countries. The **Hassaniya** dialect, which is also spoken in Mauritania and parts of Morocco, is commonly used in Western Sahara. Minority languages, such as **Zenaga**, are spoken by smaller communities, particularly in rural areas. English is not widely understood, and visitors may need to rely on translation tools or seek out English-speaking locals, particularly in the capital city of Laayoune.\n\nThe use of language in Western Sahara is often tied to social and cultural contexts. For example, Arabic is commonly used in formal settings, such as government offices and schools, while Berber languages may be used in more informal settings, such as family gatherings and traditional events. The language spoken can also vary depending on the region, with some areas having a stronger Berber influence and others having a more dominant Arabic influence.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | As-salamu alaykum | ah-sah-lah-moo ah-lay-koom | formal |\n| Hello | Marhaba | mar-hah-bah | informal |\n| Thank you | Shukraan | shoo-krah-n | formal |\n| Thank you | Barak allahu feek | bah-rak ah-lah-hoo fee-k | informal |\n| Please | Afwan | ahf-wahn | formal |\n| Please | La shukraan | lah shoo-krah-n | informal |\n| Yes / No | Na'am / Laa | nah-am / lah | formal |\n| Excuse me | A'udhu billahi | ah-oo-dhoo bee-lah-hee | formal |\n| How much? | Kam? | kahm | formal |\n| Where is...? | Ayn...? | ay-n | formal |\n| I don't understand | La afham | lah ahf-hahm | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Hal tatakallam al-ingliziya? | hahl tah-tah-kah-lahm ah-leen-glee-zee-yah | formal |\n| Help! | Musa'ada! | moo-sah-ah-dah | formal |\n| Goodbye | Ma'a as-salaama | mah-ah ah-sah-lah-mah | formal |\n| Sorry | Aasif | ah-see-f | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Wahid | wah-heed |\n| 2 | Ithnayn | ith-nayn |\n| 3 | Thalatha | thah-lah-thah |\n| 4 | Arba'a | ar-bah-ah |\n| 5 | Khamsa | khahm-sah |\n| 6 | Sitta | see-tah |\n| 7 | Sab'a | sah-bah-ah |\n| 8 | Thamaaniya | thah-mah-nee-yah |\n| 9 | Tis'a | tee-sah-ah |\n| 10 | Ashara | ah-shah-rah |\n| 100 | Mi'a | mee-ah |\n| 1000 | Alf | ahlf |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when interacting with elderly individuals or in formal settings.\n- Use formal language and titles, such as **Mr.** or **Mrs.**, when addressing older individuals or those in positions of authority.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered impolite, such as pointing with the left hand or crossing one's legs.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Arabic, such as **as-salamu alaykum** (hello) and **shukraan** (thank you), to show respect for the local culture.\n- Be patient and polite when communicating with locals, particularly if they do not speak English.\n- Use body language, such as nodding or smiling, to show appreciation and respect.\n- Avoid discussing sensitive topics, such as politics or conflict, in public or with individuals you do not know well.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as **Google Translate**, to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Learn the Arabic alphabet and practice writing and reading Arabic script.\n- Take a language course or work with a tutor to improve your Arabic language skills before traveling to Western Sahara.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites or YouTube channels, to learn more about the culture and language of Western Sahara.",
