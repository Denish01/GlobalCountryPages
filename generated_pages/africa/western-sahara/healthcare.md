[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Western Sahara is a mix of public and private providers, with the majority of healthcare services provided by the Moroccan government, which claims sovereignty over the territory. The public healthcare system is underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of access to quality healthcare, especially in rural areas. The private sector is limited, and most private healthcare providers are located in the capital city of Laayoune. The quality of care is generally basic, with limited access to specialized care and modern medical equipment. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services, but even in cities, the quality of care can be inconsistent.

The healthcare system in Western Sahara faces numerous challenges, including a lack of funding, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. Many healthcare workers are trained in Morocco or other countries, and there is a significant brain drain of skilled healthcare professionals leaving the territory to work in other countries. The Moroccan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, but the territory's disputed status and lack of international recognition have limited the ability to attract international aid and investment.

Despite these challenges, there are some efforts to improve the healthcare system in Western Sahara, including the establishment of new hospitals and healthcare facilities, and the training of local healthcare workers. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant healthcare needs of the population, particularly in rural areas.
