[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Western Sahara has a **desert climate**, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal region, which has a milder climate, and the interior, which is much hotter and drier. The **dry season**, which lasts from October to June, is characterized by very little rainfall and extreme heat during the summer months. The **wet season**, which lasts from July to September, is marked by occasional rainfall and higher humidity. The seasons in Western Sahara have a significant impact on travel, with the winter months being the best time to visit due to the pleasant weather.

The **coastal region** has a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 17°C to 23°C (63°F to 73°F) during the winter months. The interior, on the other hand, is much hotter, with average temperatures often reaching 40°C (104°F) during the summer months. The extreme heat and humidity during the summer months make it difficult to travel, especially in the interior. The **winter months** are the best time to visit Western Sahara, as the weather is mild and pleasant, making it ideal for exploring the desert landscapes and coastal towns.

The **shoulder season**, which includes the months of October and November, and March and April, can also be a good time to visit Western Sahara. The weather is still pleasant, and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak season. However, it's essential to be prepared for occasional rainfall and higher humidity during the shoulder season.
