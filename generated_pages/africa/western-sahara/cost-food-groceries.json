The cost of transportation and importation of goods drives prices up, making it challenging for residents to afford basic necessities. However, the eating-out culture is not as prevalent in Western Sahara as it is in other parts of the world, with many locals preferring to cook at home. This is partly due to the fact that eating out can be expensive, and also because home-cooked meals are often seen as a way to preserve traditional cuisine and culture.\n\nThe prices of food in Western Sahara can fluctuate depending on the season, with prices tend to be higher during the summer months when demand is higher. Additionally, the political situation in the country can also impact food prices, with occasional shortages and price hikes occurring due to trade disruptions. Despite these challenges, the local population has adapted to the situation, with many residents relying on traditional ingredients and cooking methods to make ends meet. The **Berber** and **Arabic** influences on the local cuisine are evident in the use of ingredients such as **couscous**, **tagine**, and **kebabs**.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 15 MAD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.00 | 10 MAD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 20 MAD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50 | 15 MAD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 60 MAD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 100 MAD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 30 MAD | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00 | 20 MAD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 15 MAD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00 | 10 MAD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 80 MAD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 10 MAD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 | traditional dishes like **shawarma** and **falafel** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-15 | one person, basic meal |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-30 | 3 courses, moderate quality |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-70 | upscale, high-quality ingredients |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Western Sahara.
