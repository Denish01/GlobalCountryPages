  "content": "Healthcare in Western Sahara is a challenging and limited system, with a mix of public and private providers, but overall, the quality of care is basic and often inaccessible to the majority of the population, especially in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 15\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Western Sahara is a mix of public and private providers, with the majority of healthcare services provided by the Moroccan government, which claims sovereignty over the territory. The public healthcare system is underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of access to quality healthcare, especially in rural areas. The private sector is limited, and most private healthcare providers are located in the capital city of Laayoune. The quality of care is generally basic, with limited access to specialized care and modern medical equipment. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services, but even in cities, the quality of care can be inconsistent.\n\nThe healthcare system in Western Sahara faces numerous challenges, including a lack of funding, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. Many healthcare workers are trained in Morocco or other countries, and there is a significant brain drain of skilled healthcare professionals leaving the territory to work in other countries. The Moroccan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, but the territory's disputed status and lack of international recognition have limited the ability to attract international aid and investment.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are some efforts to improve the healthcare system in Western Sahara, including the establishment of new hospitals and healthcare facilities, and the training of local healthcare workers. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant healthcare needs of the population, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mohammed VI Hospital | Laayoune | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Ibn Sina Hospital | Laayoune | Private | General medicine, cardiology, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Dakhla Hospital | Dakhla | Public | General medicine, emergency care | Limited |\n| Smara Hospital | Smara | Public | General medicine, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Boujdour Hospital | Boujdour | Public | General medicine, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Spanish Hospital | Laayoune | Private | General medicine, surgery, dentistry | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it can provide access to better-quality care and more specialized services.\n- **Local insurance options** are limited, and most insurance plans are designed for Moroccan citizens or residents.\n- **Expats and foreigners** may need to purchase international health insurance to cover their healthcare needs, as local insurance plans may not provide adequate coverage.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the type of insurance plan and the level of coverage.\n- **Government-sponsored insurance** is available for some citizens, but it is limited and often does not provide adequate coverage.\n- **Private insurance companies** offer a range of plans, including comprehensive plans that cover a wide range of healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are available in limited quantities, and many pharmacies may not have a wide range of medications in stock.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but many medications can be purchased over-the-counter without a prescription.\n- **Common brands** of medications may not be available, and generic or local brands may be substituted.\n- **Costs** can be high, especially for imported medications, and many people may not be able to afford the medications they need.\n- **Availability** of medications can be a significant challenge, especially in rural areas, where pharmacies may be scarce or poorly stocked.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include yellow fever, hepatitis A, and typhoid, and it is recommended that travelers be up-to-date on all routine vaccinations.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis B, rabies, and meningitis, depending on the individual's risk factors and activities.\n- **Endemic diseases** include malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, and travelers should take precautions to avoid infection.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking tap water or eating unpeeled fruits and vegetables.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables.\n- **Heat stroke** and **dehydration** are significant risks, especially during the summer months, and travelers should take precautions to stay cool and hydrated.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Western Sahara, due to the limited availability of high-quality healthcare services.\n- **Some hospitals** in Laayoune may offer specialized services, such as orthopedic surgery or cardiology, but these services are not well-developed.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for some medical procedures, but the quality of care may not be comparable to that in other countries.\n- **Accreditation** is limited, and many hospitals and healthcare facilities may not meet international standards for quality and safety.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency services** are limited, and response times may be slow, especially in rural areas.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is a concern, and travelers may need to rely on private transportation or taxis in an emergency.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be far away, and travelers may need to be transported to a hospital in a neighboring country for specialized care.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, and travelers should be sure to keep detailed records of their medical expenses and treatment.\n- **Emergency contact information** should be kept handy, including the phone numbers of local hospitals, clinics, and emergency services.",
