  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Western Sahara can vary significantly depending on the type of care and provider, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often limited in quality and availability, while private healthcare is more expensive but offers better quality and more comprehensive services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $114\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 71.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 15\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: MAD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Western Sahara is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, but the quality of care can be limited, and facilities may be understaffed and underfunded. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers better quality and more comprehensive services, but at a significantly higher cost. Locals often rely on public healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. Having insurance is recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the costs of medical care and provide access to better quality services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Western Sahara faces significant challenges, including a lack of resources, infrastructure, and trained healthcare professionals. Many healthcare facilities are understaffed and underequipped, and medical supplies and equipment may be in short supply. Despite these challenges, there are some good quality healthcare facilities in the larger towns and cities, such as Laayoune, which offer a range of services, including emergency care, surgical services, and specialized care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private clinics may have more experienced specialists |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private dental clinics may have more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private optometrists may have more advanced technology |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may have more comfortable facilities |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$500 | Private clinics may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may have more modern equipment |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private clinics may have more advanced technology |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Private hospital care, specialized services, emergency evacuation |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, comprehensive services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available at pharmacies and may cost between $5-$20 per prescription\n- Prescription rules are generally lenient, and many medications can be purchased over-the-counter\n- Pharmacy availability is limited in rural areas, where patients may need to travel to larger towns to access medication\n- Over-the-counter medications such as cold and flu remedies may cost between $10-$30 per package\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medications with you when traveling to Western Sahara, as availability and quality may vary\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 15, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are limited, and it may be necessary to arrange for private transportation to the hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private hospitals, which may have more modern equipment and better trained staff. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency evacuation, as medical facilities in Western Sahara may not be equipped to handle complex or critical cases.\n\nFor foreigners, it is especially important to have a plan in place for emergency care, as the quality and availability of medical services can be limited. Many private hospitals and clinics have relationships with international insurance providers and can facilitate emergency evacuation if necessary. It is also recommended to research and identify reputable hospitals and clinics before arriving in Western Sahara, and to have a list of emergency contact numbers and services readily available.",
