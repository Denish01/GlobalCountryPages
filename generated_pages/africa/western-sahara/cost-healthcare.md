[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Western Sahara is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, but the quality of care can be limited, and facilities may be understaffed and underfunded. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers better quality and more comprehensive services, but at a significantly higher cost. Locals often rely on public healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. Having insurance is recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the costs of medical care and provide access to better quality services.

The healthcare system in Western Sahara faces significant challenges, including a lack of resources, infrastructure, and trained healthcare professionals. Many healthcare facilities are understaffed and underequipped, and medical supplies and equipment may be in short supply. Despite these challenges, there are some good quality healthcare facilities in the larger towns and cities, such as Laayoune, which offer a range of services, including emergency care, surgical services, and specialized care.

- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available at pharmacies and may cost between $5-$20 per prescription
- Prescription rules are generally lenient, and many medications can be purchased over-the-counter
- Pharmacy availability is limited in rural areas, where patients may need to travel to larger towns to access medication
- Over-the-counter medications such as cold and flu remedies may cost between $10-$30 per package
- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs
- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medications with you when traveling to Western Sahara, as availability and quality may vary

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 15, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are limited, and it may be necessary to arrange for private transportation to the hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private hospitals, which may have more modern equipment and better trained staff. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency evacuation, as medical facilities in Western Sahara may not be equipped to handle complex or critical cases.

For foreigners, it is especially important to have a plan in place for emergency care, as the quality and availability of medical services can be limited. Many private hospitals and clinics have relationships with international insurance providers and can facilitate emergency evacuation if necessary. It is also recommended to research and identify reputable hospitals and clinics before arriving in Western Sahara, and to have a list of emergency contact numbers and services readily available.
