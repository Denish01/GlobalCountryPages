[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Western Sahara is characterized by the dominant use of Arabic, which is the language of government, education, and media. Berber, also known as **Tamazight**, is spoken by the indigenous Berber population and is recognized as an official language. Spanish and French are also widely spoken, particularly among the older population, due to the territory's history of colonization by Spain and its current administration by Morocco, which was a French protectorate. English proficiency is generally low, particularly outside of tourist areas and among older generations. The Arabic script is used to write Arabic, while Berber languages use the **Tifinagh** script or the Latin alphabet.

The regional dialects of Arabic spoken in Western Sahara are influenced by the territory's geographical location and its cultural exchange with neighboring countries. The **Hassaniya** dialect, which is also spoken in Mauritania and parts of Morocco, is commonly used in Western Sahara. Minority languages, such as **Zenaga**, are spoken by smaller communities, particularly in rural areas. English is not widely understood, and visitors may need to rely on translation tools or seek out English-speaking locals, particularly in the capital city of Laayoune.

The use of language in Western Sahara is often tied to social and cultural contexts. For example, Arabic is commonly used in formal settings, such as government offices and schools, while Berber languages may be used in more informal settings, such as family gatherings and traditional events. The language spoken can also vary depending on the region, with some areas having a stronger Berber influence and others having a more dominant Arabic influence.
