  "content": "The education system in Western Sahara is shaped by its complex history and disputed status, with a mix of Arabic and Berber influences, and is currently overseen by the Moroccan government, which claims sovereignty over the territory. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 50.2%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Arabic\nAcademic Calendar: September to June\nInternational Schools: limited\nTop University Ranking: ranked low globally due to limited resources and infrastructure\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Western Sahara is structured into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with primary education being compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 12. The quality of education varies, with public schools generally considered to be of lower quality than private schools, which are often expensive and inaccessible to many students. The curriculum is based on the Moroccan education system, with an emphasis on Arabic, Islamic studies, and mathematics. Despite efforts to improve education, the system faces significant challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers.\n\nThe tertiary education system in Western Sahara is limited, with few institutions offering higher education programs. The University of Ibn Zohr, which has a campus in Laayoune, is one of the main institutions of higher education in the territory. However, many students choose to pursue higher education in Morocco or other countries due to the limited options available in Western Sahara. The education system is also influenced by the cultural and linguistic diversity of the territory, with Berber and Arabic being the main languages spoken.\n\nThe education system in Western Sahara is also affected by the territory's disputed status, which has led to a lack of international recognition and limited access to international funding and resources. This has resulted in a brain drain, with many qualified educators and professionals leaving the territory to seek better opportunities elsewhere. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the education system, including initiatives to increase access to education, improve the quality of teaching, and promote vocational training.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
