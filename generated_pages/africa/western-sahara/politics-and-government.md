[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The political system in Western Sahara is characterized by a longstanding dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front, a Sahrawi nationalist movement. Morocco claims sovereignty over the entire territory, while the Polisario Front seeks independence. The **United Nations** has been involved in efforts to resolve the conflict, but a lasting solution has yet to be found. The separation of powers in Western Sahara is not clearly defined, as the territory is not recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. The Moroccan government exercises control over most of the territory, with a **unitary system** in place, while the Polisario Front administers the remaining areas, with a **presidential system**.

The political system in Western Sahara is also influenced by the **Arab League** and the **African Union**, which have both recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as a sovereign state. However, the international community is divided on the issue, with some countries recognizing Moroccan sovereignty and others supporting the Polisario Front's claim to independence. The **European Union** has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, while the **United States** has maintained a neutral stance.

The political landscape in Western Sahara is complex, with multiple actors and interests at play. The Moroccan government has invested heavily in the territory, with a focus on economic development and infrastructure projects. The Polisario Front, on the other hand, has maintained a strong military presence in the area, with support from Algeria and other regional allies. The **Sahrawi people** have been at the center of the conflict, with many displaced or refugees in neighboring countries.
