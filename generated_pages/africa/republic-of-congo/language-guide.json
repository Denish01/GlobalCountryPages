However, French is the dominant language and is used as the official language in government, education, and media. Kituba and Lingala are also widely spoken, particularly in the northern and southern regions of the country. English is not widely spoken, and visitors may find it challenging to communicate with locals who do not speak French. However, many people in the tourism industry, such as hotel staff and tour guides, may have some knowledge of English.\n\nThe linguistic landscape of the Republic of Congo is also characterized by the presence of regional dialects and minority languages. For example, the **Teke language** is spoken in the southeastern region of the country, while the **Kongo language** is spoken in the southwestern region. These languages are an important part of the country's cultural heritage and are still spoken by many people today.\n\nDespite the limited English proficiency, many Congolese people are eager to communicate with visitors and may use gestures and simple phrases to convey their message. Visitors who make an effort to speak French or learn a few basic phrases in the local language may find that it enhances their overall experience and helps to build connections with the local community.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Bonjour | bone-JOOR | formal |\n| Hello | Salut | sah-LOO | informal |\n| Thank you | Merci | mur-SEE |  |\n| Please | S'il vous plaît | see voo play |  |\n| Yes / No | Oui / Non | wee / nohn |  |\n| Excuse me | Excusez-moi | ex-KOO-zay mwah |  |\n| How much? | Combien ça coûte? | kohm-byehn sah koot |  |\n| Where is...? | Où est...? | oo eh |  |\n| I don't understand | Je ne comprends pas | zhuh nuh kohm-prehn pah |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Parlez-vous anglais? | pahr-lay voo ahng-lee |  |\n| Help! | Au secours! | oh suh-KOOR |  |\n| Goodbye | Au revoir | oh reh-VWAHR | formal |\n| Sorry | Pardon | pahr-DOHN |  |\n| How are you? | Comment allez-vous? | koh-mohn tah-leh voo | formal |\n| What's your name? | Comment vous appelez-vous? | koh-mohn voo ah-peh-lay voo | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Un | uhn |\n| 2 | Deux | duh |\n| 3 | Trois | twah |\n| 4 | Quatre | kah-tray |\n| 5 | Cinq | sank |\n| 6 | Six | sees |\n| 7 | Sept | seh |\n| 8 | Huit | wee |\n| 9 | Neuf | nuhf |\n| 10 | Dix | dees |\n| 100 | Cent | sahnt |\n| 1000 | Mille | mee-yay |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when communicating with locals, using formal titles such as **Monsieur** or **Madame**.\n- Use **body language** to convey friendliness and approachability, such as smiling and making eye contact.\n- Avoid using **gestures** that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the left hand or eating with the left hand.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in French, such as **bonjour** and **merci**, to show respect for the local culture.\n- Don't be afraid to **ask for help** if you need it, and be patient with locals who may not speak English.\n- Use **visual aids** such as maps and pictures to help communicate, especially when dealing with language barriers.\n- Be mindful of **cultural differences** and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about the local culture.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a **translation app** such as Google Translate to help with communication.\n- Carry a **phrasebook** or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a **language course** or use online resources to learn French before traveling to the Republic of Congo.\n- Use **online translation tools** such as translate.google.com to help with communication.\n- Consider hiring a **local guide** or tour operator who can provide translation services and help with communication.",
