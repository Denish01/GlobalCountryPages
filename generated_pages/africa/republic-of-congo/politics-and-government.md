[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Republic of Congo's government is based on a unitary presidential system, where the president serves as both the head of state and head of government. The president is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, with a limit of two terms. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by the president, who appoints a council of ministers to assist in governance. The legislative branch is bicameral, consisting of the Senate and the National Assembly, with members elected by popular vote. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts, with judges appointed by the president.

The separation of powers is enshrined in the constitution, with each branch having distinct roles and responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for implementing laws and policies, while the legislative branch is responsible for making laws. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the constitution. The system of government is designed to provide checks and balances, preventing any one branch from dominating the others.

The Republic of Congo has a **multi-party system**, with several parties represented in the legislature. However, the **Parti du Travail Congolais (PCT)**, led by President Denis Sassou Nguesso, has dominated politics since independence in 1960. The PCT has a strong presence in the government and has been accused of suppressing opposition and restricting civil liberties.
