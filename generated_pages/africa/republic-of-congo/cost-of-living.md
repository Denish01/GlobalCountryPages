[SECTION] How Expensive Is Republic of Congo? [/SECTION]
The Republic of Congo is a moderate to expensive country to visit or live in, especially when compared to other African nations. The cost of living in the Republic of Congo is influenced by its location, economy, and limited infrastructure. The country's economy is largely driven by the oil industry, which has led to a relatively high cost of living, particularly in the capital city of Brazzaville. Compared to its neighbors, the Republic of Congo is more expensive than the Democratic Republic of Congo, but less expensive than Gabon or Equatorial Guinea.

In general, visitors and expats can expect to pay a premium for accommodation, food, and transportation in the Republic of Congo. However, with some planning and research, it is possible to find affordable options and make the most of your budget. The local currency, the Central African CFA franc (XAF), is pegged to the Euro, which can make it easier for European visitors to manage their expenses.
