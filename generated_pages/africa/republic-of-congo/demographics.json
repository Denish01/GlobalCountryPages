The population growth rate is approximately 2.1%, with a median age of 19.5 years, indicating a relatively young population. The urban population accounts for around 66.7% of the total population, with many people migrating to cities such as Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire in search of better economic opportunities. The country's population density is relatively low, with an average of 18 people per km2, which is largely due to the vast areas of forest and savannah that cover much of the country.\n\nThe population of the Republic of Congo is also characterized by a high fertility rate, with an average of 4.5 children per woman, which is one of the highest in the world. This has contributed to the country's rapid population growth, but it also poses challenges in terms of providing adequate healthcare, education, and other social services to the growing population. The life expectancy in the Republic of Congo is approximately 64.6 years, which is lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Republic of Congo has also experienced significant migration patterns, with many people moving to urban areas in search of work and better living conditions. This has led to the growth of informal settlements and slums in cities, which often lack basic amenities such as access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. The government has implemented policies aimed at addressing these challenges, including the development of new urban planning strategies and the provision of social services to marginalized communities.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kongo | 48% | Southern and coastal regions | Largest ethnic group in the country |\n| Teke | 16.9% | Central and eastern regions | Traditionally skilled in agriculture and hunting |\n| Mbochi | 13.1% | Northern and eastern regions | Known for their expertise in fishing and trade |\n| Sangha | 5.6% | Northern region | Traditionally nomadic people with a strong cultural heritage |\n| Bakongo | 3.8% | Southern region | Skilled in farming and craftsmanship |\n| PYGMY | 1.4% | Forest regions | Indigenous people with a unique cultural identity |\n[/TABLE]\nThe Republic of Congo is home to a diverse range of ethnic groups, with the Kongo people being the largest group, accounting for approximately 48% of the population.
