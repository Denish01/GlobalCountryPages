The public healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Population, which provides free or low-cost healthcare services to citizens, including vaccinations, maternal and child healthcare, and treatment for infectious diseases. However, the quality of care and access to facilities can be limited, especially in rural areas, where many people rely on traditional healers and community-based healthcare. The private healthcare sector is mainly concentrated in urban areas, such as Brazzaville, and offers higher-quality care, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the average citizen.\n\nThe quality of care in the Republic of Congo is a major concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment, medication, and trained personnel. The country also faces a significant shortage of healthcare workers, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country to work abroad. This has resulted in a significant burden on the existing healthcare system, making it difficult for people to access quality care. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities.\n\nThe urban-rural divide in healthcare access is also a significant issue in the Republic of Congo. While urban areas such as Brazzaville have a higher concentration of healthcare facilities and trained personnel, rural areas often lack even basic healthcare services. This can make it difficult for people in rural areas to access quality care, especially in emergency situations. The government has made efforts to address this issue, including the deployment of community health workers to rural areas and the establishment of mobile health clinics.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brazzaville | Brazzaville | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinique de la Source | Brazzaville | Private | General medicine, cardiology, oncology | Yes |\n| Hôpital de Makelekele | Brazzaville | Public | General medicine, maternity, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinique des Nations | Brazzaville | Private | General medicine, surgery, dentistry | Yes |\n| Hôpital de Dolisie | Dolisie | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinique Saint-Luc | Pointe-Noire | Private | General medicine, cardiology, oncology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- The government of the Republic of Congo has introduced a national health insurance scheme, which provides coverage for citizens and residents\n- Private health insurance is also available, but can be expensive and may not cover all medical expenses\n- Expatriates and foreigners are recommended to have private health insurance that covers them globally, including in the Republic of Congo\n- Local insurance options may not provide adequate coverage for serious medical conditions or evacuation to a foreign country\n- The cost of health insurance in the Republic of Congo can vary widely, depending on the provider and the level of coverage\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are available in urban areas, but can be limited in rural areas\n- Prescription requirements vary, but many medications can be obtained over-the-counter\n- Common brands of medications are available, but may not always be up-to-date or authentic\n- The cost of medications can be high, especially for imported brands\n- Patients are often required to pay out-of-pocket for medications, even in public healthcare facilities\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- The Republic of Congo requires visitors to have vaccinations against **yellow fever**, **HIV**, and **hepatitis A**\n- Recommended vaccinations include **hepatitis B**, **rabies**, and **meningitis**\n- The country is at risk for **malaria**, **tuberculosis**, and **HIV/AIDS**\n- Water safety is a concern, and visitors are recommended to drink bottled or filtered water\n- Food safety is also a concern, and visitors are recommended to avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- The Republic of Congo is not a major destination for medical tourism, due to the limited availability of quality healthcare facilities\n- However, some private clinics and hospitals in Brazzaville and other urban areas may offer specialized medical services, such as **cardiology** and **oncology**\n- Accredited hospitals and clinics may offer cost savings for certain medical procedures, but this is not always the case\n- Patients are recommended to research thoroughly and consult with their insurance provider before seeking medical care in the Republic of Congo\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an emergency, visitors are recommended to call the emergency number, 15, or seek assistance from a local hospital or clinic\n- Ambulance services are limited, and may not be available in rural areas\n- The nearest hospital or clinic may not always have the necessary equipment or trained personnel to handle emergency situations\n- Visitors are recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuation, including a reliable means of transportation and communication\n- Insurance claims can be complicated, and visitors are recommended to have all necessary documentation and contact information for their insurance provider.",
