# Republic of Congo Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Republic of Congo is still developing, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 45% of population
Internet Penetration: 17%
Road Network: 17,000 km, poor to moderate quality
Rail Network: 900 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Republic of Congo's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas. The country has made efforts to invest in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving transportation networks, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, much work remains to be done to address the country's infrastructure gaps, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation is limited. The government has implemented several initiatives to attract private investment and improve the business environment, which is expected to boost economic growth and drive infrastructure development.

The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its landlocked location, which increases the cost of transporting goods and services. Additionally, the Republic of Congo's infrastructure is vulnerable to natural disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, which can cause significant damage to roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the government is committed to improving the country's infrastructure, and several major projects are currently underway, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure access is a significant challenge in the Republic of Congo. While cities such as Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire have relatively well-developed infrastructure, including paved roads, reliable electricity, and access to clean water, rural areas often lack these basic services. This can make it difficult for people in rural areas to access healthcare, education, and other essential services, which can exacerbate poverty and inequality.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- The Republic of Congo's energy sector is dominated by **hydroelectric power**, which accounts for over 90% of the country's electricity generation.
- The country's energy generation capacity is limited, resulting in frequent **power outages**, particularly in rural areas.
- The government is investing in **renewable energy**, including solar and wind power, to reduce the country's reliance on hydroelectric power and improve energy security.
- The **reliability of the power supply** is a significant concern, with many households and businesses relying on backup generators to ensure a stable power supply.
- The country is also exploring **oil and gas** production, which is expected to increase the country's energy generation capacity and reduce its reliance on imports.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern in the Republic of Congo, with many households relying on alternative sources of water, such as wells and rivers.
- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, particularly in rural areas, where many households lack access to basic sanitation facilities.
- The government is investing in **water supply infrastructure**, including new water treatment plants and distribution networks, to improve access to clean water.
- **Water access in rural areas** is a significant challenge, with many households relying on traditional sources of water, such as wells and springs.
- The country is also promoting **hygiene and sanitation** practices, including handwashing and proper waste disposal, to reduce the risk of water-borne diseases.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread in the Republic of Congo, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.
- **Fiber-optic networks** are being rolled out in major cities, including Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, to improve internet speeds and reliability.
- The government is investing in **4G and 5G networks** to improve mobile broadband services and support the growth of the digital economy.
- **Postal services** are limited, with many households relying on private courier services to send and receive mail and packages.
- The country is also promoting **digital literacy** and **e-government** initiatives to improve access to public services and promote economic development.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The government is investing in a **new highway** connecting Brazzaville to Pointe-Noire, which is expected to improve transportation links and boost economic growth.
- The **Djoum Dam** project is a major hydroelectric power project that is expected to increase the country's energy generation capacity and reduce its reliance on imports.
- The **Pointe-Noire Port** expansion project is expected to increase the port's capacity and improve the efficiency of cargo handling and logistics services.
- The government is also investing in **rural infrastructure development**, including new roads, bridges, and water supply systems, to improve access to basic services in rural areas.
- The **Central African Backbone** project is a regional initiative to improve telecommunications infrastructure and promote digital connectivity across the region.
