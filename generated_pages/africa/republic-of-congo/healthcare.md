[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Republic of Congo's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a significant portion of the population relying on traditional medicine and community-based healthcare. The public healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Population, which provides free or low-cost healthcare services to citizens, including vaccinations, maternal and child healthcare, and treatment for infectious diseases. However, the quality of care and access to facilities can be limited, especially in rural areas, where many people rely on traditional healers and community-based healthcare. The private healthcare sector is mainly concentrated in urban areas, such as Brazzaville, and offers higher-quality care, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the average citizen.

The quality of care in the Republic of Congo is a major concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment, medication, and trained personnel. The country also faces a significant shortage of healthcare workers, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country to work abroad. This has resulted in a significant burden on the existing healthcare system, making it difficult for people to access quality care. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities.

The urban-rural divide in healthcare access is also a significant issue in the Republic of Congo. While urban areas such as Brazzaville have a higher concentration of healthcare facilities and trained personnel, rural areas often lack even basic healthcare services. This can make it difficult for people in rural areas to access quality care, especially in emergency situations. The government has made efforts to address this issue, including the deployment of community health workers to rural areas and the establishment of mobile health clinics.
