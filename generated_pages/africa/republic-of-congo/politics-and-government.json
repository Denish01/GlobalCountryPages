The president is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, with a limit of two terms. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by the president, who appoints a council of ministers to assist in governance. The legislative branch is bicameral, consisting of the Senate and the National Assembly, with members elected by popular vote. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts, with judges appointed by the president.\n\nThe separation of powers is enshrined in the constitution, with each branch having distinct roles and responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for implementing laws and policies, while the legislative branch is responsible for making laws. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the constitution. The system of government is designed to provide checks and balances, preventing any one branch from dominating the others.\n\nThe Republic of Congo has a **multi-party system**, with several parties represented in the legislature. However, the **Parti du Travail Congolais (PCT)**, led by President Denis Sassou Nguesso, has dominated politics since independence in 1960. The PCT has a strong presence in the government and has been accused of suppressing opposition and restricting civil liberties.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Denis Sassou Nguesso | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Prime Minister Anatole Collinet Makosso | Assists the president in governance |\n| Legislative | Senate | Senate President Pierre Ngolo | Upper house of parliament |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | National Assembly President Isidore Mvouba | Lower house of parliament |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Interprets laws and ensures constitutional compliance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Parti du Travail Congolais (PCT) | Center-left | President Denis Sassou Nguesso | 89 | Dominant party since independence |\n| Union Panafricaine pour la Démocratie Sociale (UPADS) | Center-left | Pascal Tsaty Mabiala | 12 | Main opposition party |\n| Rassemblement pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (RDPS) | Center-right | Jean-Pierre Thystère Tchicaya | 5 | Opposition party |\n| Union des Démocrates Humanistes (UDH-YUKI) | Center | Guy-Rolland Niemba | 4 | Opposition party |\n| Convention pour le Développement du Congo (CDC) | Center-right | Bernard Bakana | 3 | Opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in the Republic of Congo is based on a **majoritarian system**, with the president and members of the legislature elected by popular vote.\n- Elections are held every five years for the president and the National Assembly, and every six years for the Senate.\n- The last presidential election was held in 2016, with President Denis Sassou Nguesso winning re-election with 60% of the vote.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled for 2026, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The Republic of Congo has experienced **periods of instability** since independence, including a civil war in the 1990s and a disputed election in 2016.\n- The country faces **significant development challenges**, including poverty, corruption, and poor infrastructure.\n- The government has been accused of **human rights abuses**, including restrictions on civil liberties and suppression of opposition.\n- The Republic of Congo is ranked 123 out of 178 countries in terms of **political stability**, according to the World Bank.\n- The country has a **high level of corruption**, ranking 129 out of 180 countries, according to Transparency International.\n- The government has implemented **reforms** aimed at improving governance and reducing corruption, but more needs to be done to address these challenges.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- The Republic of Congo is a member of the **United Nations** and the **African Union**, and has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries.\n- The country has **strong ties** with France, its former colonial power, and has received significant economic and military aid from France.\n- The Republic of Congo is also a member of the **Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)** and the **Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC)**.\n- The country has **good relations** with its neighbors, including Gabon and Cameroon, and has participated in regional initiatives to promote peace and stability in Central Africa.\n- The Republic of Congo has **diplomatic tensions** with the Democratic Republic of Congo, with which it has a long-standing border dispute.",
