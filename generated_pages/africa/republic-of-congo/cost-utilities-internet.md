[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The Republic of Congo has a relatively underdeveloped utility infrastructure, with frequent power outages and water shortages, especially in rural areas. The costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the dry season due to increased demand. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the progress is slow, and the costs remain relatively high.

The utility costs in the Republic of Congo are also affected by the inflation rate, which is currently at 3.1%. This means that the costs of utilities can increase over time, making it essential for residents to budget accordingly. Additionally, the country's GDP per capita PPP is $7,026, which is relatively low, making it challenging for many residents to afford basic utilities.
