Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction is **French**, and education is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 16. The school system is modeled after the French system, with a focus on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language.\n\nThe availability of international schools in Republic of Congo is limited, with most options being found in the capital city of **Brazzaville**.
