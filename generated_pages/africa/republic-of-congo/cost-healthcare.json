  "content": "The cost of healthcare in the Republic of Congo can vary significantly depending on the type of care and whether you choose public or private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $76.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $76 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: varies, but can be high for some services\nHealthcare System: Mixed (Public and Private)\nEmergency Number: 15\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XAF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Republic of Congo has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available. Public healthcare facilities are generally less expensive, but may offer lower quality care and longer wait times. Private facilities, on the other hand, offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, due to the high cost of private care. For foreigners, private facilities are often the preferred choice, due to the higher quality of care and shorter wait times. Insurance is not required, but it is highly recommended, as medical costs can be high and unpredictable.\n\nThe healthcare system in the Republic of Congo is not well-developed, and medical facilities and equipment may be limited, especially outside of the capital city of Brazzaville. Additionally, many medical professionals may not speak English, which can create a language barrier for foreigners. Despite these challenges, there are some high-quality private facilities available, especially in Brazzaville, that offer a range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures. It is essential to research and find a reputable facility before seeking medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | prices vary by specialty and city |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | prices vary by city and dentist |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | prices vary by city and optometrist |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$30 | $50-$100 | prices vary by city and lab |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | prices vary by hospital and city |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | prices vary by hospital and city |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | prices vary by procedure and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,500 | prices vary by hospital and city |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | prices vary by hospital and city |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | prices vary by hospital and city |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | covers medical services worldwide, including evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** can be expensive, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 or more per month, depending on the medication and pharmacy.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are generally less expensive, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 or more per month, depending on the medication and pharmacy.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Prescription rules** vary, but many medications are available without a prescription.\n- **Common medications**, such as antibiotics and pain relievers, are widely available, but may be more expensive than in other countries.\n- **Vaccinations** are available, but may be limited in rural areas, and prices vary depending on the type of vaccination and provider.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek help as quickly as possible. The emergency number in the Republic of Congo is 15, and ambulances are available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek medical care at a private facility, as they often have better equipment and more experienced medical staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Brazzaville include the **Centre Hospitalier Universitaire** and the **Clinique des Nations**, which offer a range of medical services, including emergency care and specialist consultations. It is also a good idea to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuations, as the quality of medical care in the Republic of Congo may not be up to international standards.",
