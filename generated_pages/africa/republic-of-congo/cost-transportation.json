The quality of public transit is generally poor, with limited coverage and frequent breakdowns. However, the country is investing in improving its transportation infrastructure, including the development of new roads and bridges. In the capital city of Brazzaville, the most common mode of transportation is by **minibus** or **taxi**, while in rural areas, people often rely on **bicycles** or **motorcycles**.\n\nThe lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people have to rely on **private vehicles** or **informal transportation** to get around. This can be expensive and time-consuming, especially for those living in rural areas. However, the government is working to improve the transportation network, including the development of new bus routes and the introduction of **ride-hailing apps**. These apps have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering a convenient and affordable way to get around the city.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, frequent breakdowns |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Extensive network, variable prices |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2-$5 | $1-$2 | $5-$10 | Variable prices, negotiate before riding |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$5 | $1-$2 | $5-$10 | Taxibike, MUBAO, and other apps available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, variable prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00-$1.30 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$100 | Economy car, prices vary depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$5 | Limited parking options, prices vary |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, prices vary |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | Variable prices, limited comfort |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$300 | Typical route, prices vary depending on airline |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are often cheaper than **taxis** or **ride-hailing apps**.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Taxibike or MUBAO to get around the city, as they offer a convenient and affordable way to get around.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a **taxi** or **minibus**, as prices can vary significantly.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or when using **public transportation**.\n- Consider renting a **car** for long-distance trips, as this can be more convenient and affordable than using **public transportation**.\n- Use **local currency** (XAF) when possible, as this can help you avoid high exchange rates and fees.",
