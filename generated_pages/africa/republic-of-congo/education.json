Primary education, also known as **enseignement primaire**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12 and lasts for 6 years. Secondary education, or **enseignement secondaire**, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for 4 years, and the second cycle lasts for 3 years. Tertiary education, or **enseignement supérieur**, includes universities and other higher education institutions that offer a range of academic programs. The quality of education in the Republic of Congo is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on **French language** and **literature**. However, there are significant disparities between public and private schools, with private schools generally offering better facilities and more qualified teachers.\n\nThe public education system in the Republic of Congo is free and compulsory for all children, but it faces significant challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools are generally better equipped and offer a higher quality of education, but they are often expensive and inaccessible to many students. Despite these challenges, the Republic of Congo has made significant progress in recent years in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and women. The government has implemented a range of initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education, including teacher training programs and infrastructure development projects.\n\nOverall, the education system in the Republic of Congo is complex and multifaceted, with both public and private schools offering a range of educational opportunities. While there are significant challenges to be addressed, the system has the potential to provide students with a high-quality education and prepare them for success in a rapidly changing world.
