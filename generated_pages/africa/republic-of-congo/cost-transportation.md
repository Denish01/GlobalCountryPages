[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Republic of Congo has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **informal transportation** such as minibuses and shared taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with limited coverage and frequent breakdowns. However, the country is investing in improving its transportation infrastructure, including the development of new roads and bridges. In the capital city of Brazzaville, the most common mode of transportation is by **minibus** or **taxi**, while in rural areas, people often rely on **bicycles** or **motorcycles**.

The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people have to rely on **private vehicles** or **informal transportation** to get around. This can be expensive and time-consuming, especially for those living in rural areas. However, the government is working to improve the transportation network, including the development of new bus routes and the introduction of **ride-hailing apps**. These apps have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering a convenient and affordable way to get around the city.
