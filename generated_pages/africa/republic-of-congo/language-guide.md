The Republic of Congo is a **linguistically diverse** country, with over 60 languages spoken across its territory. However, French is the dominant language and is used as the official language in government, education, and media. Kituba and Lingala are also widely spoken, particularly in the northern and southern regions of the country.

However, many people in the tourism industry, such as hotel staff and tour guides, may have some knowledge of English.

The linguistic landscape of the Republic of Congo is also characterized by the presence of regional dialects and minority languages.

These languages are an important part of the country's cultural heritage and are still spoken by many people today.

Despite the limited English proficiency, many Congolese people are eager to communicate with visitors and may use gestures and simple phrases to convey their message.
