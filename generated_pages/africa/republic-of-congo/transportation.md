The Republic of Congo has two main international airports: Maya-Maya Airport in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire Airport, which receive flights from major African and European cities. Direct flights to Brazzaville are available from Paris, Brussels, and several African capitals. Overland entry points are available from neighboring countries, including Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and Gabon. However, traveling overland can be challenging due to the poor road conditions and potential security concerns.

For those traveling from neighboring countries, there are several border crossings, including the ones at Ouesso, Semliki, and Dolisie. It is essential to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations before embarking on your journey. Additionally, consider the time of year and potential weather conditions that may affect road travel. The dry season, from May to October, is generally the best time to travel overland.
