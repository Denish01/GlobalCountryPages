The **inflation rate** of 3.1% in 2024 also contributes to the increasing cost of food. Eating out is not a common practice among locals, as home cooking is preferred due to the high cost of restaurant meals. However, in urban areas like Brazzaville, there is a growing trend of mid-range restaurants catering to the increasing middle class. The **GDP per capita PPP** of $7,026 in 2024 indicates a relatively stable economy, which can support a moderate level of food expenditure.\n\nThe cost of food in the Republic of Congo is driven by various factors, including transportation costs, import duties, and limited local production. The country relies heavily on imports, which increases the cost of food staples like rice, wheat, and dairy products. Additionally, the lack of infrastructure and limited access to markets in rural areas contribute to higher food prices. However, the government's efforts to improve **education spend** and **health expenditure** may have a positive impact on the overall well-being of the population, including their access to nutritious food.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 1,375 XAF | Imported from Europe |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | 825 XAF | Local production |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 1,100 XAF | Local farms |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 660 XAF | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 3,300 XAF | Local farms |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 5,500 XAF | Imported from Brazil |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.50 | 1,925 XAF | Imported from South Africa |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 825 XAF | Local production |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 550 XAF | Local production |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 440 XAF | Local production |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 4,400 XAF | Limited production |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 550 XAF | Local brand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 | Traditional dishes like poulet nyembwe |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-15 | One person, local cuisine |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-30 | 3 courses, international cuisine |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-70 | Upscale, French-inspired cuisine |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-3 | Brewed in Congo |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-5 | European brands |\n| Cappuccino | $3-4 | Coffee shops in Brazzaville |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | International brands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in the Republic of Congo can be significant. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive due to the cost of maintaining a physical store, importing products, and providing a wider range of goods. On the other hand, local markets offer fresher produce at lower prices, but the quality and variety may vary. It is recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported products.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, bargaining is a common practice, and visitors should be prepared to negotiate prices. The key is to be respectful and polite, as the vendors are often small-scale farmers or traders. It is also essential to check the quality and freshness of the products before purchasing. In contrast, supermarkets usually have fixed prices, and bargaining is not an option. However, some supermarkets may offer discounts or promotions, especially on imported goods.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in the Republic of Congo is to buy street food or cook at home using local ingredients.\n- Local staples like **poulet nyembwe** (chicken with peanuts) and **liboke** (steamed fish in leaves) are good value and delicious.\n- Fresh produce like fruits and vegetables are relatively cheap and abundant at local markets.\n- It is recommended to avoid buying imported goods, as they can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local products.\n- **Fufu**, a traditional dish made from cassava or plantains, is a staple in Congolese cuisine and can be found at a low cost in local markets.\n- Visitors should also try **kwanga**, a traditional dish made from fermented cassava, which is a good source of nutrients and can be purchased at a reasonable price.",
