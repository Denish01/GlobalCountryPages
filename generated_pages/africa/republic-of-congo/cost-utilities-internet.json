The costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the dry season due to increased demand. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the progress is slow, and the costs remain relatively high.\n\nThe utility costs in the Republic of Congo are also affected by the inflation rate, which is currently at 3.1%. This means that the costs of utilities can increase over time, making it essential for residents to budget accordingly. Additionally, the country's GDP per capita PPP is $7,026, which is relatively low, making it challenging for many residents to afford basic utilities.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in rent or separate |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | MTN, Airtel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 60 Mbps | MTN, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | MTN, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | MTN, Airtel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | MTN, Airtel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in English and French |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in English and French |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited content availability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents typically need to provide identification and proof of address, and pay a deposit, which can range from $50 to $100.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help residents budget and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in the Republic of Congo are MTN and Airtel, which offer relatively fast and reliable connections.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transportation or walk/bike when possible.\n- It is essential to research and compares prices before choosing a utility provider, as prices can vary significantly depending on the provider and location.",
