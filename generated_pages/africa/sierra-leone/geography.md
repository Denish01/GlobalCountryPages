[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Sierra Leone is a sovereign country located in West Africa, bordered by Guinea to the north and east, and Liberia to the southeast. The country has a coastline along the Atlantic Ocean to the west, with the Sierra Leone Peninsula forming part of the coastline. The capital city, Freetown, is situated on the peninsula and serves as the country's main port and commercial center. Sierra Leone's strategic location on the Atlantic coast made it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region.

The country's borders with Guinea and Liberia are defined by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries. The border with Guinea is largely defined by the Koindou and Makona rivers, while the border with Liberia is marked by the Mano River. Sierra Leone's coastline is approximately 402 kilometers long, with a number of bays, inlets, and islands, including the Sierra Leone Peninsula and the Turtle Islands. The country's unique geography has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy.

Sierra Leone's terrain is diverse and varied, with a range of landscapes that include mountains, forests, and coastal plains. The country's highest point, Mount Bintumani, is located in the Loma Mountains in the north, which form part of the Guinea Highlands. The mountains are covered in dense forest and are home to a variety of flora and fauna, including several endangered species. The western part of the country is dominated by the Sierra Leone Peninsula, which is a narrow strip of land that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean.

The interior of the country is characterized by a series of plateaus and valleys, with the Sewa River and its tributaries flowing through the eastern part of the country. The coastal plains are generally low-lying and swampy, with a number of rivers and streams flowing into the ocean. The country's forests are an important part of its ecosystem, providing habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including elephants, chimpanzees, and monkeys. However, deforestation and land degradation are major concerns, with many of the country's forests being cleared for agriculture and other purposes.

The country's coastline is also an important feature of its landscape, with a number of beautiful beaches and coastal towns. The Sierra Leone Peninsula is home to several popular beaches, including Lumley Beach and Lakka Beach, which are known for their white sand and crystal-clear waters. The coastline is also an important hub for fishing and trade, with many of the country's major ports and fishing villages located along the coast.
