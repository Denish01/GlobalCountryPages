[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Sierra Leone are generally higher than the regional average, driven up by factors such as transportation costs, import duties, and a reliance on imported goods. The country's economy has been affected by high inflation rates, with a current rate of 28.6%, which has contributed to the increase in food prices. Despite this, eating out is a common practice in Sierra Leone, particularly in the capital city of Freetown, where a variety of local and international restaurants can be found. However, for many locals, home cooking remains the primary source of nutrition, with traditional dishes such as **jollof rice**, **fufu**, and **groundnut stew** being staples of the Sierra Leonean diet.

The eating-out culture in Sierra Leone is influenced by the country's cultural diversity, with a mix of traditional, African, and international cuisines available. However, the high cost of eating out means that it is often reserved for special occasions or for those with higher incomes. In contrast, home cooking allows individuals to prepare meals at a lower cost, using locally sourced ingredients and traditional recipes. This approach not only helps to reduce food expenses but also promotes the use of local produce and supports the local economy.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, Sierra Leoneans have the option of choosing between supermarkets and local markets. While supermarkets offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, local markets provide a more affordable and traditional shopping experience. The prices at local markets are generally lower, with vendors often willing to negotiate and offer discounts for bulk purchases. However, the quality and variety of products may vary, and buyers need to be cautious when purchasing perishable items.
