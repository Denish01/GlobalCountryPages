[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Sierra Leone is growing, driven by a combination of government investment in infrastructure and a rising middle class. The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional housing, with a strong demand for rentals in urban areas. The capital city, Freetown, is the hub of commercial and economic activity, and as such, it is the most sought-after location for property investment. However, other cities such as Makeni and Bo are also attracting attention from investors due to their growing economies and relatively lower prices. The price trajectory of the property market in Sierra Leone has been on an upward trend in recent years, with prices increasing by up to 10% per annum in some areas.

The urban-rural divide is also a significant factor in the property market, with urban areas such as Freetown and Makeni experiencing faster growth and higher prices compared to rural areas. The government has implemented initiatives to encourage investment in rural areas, such as the provision of subsidies for housing development and the improvement of infrastructure. Despite these efforts, the rural property market remains relatively underdeveloped, with limited access to amenities and services. However, for investors looking for affordable options, rural areas may offer opportunities for growth and development.

The current market conditions in Sierra Leone are characterized by a shortage of high-quality housing, particularly in urban areas. This has led to an increase in prices and rents, making it challenging for locals and foreigners alike to find affordable accommodation. However, the government has launched initiatives to address this shortage, including the development of new housing estates and the renovation of existing properties. These initiatives are expected to increase the supply of housing and help to stabilize prices in the medium term.
