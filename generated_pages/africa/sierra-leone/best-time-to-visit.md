[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Sierra Leone has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C. The wet season, which runs from May to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 25°C. The dry season is the best time to visit Sierra Leone, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, surfing, and exploring the country's beautiful beaches and national parks.

The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as the heavy rainfall can cause flooding and make roads impassable. However, the wet season is also a time of great beauty, as the countryside is lush and green, and the waterfalls are at their most spectacular. The country's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the coastal regions being generally hotter and more humid than the interior.

The seasons in Sierra Leone also affect the country's wildlife and vegetation. During the dry season, the wildlife tends to congregate around water sources, making it easier to spot animals such as elephants, lions, and leopards. The wet season, on the other hand, is a time of abundance, with the countryside teeming with life and the markets filled with fresh produce.
