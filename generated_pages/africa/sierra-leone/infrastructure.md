# Sierra Leone Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Sierra Leone is still developing, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 34.6% of population
Internet Penetration: 11.6%
Road Network: 11,300 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 1 international, 2 domestic
Major Ports: 1 major
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Sierra Leone's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in the energy, transportation, and water sectors. However, the urban-rural gap remains a major challenge, with most basic services concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural communities with limited access to essential infrastructure. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural roads and the expansion of electricity and water services to rural areas. Despite these efforts, much work remains to be done to bridge the infrastructure gap and provide equitable access to basic services for all citizens.

The government has also invested in the development of key infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities. These investments are expected to improve the overall quality of life for citizens and support economic growth. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, limited institutional capacity, and a high risk of natural disasters, which can undermine infrastructure development efforts.

Sierra Leone's infrastructure development is also hindered by the legacy of the civil war, which destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and displaced large segments of the population. The country is still recovering from the effects of the war, and the reconstruction of infrastructure is an ongoing process. The government has made significant progress in recent years, but much work remains to be done to restore and upgrade the country's infrastructure to meet the needs of its growing population.
