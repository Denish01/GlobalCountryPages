[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Sierra Leone is a relatively affordable country to live in, with a low cost of living compared to other countries in West Africa. The GDP per capita (PPP) of $3,522 indicates that the country has a relatively low standard of living, but it also means that the cost of living is lower. A budget of $400-600 per month can go a long way in Sierra Leone, covering basic expenses such as rent, food, and transportation. However, for a more comfortable lifestyle, a budget of $1,500-2,500 per month would be more suitable, allowing for luxuries such as eating out, entertainment, and travel. Compared to neighboring countries, Sierra Leone is more affordable than Guinea but more expensive than Liberia.

The cost of living in Sierra Leone can vary greatly depending on the location, with Freetown being the most expensive city. However, even in Freetown, the cost of living is relatively low compared to other major cities in West Africa. The high inflation rate of 28.6% can make it challenging to budget, as prices can rise quickly. Additionally, the low education spend of 2.6% of GDP and the high out-of-pocket health spend of 54.5% can make it difficult for individuals to access quality healthcare and education. Despite these challenges, Sierra Leone can be a great destination for digital nomads, retirees, and students looking for an affordable and culturally rich experience.
