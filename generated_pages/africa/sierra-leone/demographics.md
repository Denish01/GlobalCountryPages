[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Sierra Leone has a relatively large population, with an estimated 9 million people, which is expected to continue growing at a rate of 2.4% per annum. The country's population is characterized by a high proportion of young people, with a median age of 19.4 years, and a significant urban population, with approximately 42% of the population residing in urban areas. The population density is relatively high, with an average of 126 people per square kilometer. The country's population growth rate is driven by a high total fertility rate of 4.3 children per woman, which is one of the highest in the world.

The population of Sierra Leone is also characterized by significant migration patterns, both within the country and across international borders. Many Sierra Leoneans have migrated to other countries in search of better economic opportunities, while others have been displaced by conflict and natural disasters. The country's urban population is growing rapidly, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of employment and better living conditions. This trend is expected to continue, with the urban population projected to increase significantly in the coming years.

Despite the challenges posed by rapid population growth, Sierra Leone has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards in recent years. The country has implemented various development programs aimed at reducing poverty, improving healthcare and education, and promoting economic growth. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant development challenges facing the country, including high levels of poverty, limited access to basic services, and significant infrastructure deficits.
