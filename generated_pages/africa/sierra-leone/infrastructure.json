  "content": "The infrastructure in Sierra Leone is still developing, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 34.6% of population\nInternet Penetration: 11.6%\nRoad Network: 11,300 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1 international, 2 domestic\nMajor Ports: 1 major\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSierra Leone's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in the energy, transportation, and water sectors. However, the urban-rural gap remains a major challenge, with most basic services concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural communities with limited access to essential infrastructure. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural roads and the expansion of electricity and water services to rural areas. Despite these efforts, much work remains to be done to bridge the infrastructure gap and provide equitable access to basic services for all citizens.\n\nThe government has also invested in the development of key infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities. These investments are expected to improve the overall quality of life for citizens and support economic growth. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, limited institutional capacity, and a high risk of natural disasters, which can undermine infrastructure development efforts.\n\nSierra Leone's infrastructure development is also hindered by the legacy of the civil war, which destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and displaced large segments of the population. The country is still recovering from the effects of the war, and the reconstruction of infrastructure is an ongoing process. The government has made significant progress in recent years, but much work remains to be done to restore and upgrade the country's infrastructure to meet the needs of its growing population.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 11,300 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved, with significant maintenance needs |\n| Railways | none | - | No railway network in the country |\n| Airports | 1 international, 2 domestic | Moderate | Limited international connections, with most flights to regional destinations |\n| Ports | 1 major | Good | The port of Freetown is the country's main port, with significant cargo handling capacity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main sources of power generation in Sierra Leone are **thermal** and **hydroelectric** power plants, with a total installed capacity of approximately 200 MW.\n- The country's energy sector is characterized by frequent **power outages** and a lack of reliable electricity supply, particularly in rural areas.\n- The government has made significant investments in the development of **renewable energy** sources, including solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and improve energy security.\n- The **rural electrification** program aims to provide electricity access to rural communities, with a focus on off-grid solutions such as solar home systems and mini-grids.\n- The country's energy sector is also supported by regional initiatives, including the **West Africa Power Pool**, which aims to promote regional energy cooperation and improve energy security.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern in Sierra Leone, with many communities lacking access to safe and reliable drinking water.\n- The country's **sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many households lacking access to improved sanitation facilities, particularly in rural areas.\n- The government has made significant investments in the development of **rural water supply** systems, including the construction of new wells, boreholes, and water treatment plants.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a major challenge, with many communities relying on traditional sources such as rivers, streams, and wells.\n- The country's **water sector** is also supported by international organizations, including the **United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)**, which provides technical and financial assistance to improve water and sanitation services.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread in Sierra Leone, with most of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- The country's **fiber optic network** is limited, with most internet services provided through satellite or wireless connections.\n- The **4G rollout** has been slow, with limited coverage in rural areas, but the government has made significant investments in the development of **broadband infrastructure**.\n- **Postal services** are limited in Sierra Leone, with most mail and package services provided by private companies.\n- The government has also made significant investments in the development of **information and communication technology (ICT)** infrastructure, including the establishment of a national ICT policy and the development of e-government services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Sierra Leone Energy Sector Reform Project** aims to improve the country's energy sector by promoting private sector participation and increasing access to electricity.\n- The **Freetown-Waterloo Highway Project** aims to improve road connectivity between Freetown and the surrounding areas, with a focus on reducing traffic congestion and improving road safety.\n- The **Sierra Leone Water Sector Reform Project** aims to improve the country's water sector by promoting private sector participation and increasing access to safe and reliable drinking water.\n- The **West Africa Regional Transport Project** aims to improve regional transport connectivity, with a focus on promoting trade and economic integration.\n- The **Sierra Leone Telecommunications Sector Reform Project** aims to improve the country's telecommunications sector by promoting private sector participation and increasing access to ICT services.",
