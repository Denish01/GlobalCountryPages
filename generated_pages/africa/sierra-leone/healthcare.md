[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Sierra Leone is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering services. The public sector is the main provider of healthcare services, with a network of government-owned hospitals and health centers across the country. However, the quality of care in public facilities is often compromised due to inadequate funding, lack of equipment, and shortages of skilled healthcare professionals. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality services, but at a higher cost, making them inaccessible to many Sierra Leoneans. Urban areas, such as Freetown, have a higher concentration of healthcare providers and better-equipped facilities, while rural areas often struggle with limited access to healthcare services.

The government of Sierra Leone has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of free healthcare for pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children under five. However, the system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to essential medicines. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent healthcare facilities in Sierra Leone, particularly in Freetown, which offer high-quality care to those who can afford it.

The quality of care in Sierra Leone's healthcare system is a major concern, with many facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies. Additionally, the country has a high burden of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, which puts a strain on the healthcare system. To address these challenges, the government and international partners are working to strengthen the healthcare system, including investing in healthcare infrastructure, training healthcare professionals, and improving access to essential medicines.
