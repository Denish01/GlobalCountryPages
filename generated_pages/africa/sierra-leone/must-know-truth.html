        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Sierra Leone, a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in <strong>Africa</strong>, has a rich and complex history. The area was first inhabited by indigenous peoples, including the <strong>Limba</strong>, <strong>Mende</strong>, and <strong>Temne</strong> tribes. In the 15th century, Portuguese explorers arrived, and the country became a major hub for the <strong>transatlantic slave trade</strong>. In 1787, the British established the <strong>Province of Freedom</strong>, a settlement for freed slaves, which would eventually become the city of <strong>Freetown</strong>, the capital of Sierra Leone. The country was formally colonized by Britain in 1808, and it remained a British colony until <strong>April 27, 1961</strong>, when it gained independence.</p>
        <p>The early years of independence were marked by political instability, with <strong>Sir Milton Margai</strong> serving as the country's first prime minister. In 1967, <strong>Siaka Stevens</strong> came to power, and he would go on to rule the country for over a decade. During the 1990s, Sierra Leone was embroiled in a <strong>civil war</strong>, which lasted from 1991 to 2002 and resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people. The war was fought between the government and the <strong>Revolutionary United Front (RUF)</strong>, a rebel group led by <strong>Foday Sankoh</strong>.</p>
        <p>In 2002, the civil war came to an end, and the country began to rebuild. In 2007, <strong>Ernest Bai Koroma</strong> was elected president, and he served two terms in office. In 2018, <strong>Julius Maada Bio</strong> was elected president, and he has continued to work towards rebuilding and developing the country. Today, Sierra Leone is a <strong>presidential republic</strong>, with a <strong>unicameral legislature</strong> and a <strong>judiciary</strong> that is independent of the executive and legislative branches.</p>
        <p>The country's <strong>economic history</strong> has been marked by significant challenges, including a decline in the mining industry and a dependence on foreign aid. However, in recent years, the country has made efforts to diversify its economy and attract foreign investment. The government has also implemented policies aimed at reducing poverty and improving living standards for its citizens.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>

The country has a rich cultural heritage, with influences from <strong>African</strong>, <strong>European</strong>, and <strong>Islamic</strong> traditions. [/CALLOUT]</p>
