Most people in Sierra Leone rely on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around, as they are affordable and widely available. However, the condition of the roads and the vehicles themselves can be poor, making for a bumpy and sometimes uncomfortable ride. In addition, traffic congestion is a significant problem in Freetown, the capital city, which can make journeys take longer than expected.\n\nThe government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure in Sierra Leone, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of more efficient public transportation systems. However, there is still much work to be done to bring the country's transportation network up to international standards. Despite the challenges, many visitors to Sierra Leone find that the local transportation options are a great way to experience the culture and meet the friendly and welcoming people.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $10 | Limited coverage, often overcrowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Sierra Leone |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | Widely available, but often in poor condition |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Sierra Leone |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3 | $1 | $5-$10 | Not always available, may not use meter |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Orange Ride, Picap available in Freetown |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Some toll roads, but not widespread |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited schedules, often delayed |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes, often expensive |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Sierra Leone |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be prepared for **traffic congestion** and long journey times, especially in Freetown.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a taxi or shared taxi.\n- Use **reputable ride-hailing apps** like Orange Ride or Picap for a safer and more convenient experience.\n- Consider **hiring a private car and driver** for longer journeys or for a more comfortable ride.\n- Be aware of **road conditions** and take necessary precautions, such as wearing a seatbelt and avoiding travel at night.\n- Learn some **basic phrases** in the local language, such as \"how much\" and \"where is...\", to help you navigate the transportation system.",
