[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in Sierra Leone is the Lungi International Airport, located in the northern part of the country, near the city of Freetown. The airport receives flights from major airlines such as Brussels Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, and Turkish Airlines, with direct connections to European and African cities like Brussels, Casablanca, and Istanbul. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from neighboring countries Guinea and Liberia.

For those traveling from nearby countries, overland entry points can be a convenient option. The border crossings are generally well-marked, but it is essential to ensure that you have all the necessary documents, including a valid passport and visa, before attempting to cross the border. Additionally, it is recommended to research the current security situation and any travel restrictions before embarking on your journey.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in Sierra Leone are limited, with only a few airlines operating within the country. The main domestic airline is **Sierra National Airlines**, which offers flights between Freetown and other major cities like Bo, Kenema, and Makeni. Booking domestic flights can be done through the airline's website or at the airport, and prices are generally around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket. It is recommended to book in advance to ensure availability, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Sierra Leone has no rail network, making it necessary to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around the country.

However, the lack of a rail network also means that there are more opportunities to see the country's scenic landscapes and experience its vibrant culture.
