The costs of utilities can be unstable and fluctuating, with prices increasing due to inflation and seasonal variation. For example, during the dry season, water scarcity can lead to higher water costs, while during the rainy season, electricity costs may increase due to higher demand for power.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Sierra Leone can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better access to utilities such as electricity, water, and internet. However, in rural areas, these services may be limited or non-existent. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but progress has been slow. As a result, many residents rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators and solar panels, which can be expensive to maintain.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | Prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | Metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | Limited availability |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | Included in rent or separate fee |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Africell, Sierratel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 60 Mbps | Africell, Sierratel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Africell, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | Africell, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Africell, Sierratel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | Available in some areas |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | Available in some areas |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Limited availability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents typically need to contact the provider and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help residents manage their energy usage and costs.\n- Africell and Sierratel are two of the main internet providers in Sierra Leone, offering a range of plans and services.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can consider using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and using alternative sources of energy such as solar panels.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with landlords or providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term rentals or contracts.",
