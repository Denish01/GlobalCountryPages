The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, while private healthcare providers offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The system can be challenging to navigate, especially for foreigners, and having some form of insurance or financial plan in place is highly recommended.\n\nThe healthcare system in Sierra Leone is also heavily reliant on **donor funding** and international aid, which can be unpredictable and subject to change. As a result, the quality of care and availability of services can vary greatly depending on the location and provider. In general, the major cities such as Freetown tend to have better-equipped and staffed healthcare facilities, while rural areas often struggle with limited resources and personnel.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private clinics may require upfront payment |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Limited dental services available in public sector |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$30 | Private optometrists offer more comprehensive services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Public labs may have limited testing capabilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$50 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Prices vary depending on complexity and provider |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$200 | Private clinics often require upfront payment |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Limited availability in public sector |\n| X-Ray | $10-$30 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Outpatient services, basic hospitalization |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Inpatient and outpatient services, specialist care |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Comprehensive coverage, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** are widely available in pharmacies and markets, with prices ranging from $5-$20.\n- **Prescription medications** may require a doctor's note or prescription, and prices can vary depending on the type and brand.\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in major cities, but limited in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but quality and authenticity can vary.\n- Some pharmacies may offer **generic alternatives** to brand-name medications at a lower cost.\n- It is recommended to purchase medications from licensed pharmacies to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek help immediately. The emergency number in Sierra Leone is 999, but response times may be slow, and ambulance availability is limited. It is recommended to have a **personal emergency plan** in place, including contact information for local hospitals and emergency services. For foreigners, it is often best to seek care at private hospitals, which tend to have better-equipped emergency departments and more experienced staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Sierra Leone include the **Connaught Hospital** in Freetown and the **Choithram Memorial Hospital**.\n\nIn the event of a serious medical emergency, **evacuation** to a nearby country or Europe may be necessary. It is essential to have a comprehensive health insurance plan that includes evacuation and repatriation coverage. Additionally, it is recommended to research local emergency services and healthcare providers before traveling to Sierra Leone, and to have a **contingency plan** in place in case of an emergency. This can include having a list of emergency contact numbers, knowing the location of nearby hospitals, and having a plan for evacuation or repatriation if necessary.",
