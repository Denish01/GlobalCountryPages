[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Sierra Leone has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, while private healthcare providers offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The system can be challenging to navigate, especially for foreigners, and having some form of insurance or financial plan in place is highly recommended.

The healthcare system in Sierra Leone is also heavily reliant on **donor funding** and international aid, which can be unpredictable and subject to change. As a result, the quality of care and availability of services can vary greatly depending on the location and provider. In general, the major cities such as Freetown tend to have better-equipped and staffed healthcare facilities, while rural areas often struggle with limited resources and personnel.
