[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Sierra Leone is still developing, with many areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The costs of utilities can be unstable and fluctuating, with prices increasing due to inflation and seasonal variation. For example, during the dry season, water scarcity can lead to higher water costs, while during the rainy season, electricity costs may increase due to higher demand for power.

The quality of utility services in Sierra Leone can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better access to utilities such as electricity, water, and internet. However, in rural areas, these services may be limited or non-existent. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but progress has been slow. As a result, many residents rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators and solar panels, which can be expensive to maintain.
