Sierra Leone has a **territorial taxation** system, where tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the taxpayer's residence.

The tax system in Sierra Leone is administered by the National Revenue Authority (NRA), which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs duties, and other levies. The NRA also provides guidance and support to taxpayers, including expatriates and foreign workers. Taxpayers can access various services, including tax returns, payment of taxes, and tax clearance certificates, through the NRA's website or at its offices in Freetown.
