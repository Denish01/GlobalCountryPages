        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Sierra Leone's economy is classified as a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of $471. The country has a long history of economic instability, with the civil war that ended in 2002 having a devastating impact on the economy. However, since then, the country has made significant progress in rebuilding and developing its economy. The economy is driven primarily by the mining and agricultural sectors, with services also playing a significant role. Despite the progress made, the country still faces significant development challenges, including high levels of poverty and unemployment.</p>
        <p>The country's economic development has been hindered by a lack of infrastructure, including roads, energy, and telecommunications. However, the government has made significant investments in recent years to improve the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the energy sector. The country has also made significant progress in improving its business environment, including the introduction of new laws and regulations to support business growth.</p>
