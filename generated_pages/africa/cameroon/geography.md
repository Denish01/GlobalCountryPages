[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Cameroon is a country located in the western part of Central Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea. It is situated between the **Equator** and the **Tropic of Cancer**, and its geographical position has influenced its climate, culture, and history. Cameroon is bordered by six countries: Nigeria to the west, Chad to the north, the Central African Republic to the east, and the Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea to the south. The country's coastline along the Gulf of Guinea provides access to the Atlantic Ocean, which has played a significant role in its economy and trade.

The country's location has also made it a melting pot of different cultures, with influences from its neighboring countries and European colonizers. Cameroon's borders have been shaped by its history, with the country being a German colony from 1884 to 1911, and then being mandated to Britain and France after World War I. The country gained its independence in 1960, and since then, it has been working to maintain good relations with its neighboring countries and to develop its economy. The **Gulf of Guinea** coastline has also made Cameroon an important player in regional and international trade, with the country's ports serving as a gateway to Central Africa.
