[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Cameroonian government is characterized by a strong presidency, with the **President** serving as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a seven-year term, and has significant powers to appoint and dismiss government officials, as well as to dissolve the National Assembly. The **National Assembly** is the country's unicameral legislature, composed of 180 members elected by the people for five-year terms. The **Senate**, introduced in 2013, has 100 seats, with 70 elected by the people and 30 appointed by the President. The separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is enshrined in the constitution, but in practice, the President wields significant influence over the other branches.

The Cameroonian political system is also marked by a strong **unitary** character, with power concentrated in the central government. The country is divided into 10 regions, each headed by a **Governor** appointed by the President. While the regions have some degree of autonomy, the central government retains significant control over key areas such as security, justice, and fiscal policy. The **judicial system** is based on a mix of civil law, common law, and customary law, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest court in the land.

The government's **decision-making process** is often opaque, with key decisions made by the President and a small circle of advisors. The **National Assembly** has limited powers to check the executive, and is often criticized for being too subservient to the President. Despite these limitations, the Cameroonian political system has been relatively stable since the country's independence in 1960, with **President Paul Biya** ruling the country since 1982.
