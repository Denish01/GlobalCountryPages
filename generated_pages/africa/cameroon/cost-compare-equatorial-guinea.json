Cameroon has a more diverse economy, with a strong agricultural sector, while Equatorial Guinea is heavily reliant on its oil and gas reserves. As a result, Equatorial Guinea has a higher GDP per capita, but also a higher cost of living. The main difference in costs between the two countries lies in the prices of accommodation, food, and transportation. Cameroon offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for rent, meals, and transportation, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Cameroon has a larger population and a more developed economy, which has led to a more competitive market and lower prices. In contrast, Equatorial Guinea's economy is smaller and more dependent on oil exports, which has resulted in higher prices for goods and services.
