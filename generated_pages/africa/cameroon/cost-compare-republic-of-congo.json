Cameroon has a more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector, while the Republic of Congo is heavily reliant on oil exports. In terms of cost of living, Cameroon is generally cheaper, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.

Cameroon's economy has been growing steadily, with a GDP growth rate of around 4%, while the Republic of Congo's economy has been more volatile, with a growth rate of around 2%.
