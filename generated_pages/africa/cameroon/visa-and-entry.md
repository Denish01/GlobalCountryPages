# Cameroon Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Cameroon before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Cameroon has a moderate visa policy, requiring visitors from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. However, citizens of certain countries, such as those in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), are exempt from visa requirements. Approximately 20 countries have visa-free access to Cameroon, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an eVisa system. The country's visa policy aims to balance the need to attract tourists and business travelers with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.

The visa policy of Cameroon is subject to change, and new regulations may be introduced at short notice. It is essential for travelers to check the latest requirements before planning their trip. The country's immigration authorities are also working to improve the efficiency and transparency of the visa application process, including the introduction of online application systems and expanded eligibility for visa on arrival.
