Peak season: December and January. Budget season: March to May and September to November. Avoid: June to August and March to May for the southern regions due to heavy rainfall, and September to November for the northern regions due to the hot and dry Harmattan wind. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nCameroon has a diverse climate, ranging from **tropical** in the south to **sahelian** in the north. The country experiences two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which lasts from November to May, is characterized by cool and dry weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 25°C. The wet season, which lasts from June to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's national parks and wildlife reserves, and the wet season being ideal for surfing and other water sports.\n\nThe northern regions of Cameroon experience a hot and dry climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The **Harmattan** wind, which blows from the Sahara Desert, can make the weather very hot and dry from September to November. In contrast, the southern regions experience a tropical climate, with high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The coastal regions experience a **maritime** climate, with mild temperatures and high humidity levels.\n\nThe climate and seasons in Cameroon also affect the country's agriculture and economy. The wet season is the best time for farming, with many crops such as **cocoa**, **coffee**, and **bananas** being harvested during this period. The dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for livestock farming, with many cattle and sheep being raised during this period.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and dry | Low | $ | Hiking, wildlife viewing |\n| February | Cool and dry | Low | $ | Hiking, wildlife viewing |\n| March | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | Surfing, water sports |\n| April | Hot and wet | Med | $$ | Surfing, water sports |\n| May | Hot and wet | Med | $$ | Surfing, water sports |\n| June | Hot and wet | High | $$$ | Surfing, water sports |\n| July | Hot and wet | High | $$$ | Surfing, water sports |\n| August | Hot and wet | High | $$$ | Surfing, water sports |\n| September | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | Hiking, wildlife viewing |\n| October | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | Hiking, wildlife viewing |\n| November | Cool and dry | Low | $ | Hiking, wildlife viewing |\n| December | Cool and dry | High | $$$ | Hiking, wildlife viewing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cameroon National Festival | December | A celebration of Cameroonian culture, music, and dance |\n| Yaounde International Film Festival | September | A showcase of African and international films |\n| Douala International Arts Festival | November | A celebration of African art, music, and culture |\n| Mount Cameroon Race of Hope | February | A marathon race to the summit of Mount Cameroon |\n| Cameroon Music Festival | June | A celebration of Cameroonian music and culture |\n| Ngondo Festival | November | A celebration of the traditional culture of the Sawa people |\n| Feast of the Ascension | May | A Christian holiday celebrated with processions and festivities |\n| Eid al-Fitr | June | A Muslim holiday celebrated with feasts and festivities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The northern regions of Cameroon experience a hot and dry climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year, making the dry season the best time to visit.\n- The southern regions experience a tropical climate, with high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year, making the wet season the best time to visit.\n- The coastal regions experience a maritime climate, with mild temperatures and high humidity levels, making the dry season the best time to visit.\n- The mountainous regions experience a cool and temperate climate, with low temperatures and low humidity levels, making the dry season the best time to visit.\n- The **Sahel** region experiences a hot and dry climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year, making the dry season the best time to visit.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from March to May or September to November, to avoid the crowds and high prices.\n- Pack light and breathable clothing, as well as sunscreen and insect repellent, to protect yourself from the sun and insects.\n- Bring a waterproof jacket or umbrella, as well as warm clothing, to protect yourself from the rain and cold.\n- Avoid traveling during the Harmattan wind, from September to November, as it can make the weather very hot and dry.\n- Consider hiring a guide or joining a tour group, especially if you are not familiar with the local culture and customs.",
