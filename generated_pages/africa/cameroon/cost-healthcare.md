[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Cameroon has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and facilities, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better facilities and services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and expatriates tend to opt for private healthcare due to the higher quality of care. Insurance is not mandatory in Cameroon, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can be high and unpredictable.

The healthcare system in Cameroon is also heavily reliant on out-of-pocket payments, with 67.7% of healthcare expenditure being paid directly by individuals. This can be a significant burden for many Cameroonians, especially those living in rural areas or with limited financial resources. For foreigners, having health insurance that covers them in Cameroon can be a lifesaver, as medical costs can be high and payment is often required upfront. It is also important to note that some private hospitals and clinics may not accept certain types of insurance, so it is essential to check beforehand.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek help immediately. The emergency number in Cameroon is 112 or 15, and ambulance services are available in major cities. However, ambulance services may not always be available or reliable, especially in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including the embassy and insurance provider. The best hospitals for foreigners in Cameroon are generally private hospitals, such as the **Yaounde General Hospital** and the **Douala General Hospital**, which offer better facilities and services. However, even in these hospitals, medical care may not always meet Western standards, and evacuation to a neighboring country or Europe may be necessary in serious cases.
