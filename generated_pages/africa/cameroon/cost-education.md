[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Cameroon is divided into public and private institutions, with public schools generally offering a lower quality of education due to limited resources and infrastructure. The language of instruction in Cameroon is either French or English, depending on the region, and students are required to attend school for a minimum of 10 years, from the age of 6 to 16. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, with better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.

The quality of education in Cameroon is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, with a significant gap between public and private institutions. However, there are some excellent private schools and international schools that offer a high-quality education, often with a focus on bilingualism and international curricula. These schools are popular with expats and wealthy Cameroonians, but are often unaffordable for the majority of the population. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including teacher training programs and infrastructure development, but more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the education sector.
