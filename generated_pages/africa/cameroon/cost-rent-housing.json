Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a **deposit** equivalent to 1-2 months' rent required. Cameroon's housing costs are relatively **high** compared to its regional neighbors, such as Nigeria and the Central African Republic, but lower than those in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. The country's **inflation rate** of 4.5% and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 67.7% can also impact the affordability of housing.\n\nThe housing market in Cameroon is characterized by a **shortage of affordable housing**, particularly in urban areas such as Yaounde and Douala. This has led to a **rental market** dominated by short-term leases and high rents. However, the government has implemented initiatives to **increase access to affordable housing**, including the development of new housing projects and the provision of subsidies for low-income households. Despite these efforts, the **affordability** of housing remains a significant challenge for many Cameroonians, with a significant proportion of the population **spending more than 30% of their income on housing**.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $150-$300 | Furnished, private bathroom and kitchen |\n| 2 Bedroom | $350-$600 | $250-$450 | Family size, amenities like AC and washing machine |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$900 | $350-$600 | Spacious, luxury amenities like pool and gym |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | Residential areas, basic amenities |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | Limited amenities, rural areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Bastos**: A popular neighborhood in Yaounde, with rents ranging from $200-$500 USD per month, known for its **expat community** and **modern amenities**.\n- **Mokolo**: A vibrant neighborhood in Yaounde, with rents ranging from $150-$300 USD per month, known for its **nightlife** and **restaurant scene**.\n- **Douala Bonapriso**: A upscale neighborhood in Douala, with rents ranging from $300-$600 USD per month, known for its **luxury amenities** and **expat community**.\n- **Yaounde Plateau**: A central neighborhood in Yaounde, with rents ranging from $250-$450 USD per month, known for its **convenience** and **access to amenities**.\n- **Kribi**: A coastal town, with rents ranging from $100-$250 USD per month, known for its **beaches** and **relaxed atmosphere**.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Cameroon [/SECTION]\n- Research **local neighborhoods** and **rental prices** before starting your housing search.\n- **Negotiate** the rent and **lease terms** with the landlord, as this is a common practice in Cameroon.\n- Be aware of **scams** and **fake listings**, and always **inspect the property** before signing a lease.\n- **Utilities** such as electricity and water are usually **not included** in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget.\n- **Furnished** apartments are more common in Cameroon, but **unfurnished** options are also available, so clarify this with the landlord before signing a lease.\n- Consider **working with a real estate agent** to help you find a suitable property and navigate the rental process.",
