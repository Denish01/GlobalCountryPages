[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Cameroon's economy is a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The country is classified as a Lower-Middle Income economy, with a GDP per capita of $1,350. The economy has been growing steadily over the past decade, driven by a combination of factors including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including poverty, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure. Cameroon's economic development is also influenced by its strategic location in Central Africa, with access to the Gulf of Guinea and proximity to major markets in the region.

The country's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, which accounts for approximately 20% of GDP and employs around 60% of the labor force. The main crops include coffee, cocoa, cotton, and maize. The mining sector is also significant, with Cameroon being a major producer of oil, gas, and minerals such as aluminum and iron. The manufacturing sector is smaller, but has been growing in recent years, with a focus on textiles, food processing, and construction materials.

Cameroon's economic trajectory is expected to continue growing, driven by investments in infrastructure, agriculture, and mining. However, the country needs to address its development challenges, including corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of economic diversification. The government has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including the creation of special economic zones and the promotion of foreign investment.
