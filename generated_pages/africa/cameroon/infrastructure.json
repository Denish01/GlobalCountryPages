  "content": "Cameroon's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant investments being made to improve the country's transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 55% of population\nInternet Penetration: 25%\nRoad Network: 20,000 km, moderate quality with some paved highways\nRail Network: 1,008 km\nMajor Airports: 5\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nCameroon's infrastructure development level is moderate, with the country having made significant progress in recent years to improve its transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure such as electricity, clean water, and paved roads. The government has been investing heavily in infrastructure development, with a focus on improving the business environment and promoting economic growth. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, corruption, and bureaucratic inefficiencies.\n\nThe government's infrastructure development strategy is focused on improving the country's competitiveness and promoting economic growth. This includes investing in the development of new transportation infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and ports, as well as improving the country's energy and telecommunications networks. The government is also working to improve the business environment, by streamlining regulatory procedures and reducing bureaucratic barriers to investment.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing Cameroon's infrastructure development is the lack of funding. The government has been working to attract private sector investment, through public-private partnerships and other initiatives. However, the country's infrastructure sector is still heavily reliant on government funding, which can be unpredictable and subject to budget constraints. Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to improving the country's infrastructure, and is working to develop a more sustainable and inclusive development model.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 20,000 km | Moderate | Some paved highways, but many rural roads are unpaved and in poor condition |\n| Railways | 1,008 km | Poor | Rail network is limited and in need of upgrade |\n| Airports | 5 international, 10 domestic | Good | Major airports are well-equipped, but some domestic airports are in need of upgrade |\n| Ports | 1 major | Good | The port of Douala is a major hub for international trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of power generation in Cameroon is **hydroelectric power**, which accounts for around 70% of the country's electricity production.\n- The country's power grid is still relatively underdeveloped, with many rural areas lacking access to electricity.\n- **Thermal power** plants are also used to generate electricity, particularly in urban areas.\n- The government is working to improve the reliability of the power supply, by investing in new generation and transmission infrastructure.\n- There are plans to develop **renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is not always safe to drink, particularly in rural areas where the water supply is often contaminated.\n- **Sanitation** coverage is still relatively low, with many people lacking access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- The government is working to improve access to clean water and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Water access** is a major challenge in rural areas, where many people rely on traditional sources such as wells and springs.\n- The government is working to develop new water infrastructure, including pipes and treatment plants, to improve access to clean water.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with most of the country having access to mobile phone networks.\n- **Fiber optic** cables are being laid to improve internet connectivity, particularly in urban areas.\n- The government is working to improve **broadband** access, particularly in rural areas where internet connectivity is still limited.\n- **4G** networks are being rolled out, to improve mobile internet connectivity.\n- The **postal service** is still relatively underdeveloped, with many people relying on private courier services to send and receive mail.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government is working on a major **transportation infrastructure** development project, which includes the construction of new roads, railways, and ports.\n- The **Lom Pangar dam** project is a major hydroelectric power project, which will increase the country's electricity generation capacity.\n- The government is working to develop a new **national fiber optic network**, to improve internet connectivity and promote economic development.\n- The **Cameroon-Chad pipeline** project is a major oil pipeline project, which will transport oil from Chad to the port of Douala.\n- The government is working to develop a new **water infrastructure** development project, which includes the construction of new pipes and treatment plants to improve access to clean water.",
