# Cameroon Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Cameroon's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant investments being made to improve the country's transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 55% of population
Internet Penetration: 25%
Road Network: 20,000 km, moderate quality with some paved highways
Rail Network: 1,008 km
Major Airports: 5
Major Ports: 1
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Cameroon's infrastructure development level is moderate, with the country having made significant progress in recent years to improve its transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure such as electricity, clean water, and paved roads. The government has been investing heavily in infrastructure development, with a focus on improving the business environment and promoting economic growth. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, corruption, and bureaucratic inefficiencies.

The government's infrastructure development strategy is focused on improving the country's competitiveness and promoting economic growth. This includes investing in the development of new transportation infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and ports, as well as improving the country's energy and telecommunications networks. The government is also working to improve the business environment, by streamlining regulatory procedures and reducing bureaucratic barriers to investment.

One of the major challenges facing Cameroon's infrastructure development is the lack of funding. The government has been working to attract private sector investment, through public-private partnerships and other initiatives. However, the country's infrastructure sector is still heavily reliant on government funding, which can be unpredictable and subject to budget constraints. Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to improving the country's infrastructure, and is working to develop a more sustainable and inclusive development model.
