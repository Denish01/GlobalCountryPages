[SECTION] How Cameroon Is Divided [/SECTION]
Cameroon is divided into 10 regions, each with its own unique character and administrative structure. The regions are further divided into 58 departments, which are then divided into communes. The 10 regions of Cameroon are: Adamawa, Centre, East, Far North, Littoral, North, North-West, South, South-West, and West. This administrative structure allows for a balance of power and representation across the country, with each region having its own governor and regional assembly.

The division of Cameroon into regions is based on a combination of geographical, cultural, and historical factors. The country's diverse landscape, which ranges from tropical rainforests to arid deserts, has played a significant role in shaping the regional identities and economies. Additionally, the country's complex history, which has been influenced by various colonial powers and ethnic groups, has contributed to the development of distinct cultural and linguistic traditions in each region.
