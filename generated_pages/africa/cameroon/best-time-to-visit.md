[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Cameroon has a diverse climate, ranging from **tropical** in the south to **sahelian** in the north. The country experiences two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which lasts from November to May, is characterized by cool and dry weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 25°C. The wet season, which lasts from June to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's national parks and wildlife reserves, and the wet season being ideal for surfing and other water sports.

The northern regions of Cameroon experience a hot and dry climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The **Harmattan** wind, which blows from the Sahara Desert, can make the weather very hot and dry from September to November. In contrast, the southern regions experience a tropical climate, with high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The coastal regions experience a **maritime** climate, with mild temperatures and high humidity levels.

The climate and seasons in Cameroon also affect the country's agriculture and economy. The wet season is the best time for farming, with many crops such as **cocoa**, **coffee**, and **bananas** being harvested during this period. The dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for livestock farming, with many cattle and sheep being raised during this period.
