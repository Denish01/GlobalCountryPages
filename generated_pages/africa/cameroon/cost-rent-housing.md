[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Cameroon is relatively **unregulated**, with most leases being short-term and tenant rights limited. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a **deposit** equivalent to 1-2 months' rent required. Cameroon's housing costs are relatively **high** compared to its regional neighbors, such as Nigeria and the Central African Republic, but lower than those in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. The country's **inflation rate** of 4.5% and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 67.7% can also impact the affordability of housing.

The housing market in Cameroon is characterized by a **shortage of affordable housing**, particularly in urban areas such as Yaounde and Douala. This has led to a **rental market** dominated by short-term leases and high rents. However, the government has implemented initiatives to **increase access to affordable housing**, including the development of new housing projects and the provision of subsidies for low-income households. Despite these efforts, the **affordability** of housing remains a significant challenge for many Cameroonians, with a significant proportion of the population **spending more than 30% of their income on housing**.
