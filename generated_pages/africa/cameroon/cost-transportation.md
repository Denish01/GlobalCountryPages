[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Cameroon has a diverse range of transportation modes, including buses, taxis, minivans, and motorcycles. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with larger cities like Yaounde and Douala having more developed systems. Most people in Cameroon get around using **informal transportation** methods, such as shared taxis and minivans, which are often cheaper but less reliable than formal public transportation. The country's transportation network is also affected by its **geography**, with mountainous regions making it difficult to build and maintain roads.

In general, the transportation system in Cameroon is **underdeveloped**, with a lack of investment in infrastructure and maintenance. This can lead to **congestion** and **delays**, especially in urban areas. However, the government has been working to improve the transportation network, with plans to build new roads and expand public transportation systems.
