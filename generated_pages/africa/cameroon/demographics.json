  "content": "The demographics of Cameroon are characterized by a diverse population of approximately 28.6 million people, with a mix of over 200 ethnic groups, two official languages, and a range of religions.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 28.6 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.6%\nMedian Age: 18.5 years\nUrban Population: 56.3%\nPopulation Density: 60 people per km2\nLife Expectancy: 59 years\nFertility Rate: 4.6 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nCameroon's population is relatively large compared to its neighboring countries, and it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 2.6%, which is higher than the global average. The country's urban population accounts for about 56.3% of the total population, with the majority residing in major cities such as Yaounde and Douala. The urbanization trend is driven by economic opportunities, improved access to education and healthcare, and the desire for a better quality of life. However, this rapid urbanization also poses significant challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, housing shortages, and increased poverty.\n\nThe population of Cameroon is also characterized by a high fertility rate, with an average of 4.6 children per woman. This has contributed to the country's rapid population growth and has significant implications for the provision of education, healthcare, and other social services. The government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at reducing the fertility rate and promoting family planning, but more needs to be done to address this issue. In terms of migration patterns, Cameroon has a significant diaspora community, with many citizens living and working abroad, particularly in Europe and North America.\n\nThe country's population is also affected by internal migration, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of economic opportunities. This has led to the development of slums and informal settlements in major cities, which often lack basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. The government has implemented various initiatives aimed at addressing these challenges, including the development of new urban planning policies and the provision of basic services to informal settlements.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bamum | 7.2% | Western Region | Known for their rich cultural heritage and traditional crafts |\n| Bamileke | 24.3% | Western Region | One of the largest ethnic groups in Cameroon, known for their agricultural skills |\n| Beti | 25.7% | Central Region | Predominantly found in the central region, known for their farming and trading activities |\n| Fulani | 10.4% | Northern Region | A nomadic people, known for their cattle herding and Islamic faith |\n| Hausa | 4.8% | Northern Region | Found in the northern region, known for their trading and commercial activities |\n| Mafa | 3.6% | Far North Region | Known for their traditional farming practices and rich cultural heritage |\n| Tikar | 2.5% | Western Region | Known for their skilled craftsmanship and traditional dances |\n\nThe ethnic diversity of Cameroon is a significant aspect of the country's cultural heritage.
