The cost of living in Cameroon is influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a moderate inflation rate of 4.5% and a significant portion of out-of-pocket health spend. The overall affordability of Cameroon makes it an attractive destination for expats, digital nomads, and tourists. However, the cost of living can vary significantly depending on the lifestyle and location, with cities like Yaounde and Douala tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe different budget tiers in Cameroon can significantly impact the quality of life, with budget living requiring a more frugal approach, mid-range living offering a moderate level of comfort, and comfortable living providing a high level of luxury. For example, a budget of $400-700 per month would require cooking most meals, using public transportation, and living in a shared apartment, while a mid-range budget of $800-1,200 per month would allow for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center, eating out occasionally, and using a mix of public and private transportation.
