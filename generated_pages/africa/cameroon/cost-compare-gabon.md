[SECTION] Overview: Cameroon vs Gabon [/SECTION]
Cameroon and Gabon are two neighboring countries in Central Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost structures. Cameroon has a more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector, while Gabon's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports.
