  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Cameroon can vary significantly depending on the type of care and location, with public healthcare options generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and availability, while private options are more expensive but offer better facilities and services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $79\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 67.7%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112 or 15 for emergency services\nInsurance Required: No\nCurrency: XAF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nCameroon has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and facilities, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better facilities and services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and expatriates tend to opt for private healthcare due to the higher quality of care. Insurance is not mandatory in Cameroon, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can be high and unpredictable.\n\nThe healthcare system in Cameroon is also heavily reliant on out-of-pocket payments, with 67.7% of healthcare expenditure being paid directly by individuals. This can be a significant burden for many Cameroonians, especially those living in rural areas or with limited financial resources. For foreigners, having health insurance that covers them in Cameroon can be a lifesaver, as medical costs can be high and payment is often required upfront. It is also important to note that some private hospitals and clinics may not accept certain types of insurance, so it is essential to check beforehand.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by dentist's qualifications and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by optometrist's qualifications and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by lab and test type |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Prices vary by type of surgery and surgeon's experience |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Covers medical services worldwide, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies, but may require a doctor's prescription\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and markets\n- Prices for medications vary by type and brand, but are generally lower than in Western countries\n- Some common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, can cost between $5-$20 per pack\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration dates and packaging of medications before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek help immediately. The emergency number in Cameroon is 112 or 15, and ambulance services are available in major cities. However, ambulance services may not always be available or reliable, especially in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including the embassy and insurance provider. The best hospitals for foreigners in Cameroon are generally private hospitals, such as the **Yaounde General Hospital** and the **Douala General Hospital**, which offer better facilities and services. However, even in these hospitals, medical care may not always meet Western standards, and evacuation to a neighboring country or Europe may be necessary in serious cases.",
