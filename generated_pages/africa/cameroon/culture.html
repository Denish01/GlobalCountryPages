        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Cameroon's culture is a rich and diverse blend of over 200 ethnic groups, with a mix of African, French, and British influences. The country's strategic location in Central Africa, bordering six countries, has contributed to its unique cultural identity. The main ethnic groups include the Bamum, Bamileke, and Douala, each with their own distinct customs and traditions. The official languages, French and English, reflect the country's history as a former German colony that was later mandated to France and the United Kingdom after World War I.</p>
        <p>The cultural landscape of Cameroon is also shaped by its geography, with the country spanning from the Atlantic coast to the Sahara Desert. The diverse regions, including the coastal, mountainous, and savannah areas, have given rise to a wide range of cultural practices and traditions. For example, the <strong>Baka</strong> people, who live in the southeastern region, are known for their skilled hunting and gathering practices, while the <strong>Fulani</strong> people, who are found in the northern regions, are renowned for their expertise in cattle herding. This cultural diversity has contributed to Cameroon's reputation as "Africa in miniature," with a microcosm of the continent's cultural, linguistic, and geographical diversity.</p>
        <p>Cameroon's cultural identity is also influenced by its history of colonization and the subsequent blending of traditional and modern practices. The country's urban centers, such as Yaounde and Douala, showcase a mix of traditional and modern architecture, with colonial-era buildings standing alongside modern skyscrapers. The cultural scene is also vibrant, with a thriving arts and music scene that reflects the country's diverse heritage. From traditional <strong>makossa</strong> music to modern <strong>coupe-decalé</strong> dance styles, Cameroon's cultural expression is a unique blend of traditional and contemporary influences.</p>
