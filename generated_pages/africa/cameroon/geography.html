        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Cameroon is a country located in the western part of Central Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea. It is situated between the <strong>Equator</strong> and the <strong>Tropic of Cancer</strong>, and its geographical position has influenced its climate, culture, and history. Cameroon is bordered by six countries: Nigeria to the west, Chad to the north, the Central African Republic to the east, and the Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea to the south. The country's coastline along the Gulf of Guinea provides access to the Atlantic Ocean, which has played a significant role in its economy and trade.</p>
        <p>The country's location has also made it a melting pot of different cultures, with influences from its neighboring countries and European colonizers. Cameroon's borders have been shaped by its history, with the country being a German colony from 1884 to 1911, and then being mandated to Britain and France after World War I. The country gained its independence in 1960, and since then, it has been working to maintain good relations with its neighboring countries and to develop its economy. The <strong>Gulf of Guinea</strong> coastline has also made Cameroon an important player in regional and international trade, with the country's ports serving as a gateway to Central Africa.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Cameroon's terrain is diverse, with a range of landscapes that include mountains, forests, savannas, and coastlines. The country can be divided into five main geographical regions: the coastal plain, the <strong>Mount Cameroon</strong> range, the <strong>Adamawa Plateau</strong>, the <strong>Sudan savanna</strong>, and the <strong>Congolian basin</strong>. The coastal plain is a narrow strip of land along the Gulf of Guinea, with a range of beaches, mangrove forests, and salt marshes. The Mount Cameroon range is a chain of volcanic mountains that stretches along the coast, with the highest peak being Mount Cameroon, which is also an active volcano.</p>
        <p>The Adamawa Plateau is a region of highlands that covers much of northern Cameroon, with a range of mountains, valleys, and rivers. The Sudan savanna is a region of grasslands and open woodlands that covers the northern part of the country, with a range of wild animals, including elephants, lions, and giraffes. The Congolian basin is a region of tropical rainforests that covers the southern part of the country, with a range of rivers, including the <strong>Sangha River</strong> and the <strong>Nyong River</strong>. The country's diverse terrain and landscape have made it a popular destination for tourists, with a range of outdoor activities, including hiking, camping, and wildlife watching.</p>
        <p>The country's terrain has also played a significant role in shaping its economy and culture. The <strong>agricultural sector</strong> is a major contributor to the country's economy, with the country producing a range of crops, including coffee, cocoa, and cotton. The country's forests are also an important source of timber, with the <strong>logging industry</strong> being a significant contributor to the country's economy. The country's rivers have also been harnessed for hydroelectric power, with the <strong>Sanaga River</strong> being a major source of electricity for the country.</p>
