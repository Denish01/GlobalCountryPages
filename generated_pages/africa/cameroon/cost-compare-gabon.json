Cameroon has a more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector, while Gabon's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports. This difference in economic structure is reflected in the cost of living, with Cameroon generally being more affordable than Gabon. The cost of living in Cameroon is lower due to factors such as lower housing costs, food prices, and transportation expenses.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Cameroon has a larger population and a more developed manufacturing sector, which contributes to its lower costs. In contrast, Gabon has a smaller population and a more limited manufacturing sector, resulting in higher costs for many goods and services. Overall, Cameroon is a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, while Gabon may be more suitable for those with higher incomes or a stronger desire for modern amenities and infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cameroon (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 400 | 50% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 300 | 50% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 800 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cameroon (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 4 | 50% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cameroon (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cameroon (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Cameroon (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 800 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 2,000 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Cameroon is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices 50% lower than in Gabon\n- Food and dining, with meal prices 50% lower and grocery costs 33% lower\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices 50% and 33% lower, respectively\n- Utilities and internet, with costs 37% and 40% lower, respectively\n\n- **Gabon is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and luxury goods, with a wider range of international brands available\n- Modern amenities and infrastructure, with better roads, hospitals, and schools\n- Tourism and travel, with more developed tourist infrastructure and a wider range of activities\n- Business and investment, with a more stable and secure business environment\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Cameroon offers a more affordable cost of living, with lower housing costs, food prices, and transportation expenses.
