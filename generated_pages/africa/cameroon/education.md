[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Cameroon is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 11, is designed to provide a solid foundation in basic subjects such as mathematics, science, and languages. Secondary education, which lasts for 7 years, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle, which lasts for 4 years, and the second cycle, which lasts for 3 years. The quality of education in Cameroon is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on public education. However, there are significant disparities between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better-equipped schools and more qualified teachers. Public schools are generally free, but private schools, which offer alternative curricula and teaching methods, are available for those who can afford them.

The Cameroonian government has made significant efforts to improve the quality of education in recent years, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods. However, the system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, Cameroon has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with enrollment rates increasing significantly in recent years.

The tertiary education system in Cameroon is composed of universities and other higher education institutions, which offer a range of academic and professional programs. The University of Yaounde, which is the largest university in Cameroon, offers a range of programs in fields such as law, medicine, and engineering. Other universities, such as the University of Douala and the University of Buea, also offer a range of programs in fields such as business, economics, and social sciences.
