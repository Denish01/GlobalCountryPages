[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Cameroon's utility infrastructure is still developing, with frequent power outages and water shortages, especially during the dry season. The costs of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher electricity and water costs during the dry season. The country's economy has been growing steadily, with a GDP per capita PPP of $5,589, but the inflation rate of 4.5% can affect the prices of utilities and other essential services.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Cameroon varies depending on the region, with urban areas like Yaounde and Douala having more reliable access to electricity and water. However, the out-of-pocket health spend of 67.7% and the education spend of 2.8% of GDP indicate that the country still faces significant development challenges. As a result, utility costs can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited financial resources.
