[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Cameroon's healthcare system is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by health centers and dispensaries, while secondary care is offered by district hospitals. Tertiary care, which includes specialized services, is available in regional and national hospitals. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, but private providers are also present, particularly in urban areas. The quality of care varies significantly between public and private facilities, with private hospitals generally offering better equipment and more qualified staff. Urban areas, such as Yaounde and Douala, have greater access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where facilities are often understaffed and under-equipped.

The public healthcare system in Cameroon is **universal**, but it is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to a shortage of medical supplies and equipment. As a result, many Cameroonians rely on private healthcare providers, which can be expensive and out of reach for low-income individuals. In recent years, the government has implemented initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of **health insurance** schemes and the construction of new healthcare facilities.

Despite these efforts, Cameroon still faces significant challenges in its healthcare sector, including a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services in rural areas. The country also struggles with a high burden of **infectious diseases**, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis, which are major public health concerns.
