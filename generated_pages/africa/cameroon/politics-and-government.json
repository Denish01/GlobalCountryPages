  "content": "Cameroon is governed as a **unitary presidential republic**, with a system that combines elements of French and British colonial legacies, as well as traditional African institutions.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President (Paul Biya)\nHead of Government: Prime Minister (Joseph Dion Ngute)\nLegislature: National Assembly, bicameral (180 seats in the National Assembly, 100 seats in the Senate)\nLegal System: Mixed (civil law, common law, and customary law)\nPolitical Stability Index: Cameroon ranks 124 out of 163 countries in the Global Peace Index, indicating a medium level of stability\nCorruption Index: Ranked 153 out of 180 countries in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating a high level of corruption\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe Cameroonian government is characterized by a strong presidency, with the **President** serving as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a seven-year term, and has significant powers to appoint and dismiss government officials, as well as to dissolve the National Assembly. The **National Assembly** is the country's unicameral legislature, composed of 180 members elected by the people for five-year terms. The **Senate**, introduced in 2013, has 100 seats, with 70 elected by the people and 30 appointed by the President. The separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is enshrined in the constitution, but in practice, the President wields significant influence over the other branches.\n\nThe Cameroonian political system is also marked by a strong **unitary** character, with power concentrated in the central government. The country is divided into 10 regions, each headed by a **Governor** appointed by the President. While the regions have some degree of autonomy, the central government retains significant control over key areas such as security, justice, and fiscal policy. The **judicial system** is based on a mix of civil law, common law, and customary law, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest court in the land.\n\nThe government's **decision-making process** is often opaque, with key decisions made by the President and a small circle of advisors. The **National Assembly** has limited powers to check the executive, and is often criticized for being too subservient to the President. Despite these limitations, the Cameroonian political system has been relatively stable since the country's independence in 1960, with **President Paul Biya** ruling the country since 1982.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Paul Biya | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute | Head of government |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker Cavaye Yeguié Djibril | Lawmaking body |\n| Legislative | Senate | President Marcel Niat Njifenji | Upper house of parliament |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Highest court in the land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) | Center-right | President Paul Biya | 139 | Ruling party since 1985 |\n| Social Democratic Front (SDF) | Center-left | John Fru Ndi | 18 | Main opposition party |\n| National Union for Democracy and Progress (NUDP) | Center-right | Bello Bouba Maigari | 7 | Opposition party |\n| Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) | Left-wing | Sanogo Lamine | 3 | Opposition party |\n| Cameroon Democratic Union (CDU) | Center-right | Adamou Ndam Njoya | 2 | Opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Cameroon is based on a **majoritarian system**, with the President and National Assembly members elected by direct universal suffrage.\n- Elections are held every **five years** for the National Assembly and every **seven years** for the President.\n- The last presidential election was held in **2018**, with President Paul Biya winning a seventh term in office.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled for **2025**, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Cameroon faces significant **security challenges**, including the **Boko Haram insurgency** in the north and **separatist movements** in the Anglophone regions.\n- The country has a **low ranking** in the Global Peace Index, due to factors such as corruption, human rights abuses, and political instability.\n- The government has been criticized for its **human rights record**, including restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly.\n- The **Anglophone crisis** has resulted in significant violence and displacement, with the government struggling to find a lasting solution.\n- The country faces **economic challenges**, including a large trade deficit and a significant dependence on oil exports.\n- Cameroon has a **low ranking** in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating a high level of corruption.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Cameroon is a member of the **United Nations** and the **African Union**, and has played a key role in regional organizations such as the **Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)**.\n- The country has **strong relations** with **France**, its former colonial power, and has also developed close ties with **China** and other emerging economies.\n- Cameroon has **border disputes** with several of its neighbors, including Nigeria and the Central African Republic.\n- The country has **participated in regional peacekeeping missions**, including the **United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA)**.\n- Cameroon has **diversified its economy** in recent years, with a growing focus on **agriculture** and **mining**.",
