  "content": "The average cost of utilities and internet in Cameroon can range from $50 to $150 per month for a small to medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and provider.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($100-$120 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30-$50 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10-$20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: XAF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nCameroon's utility infrastructure is still developing, with frequent power outages and water shortages, especially during the dry season. The costs of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher electricity and water costs during the dry season. The country's economy has been growing steadily, with a GDP per capita PPP of $5,589, but the inflation rate of 4.5% can affect the prices of utilities and other essential services.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Cameroon varies depending on the region, with urban areas like Yaounde and Douala having more reliable access to electricity and water. However, the out-of-pocket health spend of 67.7% and the education spend of 2.8% of GDP indicate that the country still faces significant development challenges. As a result, utility costs can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited financial resources.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30-$50 | $50-$70 | $80-$100 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | $30-$40 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | $30-$40 | bottled gas or charcoal |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5-$10 | $10-$15 | $15-$20 | included in rent or separate |\n| **Total** | **$55-$100** | **$100-$145** | **$155-$200** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-$30 | 10 Mbps | Camtel, MTN |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-$70 | 60 Mbps | Camtel, MTN, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-$10 | 1 GB | MTN, Orange, Nexttel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$30 | 5 GB | MTN, Orange, Nexttel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-$100 | varies | Camtel, MTN, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8-$10 | available in English and French |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10-$15 | available in English and French |\n| Local Streaming | $5-$10 | limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's best to contact the provider directly or work with a local real estate agent to facilitate the process.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget their energy usage.\n- Camtel and MTN are two of the most reliable internet providers in Cameroon, offering a range of plans to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with your landlord or property manager to see if they can include utilities in the rent or provide a discount for long-term leases.",
