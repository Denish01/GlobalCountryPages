        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Cameroon, a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in Central Africa, has a rich and diverse history. The area that is now Cameroon was first inhabited by various indigenous groups, including the <strong>Bantu</strong> and <strong>Sudanic</strong> peoples. In the 15th century, Portuguese explorers arrived in the region, followed by German colonizers in the late 19th century. Cameroon was officially declared a German colony in 1884, and it remained under German rule until the end of World War I. Following the war, the country was mandated to Britain and France by the League of Nations, with Britain administering the northern part of the country and France administering the southern part. Cameroon gained its independence from France on January 1, 1960, and from Britain on October 1, 1961. The country became a federal republic, with <strong>Ahmadou Ahidjo</strong> as its first president.</p>
        <p>The country's early years of independence were marked by a series of challenges, including the need to integrate the English-speaking and French-speaking regions. In 1972, Cameroon became a unitary state, with a single government and a single official language, <strong>French</strong>. However, in 1996, the country adopted a new constitution, which recognized <strong>English</strong> as an official language alongside French. Today, Cameroon is a <strong>bilingual</strong> country, with both French and English being widely spoken.</p>
        <p>Cameroon's history has also been shaped by its geography. The country is located in the <strong>tropical</strong> region of Central Africa, with a diverse range of landscapes, including <strong>mountains</strong>, <strong>forests</strong>, and <strong>coastal</strong> areas. The country's geography has played a significant role in shaping its culture, economy, and politics. The <strong>Cameroon Highlands</strong>, for example, are home to a number of indigenous groups, while the <strong>coastal</strong> regions are more densely populated and have a more diverse economy.</p>
        <p>In terms of <strong>classification</strong>, Cameroon is a <strong>lower-middle-income</strong> country, according to the World Bank. The country has a diverse economy, with a mix of <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>mining</strong>, and <strong>manufacturing</strong>. The country is also a member of the <strong>Commonwealth</strong> and the <strong>Francophonie</strong>, reflecting its historical ties to Britain and France.</p>
