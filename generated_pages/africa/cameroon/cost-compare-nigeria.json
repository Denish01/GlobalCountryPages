The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Cameroon has a relatively stable economy, with a growing service sector and a strong agricultural industry.

Additionally, Cameroon has a more developed tourism infrastructure, which can make it easier for foreigners to navigate and find affordable options. Nigeria, on the other hand, has a larger and more diverse economy, with a wider range of job opportunities and a more vibrant cultural scene.
