The economy has been growing steadily over the past decade, driven by a combination of factors including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.

The main crops include coffee, cocoa, cotton, and maize. The mining sector is also significant, with Cameroon being a major producer of oil, gas, and minerals such as aluminum and iron.
