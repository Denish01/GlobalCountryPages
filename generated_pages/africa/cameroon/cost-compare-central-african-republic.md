[SECTION] Overview: Cameroon vs Central African Republic [/SECTION]
Cameroon and Central African Republic are two neighboring countries in Central Africa with distinct economic profiles. Cameroon has a relatively more diversified economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, while Central African Republic's economy is largely dependent on agriculture and forestry. As a result, Cameroon tends to have a more stable and growing economy, which is reflected in its lower cost of living. The overall cost of living in Cameroon is around 15-20% lower than in Central African Republic, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Cameroon has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, transportation, and communication networks, which makes it easier for people to access goods and services. In contrast, Central African Republic's infrastructure is still developing, which can drive up costs for transportation, housing, and other essential services. Additionally, Cameroon's larger economy and more diverse industry base tend to create more job opportunities and a more competitive market, which can help keep prices lower.
