# The Truth About Cameroon - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Cameroon, a **sovereign** country located in Central Africa, has a rich and diverse history. The area that is now Cameroon was first inhabited by various indigenous groups, including the **Bantu** and **Sudanic** peoples. In the 15th century, Portuguese explorers arrived in the region, followed by German colonizers in the late 19th century. Cameroon was officially declared a German colony in 1884, and it remained under German rule until the end of World War I. Following the war, the country was mandated to Britain and France by the League of Nations, with Britain administering the northern part of the country and France administering the southern part. Cameroon gained its independence from France on January 1, 1960, and from Britain on October 1, 1961. The country became a federal republic, with **Ahmadou Ahidjo** as its first president.

The country's early years of independence were marked by a series of challenges, including the need to integrate the English-speaking and French-speaking regions.

However, in 1996, the country adopted a new constitution, which recognized **English** as an official language alongside French. Today, Cameroon is a **bilingual** country, with both French and English being widely spoken.
