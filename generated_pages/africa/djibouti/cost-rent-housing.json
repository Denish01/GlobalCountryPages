The rental market is primarily driven by expatriates and foreign workers, which has led to an increase in prices over the years. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and it is essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Djibouti's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center.\n\nThe housing market in Djibouti is also influenced by the country's strategic location and its role as a major port and trade hub. The city's infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with modern amenities and services available. However, the cost of living in Djibouti can be high, particularly for expatriates and foreigners. The government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, but the demand for housing remains high, particularly in the city center.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $400-$600 | $200-$400 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$800 | $300-$500 | Modern amenities, private facilities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $500-$800 | Family size, comfortable living space |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,200 | Spacious, luxurious amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$2,500 | Prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,500 | Residential areas, comfortable living space |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | Limited amenities, rural areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Plateau du Serpent**: A upscale neighborhood with modern amenities, $800-$1,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Quartier de l'Europe**: A historic neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, $600-$1,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Haramous**: A residential neighborhood with a range of accommodation options, $400-$800 per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Nahda**: A modern neighborhood with luxurious amenities, $1,000-$1,500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Balbala**: A suburban neighborhood with a mix of residential and commercial areas, $300-$600 per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Djibouti [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and compare prices before renting\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Carefully review the lease agreement and negotiate the terms if necessary\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and first month's rent in advance\n- Check the condition of the property and report any damages or issues to the landlord\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment to avoid the cost of purchasing furniture and appliances",
