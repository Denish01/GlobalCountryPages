[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Djibouti's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare services are generally more affordable, but they often suffer from a lack of resources, outdated equipment, and limited availability of specialized care. In contrast, private healthcare services are more expensive, but they offer better quality care, more specialized treatments, and shorter waiting times. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private services. Having health insurance is recommended, as it can help cover the cost of medical care, especially in emergency situations.

The healthcare system in Djibouti is not well-developed, and medical facilities are often limited, especially outside of the capital city. As a result, many patients are forced to seek medical care abroad, particularly in neighboring countries or in Europe. For foreigners, it is essential to have a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers medical evacuation and repatriation, as well as emergency medical care. Additionally, many private hospitals and clinics in Djibouti have partnerships with international insurance providers, making it easier for foreigners to access quality medical care.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 17 or 18, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Public hospitals, such as the Peltier Hospital, offer emergency care, but may not have advanced equipment or specialized treatments. Private hospitals, such as the **Djibouti International Hospital**, may offer better quality care and more advanced treatments, but may be more expensive. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers emergency medical evacuation and repatriation, as well as emergency medical care.

When seeking emergency care, it is crucial to have a means of payment, as many hospitals and clinics may require upfront payment or proof of insurance. Additionally, having a **medical evacuation plan** in place can be lifesaving, as it can provide rapid transportation to a medical facility in a neighboring country or Europe. It is also essential to research the best hospitals and medical facilities in Djibouti, particularly those that cater to foreigners and offer high-quality care. By being prepared and having the right insurance coverage, individuals can ensure they receive the best possible medical care in the event of an emergency.
