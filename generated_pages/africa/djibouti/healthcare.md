[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Djibouti is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, which includes hospitals, health centers, and dispensaries. However, the quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with **Djibouti City** having better-equipped and staffed facilities. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a shortage of medical supplies and equipment. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better-quality care but are often expensive and out of reach for the average citizen.

The healthcare system in Djibouti faces several challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of access to healthcare services in rural areas. The country also struggles with a high prevalence of **infectious diseases** such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding for healthcare and implementing programs to improve access to healthcare services.

In recent years, Djibouti has made progress in improving its healthcare system, including the construction of new hospitals and health centers. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas. The government has also implemented programs to improve the training and retention of healthcare professionals, which is critical to improving the quality of care.
