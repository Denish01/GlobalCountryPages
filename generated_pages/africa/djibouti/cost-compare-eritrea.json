  "content": "Djibouti is generally more expensive than Eritrea, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nDjibouti GDP per Capita (PPP): 3,464\nEritrea GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,444\nDjibouti Inflation Rate: 3.2%\nEritrea Inflation Rate: 10.4%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Eritrea\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Djibouti vs Eritrea [/SECTION]\nDjibouti and Eritrea are two neighboring countries in the Horn of Africa, with distinct economic contexts. Djibouti has a relatively stable economy, driven by its strategic location as a trade hub and its growing tourism industry. In contrast, Eritrea's economy has been heavily impacted by international sanctions and a lack of foreign investment, leading to a more challenging economic environment. As a result, Eritrea tends to be cheaper than Djibouti, with a lower cost of living that can be attractive to expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable destination.\n\nThe cost difference between Djibouti and Eritrea is significant, with Eritrea being around 20-30% cheaper overall. This is reflected in various aspects of daily life, from housing and food to transportation and utilities. However, it's essential to note that Djibouti offers a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which may justify the higher costs for some individuals. In contrast, Eritrea's lower costs come with a more limited range of services and a more challenging living environment.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Eritrea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 250 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 150 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 37.5% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Eritrea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 70 | 30% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 2 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Eritrea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 0.5 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 0.8 | 33.3% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Eritrea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 60 | 40% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Djibouti (USD) | Eritrea (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 500 | 37.5% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 800 | 33.3% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,200 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Djibouti is cheaper for:**\n- High-end dining and entertainment options\n- International flights and travel connections\n- Modern amenities and infrastructure\n- Access to quality healthcare services\n- **Eritrea is cheaper for:**\n- Basic groceries and food staples\n- Local transportation and fuel\n- Accommodation options, including apartments and houses\n- Basic utilities and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable destination, Eritrea may be the better choice, with a lower cost of living and a more laid-back atmosphere.
