The language of instruction is primarily French, with Arabic also being taught in some schools. The public education system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, with limited resources and outdated curricula. However, the government has been working to improve the public education system, with efforts to increase access to education and improve teacher training. Compulsory education in Djibouti lasts for 9 years, from ages 6 to 15, and is free for all citizens.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the public education system, there are some high-quality private schools in Djibouti, particularly in the capital city. These schools often have better resources and more qualified teachers, and may offer a range of curricula, including French, American, and British systems. International schools are also available in Djibouti, catering to the children of expatriates and diplomats. These schools typically offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated curricula |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Better resources, more qualified teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated curricula |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,000 | Better resources, more qualified teachers |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | IB, CIE, and other international curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$300 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs, outdated facilities |\n| Private University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | Better resources, more qualified faculty |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$2,500 | $3,000-$4,000 | Université de Djibouti, limited programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability, basic facilities |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Qualified tutors, flexible scheduling |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | French, Arabic, and English courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic materials, limited availability |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Required for all students, basic design |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Djibouti are typically international schools, which offer a range of curricula and better resources.\n- Scholarship availability is limited in Djibouti, but some private schools and universities offer financial aid to qualified students.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular in Djibouti, with some universities and schools offering distance learning programs.\n- Education quality in Djibouti is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, but there are efforts to improve the system.\n- Parents should research schools thoroughly and consider factors such as curriculum, resources, and teacher qualifications when choosing a school for their child.\n- [CALLOUT] It is essential to note that the education system in Djibouti is still developing, and parents should be prepared for challenges and limitations, particularly in the public sector.",
