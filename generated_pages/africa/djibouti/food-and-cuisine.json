The cuisine is known for its bold flavors, with a focus on spices, herbs, and chilies. Regional variations can be found in different parts of the country, with the coastal regions featuring more seafood-based dishes, while the interior regions focus on meat and vegetable-based dishes.\n\nThe country's cuisine is also influenced by its **nomadic** traditions, with many dishes featuring meat, especially goat and lamb, which are staples in Djiboutian cuisine. The use of **injera**, a flatbread made from sourdough, is also a common feature in many Djiboutian dishes. **Injera** is used to scoop up food and is an integral part of the country's culinary culture.\n\nDjibouti's cuisine is also known for its **hospitality**, with food playing a central role in social gatherings and celebrations. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and the sharing of food is an important part of the country's cultural heritage.
