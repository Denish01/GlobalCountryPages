Primary education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, and is provided free of charge by the government. Secondary education is also free, but not compulsory, and is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for 4 years, and the second cycle lasts for 3 years. Tertiary education is provided by universities and other institutions, and is not free. The quality of education in Djibouti varies, with public schools often struggling with limited resources and overcrowding, while private schools tend to offer better facilities and more qualified teachers.\n\nThe education system in Djibouti faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, limited resources, and a lack of access to education in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding for education and implementing new programs to improve teacher training and student outcomes. The public and private sectors both play a role in providing education in Djibouti, with public schools being the primary provider of education, and private schools catering to those who can afford to pay for a better quality education.\n\nOverall, the education system in Djibouti has made significant progress in recent years, but still faces many challenges. The government's efforts to improve the education system have shown promise, and the country is working to increase access to quality education for all citizens. With continued investment and support, the education system in Djibouti has the potential to become a model for other countries in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
