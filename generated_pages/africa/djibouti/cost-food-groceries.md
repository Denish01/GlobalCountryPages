[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Djibouti are generally higher compared to the regional average, mainly due to the country's reliance on imports and its strategic location along the Red Sea. The **inflation rate** of 2.1% in 2024 also contributes to the increasing cost of living. Djibouti's unique cultural blend of French, Arabic, and African influences is reflected in its cuisine, with a mix of traditional dishes and international flavors. Eating out is a common practice, especially in the capital city, where restaurants and cafes serve a variety of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also prevalent, with many locals opting to prepare traditional dishes such as **skoudehkaris** (a meat stew) and **fahsa** (a flatbread) at home.

The cost of food in Djibouti can be driven up by factors such as transportation costs, taxes, and the limited availability of certain ingredients. On the other hand, prices can be driven down by the availability of local produce, such as fruits and vegetables, and the presence of traditional markets where prices are often lower. The **GDP per capita PPP** of $7,810 in 2024 indicates a relatively high standard of living, which contributes to the demand for a wide range of food products. Overall, the food culture in Djibouti is a unique blend of traditional and international influences, with a mix of eating out and home cooking.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Djibouti can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to have a wider selection of products, including imported goods, but prices are often higher. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of **tomatoes** can cost $1.50 at a supermarket, while at a local market, it can cost $1.00. When shopping at local markets, it's common to **bargain**, especially for fresh produce.
