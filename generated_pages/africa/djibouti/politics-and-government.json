  "content": "Djibouti is governed as a **unitary presidential republic**, with a president serving as both the head of state and head of government, and a multi-party system with a dominant party.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh\nHead of Government: President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh\nLegislature: National Assembly, unicameral, 65 seats\nLegal System: Mixed law, based on French civil law and Islamic law\nPolitical Stability Index: 54th out of 178 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: 128th out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nDjibouti's government is characterized by a strong presidency, with the president holding significant executive powers. The president is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to a maximum of two terms. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, with each branch having distinct roles and responsibilities. The executive branch is headed by the president, who appoints the prime minister and other ministers. The legislative branch is composed of the National Assembly, a unicameral body with 65 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The judicial branch is independent and comprises the Supreme Court and lower courts.\n\nThe **unitary system** of government in Djibouti means that the central government has significant powers and authority, with limited autonomy granted to regional and local authorities. This has contributed to a relatively stable political environment, with the government able to implement policies and projects effectively. However, it has also been criticized for limiting opportunities for **decentralization** and **participation** at the local level.\n\nThe **political system** in Djibouti has undergone significant changes since independence in 1977. The country has transitioned from a single-party system to a multi-party system, with several parties participating in elections. However, the ruling **Union for the Presidential Majority** (UMP) has dominated politics, with the president and his allies holding significant influence over the government and the economy.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed | Head of government administration |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker Mohamed Ali Houmed | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Interpretation of laws and judicial review |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Union for the Presidential Majority (UMP) | Center-right | President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh | 43 | Dominant party, supports the president |\n| Union for National Democracy (UDN) | Center-left | Aden Robleh Awaleh | 3 | Opposition party, advocates for democratic reforms |\n| National Democratic Party (PND) | Center | Abdirahman Djama | 1 | Opposition party, focuses on economic development |\n| Front for Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) | Left-wing | Ali Mohamed Daoud | 10 | Opposition party, advocates for social justice and human rights |\n| Republican Alliance for Development (ARD) | Center-right | Ali Mohamed Daoud | 4 | Opposition party, supports economic liberalization |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Djibouti is based on **proportional representation**, with voters electing members to the National Assembly for a five-year term.\n- Presidential elections are held every five years, with the president limited to a maximum of two terms.\n- The last presidential election was held in 2021, with President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh winning a fifth term.\n- The next parliamentary election is scheduled for 2026, with the National Assembly expected to be dissolved in 2025.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current **political climate** in Djibouti is relatively stable, with the government maintaining control and the opposition parties participating in the political process.\n- Key issues facing the government include **poverty reduction**, **infrastructure development**, and **regional security**.\n- Regional dynamics, particularly the conflict in neighboring Somalia and Eritrea, pose a significant challenge to Djibouti's stability and security.\n- The country has made progress in improving its **human rights** record, but concerns remain about **freedom of expression** and **assembly**.\n- Djibouti ranks 128th out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating a need for improved **transparency** and **accountability** in government.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Djibouti is a member of the **United Nations**, the **African Union**, and the **Arab League**, and participates in regional organizations such as the **Intergovernmental Authority on Development** (IGAD).\n- The country has close **diplomatic relations** with France, the United States, and other Western countries, and receives significant **development assistance** from these partners.\n- Djibouti has also strengthened its relations with **China**, which has invested heavily in the country's infrastructure and economy.\n- The country has a **strategic location** on the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, making it an important hub for international trade and shipping.\n- Djibouti has hosted several international **peacekeeping missions**, including the United Nations Mission in Somalia (UNISOM) and the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).",
