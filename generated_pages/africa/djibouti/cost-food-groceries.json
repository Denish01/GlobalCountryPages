  "content": "The cost of food in Djibouti can vary greatly, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant starting from $3 USD and a monthly grocery budget for one person ranging from $150-$300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($3 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($20-$30 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($150-$300 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($2-$3 USD)\nCurrency: DJF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nFood prices in Djibouti are generally higher compared to the regional average, mainly due to the country's reliance on imports and its strategic location along the Red Sea. The **inflation rate** of 2.1% in 2024 also contributes to the increasing cost of living. Djibouti's unique cultural blend of French, Arabic, and African influences is reflected in its cuisine, with a mix of traditional dishes and international flavors. Eating out is a common practice, especially in the capital city, where restaurants and cafes serve a variety of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also prevalent, with many locals opting to prepare traditional dishes such as **skoudehkaris** (a meat stew) and **fahsa** (a flatbread) at home.\n\nThe cost of food in Djibouti can be driven up by factors such as transportation costs, taxes, and the limited availability of certain ingredients. On the other hand, prices can be driven down by the availability of local produce, such as fruits and vegetables, and the presence of traditional markets where prices are often lower. The **GDP per capita PPP** of $7,810 in 2024 indicates a relatively high standard of living, which contributes to the demand for a wide range of food products. Overall, the food culture in Djibouti is a unique blend of traditional and international influences, with a mix of eating out and home cooking.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 75 DJF | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 60 DJF | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 100 DJF | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.80 | 90 DJF | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 300 DJF | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 500 DJF | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 150 DJF | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 75 DJF | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.20 | 60 DJF | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00 | 50 DJF | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 400 DJF | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 50 DJF | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like **injera** and **fahsa**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Djibouti can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to have a wider selection of products, including imported goods, but prices are often higher. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of **tomatoes** can cost $1.50 at a supermarket, while at a local market, it can cost $1.00. When shopping at local markets, it's common to **bargain**, especially for fresh produce. You can often get a better price by buying in bulk or by shopping during the early morning or late evening when prices tend to be lower.\n\nWhen deciding where to shop, it's worth considering what you need to buy. For staples like **rice**, **pasta**, and **canned goods**, supermarkets may be the better option. However, for fresh produce, meat, and traditional products, local markets are often the way to go. Additionally, local markets offer a unique shopping experience, with the opportunity to interact with vendors and learn about the local culture. By shopping at local markets, you can also support the local economy and help to preserve traditional practices.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries and street food stalls is a great way to try traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- **Injera**, a sourdough flatbread, is a staple in Djiboutian cuisine and can be bought for around $1 per piece.\n- Fresh produce, such as **fruits** and **vegetables**, is widely available and often cheaper at local markets.\n- **Skoudehkaris**, a traditional meat stew, is a hearty and flavorful dish that can be found at many local restaurants.\n- Avoid buying imported products, such as **apples**, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- When shopping at local markets, be prepared to **bargain** and don't be afraid to walk away if the price is not right.",
