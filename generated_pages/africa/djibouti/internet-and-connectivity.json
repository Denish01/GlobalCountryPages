  "content": "The internet in Djibouti is relatively slow and limited, with an average speed of 5 Mbps, but it is possible to get a SIM card and access mobile data and WiFi in the capital city and other urban areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Djibouti Telecom, Evatis, Somcable\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Djibouti is still in the development stage, with an average speed of 5 Mbps, which can be frustrating for users who are accustomed to faster speeds. The urban-rural divide is significant, with internet access being more readily available in the capital city of Djibouti and other urban areas, while rural areas often have limited or no access to the internet. The reliability of the internet can also be a problem, with frequent outages and slow speeds, especially during peak hours.\n\nDespite these challenges, the government of Djibouti has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with the goal of increasing access to the internet and improving speeds. This has included the installation of new fiber optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks to more rural areas. However, more work needs to be done to bring the country's internet up to par with other countries in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Djibouti is relatively straightforward, with several mobile carriers offering prepaid SIM cards that can be purchased at airports, shops, and markets. To purchase a SIM card, you will need to provide your passport and proof of address, such as a hotel reservation or a letter from your employer. The cost of a SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans are available from several carriers, including Djibouti Telecom, Evatis, and Somcable.\n\nDjibouti Telecom is the largest carrier in the country and offers a range of data plans, including a tourist plan that includes 1 GB of data and costs approximately 20 USD per month. Evatis and Somcable also offer similar plans, with prices starting at around 15 USD per month. It is recommended that you purchase a SIM card from one of these carriers, as they have the best coverage and most reliable networks.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Djibouti Telecom | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 20 | Includes 10 minutes of international calls |\n| Evatis | Prepaid Plan | 500 MB | 10 | Includes 5 minutes of international calls |\n| Somcable | Data Plan | 2 GB | 30 | Includes 20 minutes of international calls |\n| Orange Djibouti | Internet Plan | 1 GB | 25 | Includes 15 minutes of international calls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi is generally available in most hotels, especially in the capital city, but the quality can be slow and unreliable.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not well established in Djibouti, but some cafes and restaurants in the capital city do offer WiFi to their customers.\n- Coworking spaces are limited in Djibouti, but there are a few options available in the capital city, including the Djibouti Coworking Space and the Hub Djibouti.\n- Public WiFi is not widely available in Djibouti, but some government buildings and public institutions do offer free WiFi to visitors.\n- Some restaurants and bars also offer WiFi to their customers, especially in the capital city.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces such as the Djibouti Coworking Space and the Hub Djibouti offer a reliable and fast internet connection, as well as other amenities such as meeting rooms and printers.\n- Cafe chains such as Cafe de la Gare and Cafe de la Place offer a relatively fast and reliable internet connection, as well as a comfortable working environment.\n- Backup internet options such as mobile hotspots and satellite internet are available, but can be expensive and may not be reliable.\n- VPNs are recommended for remote workers, as they can help to protect against cyber threats and ensure a secure internet connection.\n- Some hotels and resorts also offer a reliable and fast internet connection, as well as other amenities such as meeting rooms and printers.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a problem in Djibouti, with some websites and social media platforms being blocked by the government.\n- Blocked sites include some news websites and social media platforms, as well as some online services such as VPNs and proxy servers.\n- VPNs are recommended for users who want to access blocked websites and ensure a secure internet connection.\n- Roaming alternatives such as international SIM cards and portable WiFi hotspots are available, but can be expensive and may not be reliable.\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Djibouti, but some carriers do offer eSIM plans for certain devices.\n- It is recommended that users take precautions to protect themselves against cyber threats, such as using strong passwords and keeping their devices and software up to date.",
