[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Djibouti's transportation network is relatively underdeveloped, with limited options for getting around the country. The most common modes of transportation are **taxis**, **minibuses**, and **city buses**, which operate in the capital city and other major towns. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of reliability being common issues. Most people in Djibouti rely on **private vehicles** or **taxis** to get around, while others use **minibuses** and **city buses** for shorter trips.

The road network in Djibouti is limited, with many roads being unpaved and in poor condition. However, the government has been investing in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads and the improvement of existing ones. Despite these efforts, transportation costs in Djibouti can be relatively high, especially for **fuel** and **vehicle maintenance**. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system makes it difficult for people to get around without relying on **private vehicles** or **taxis**.
