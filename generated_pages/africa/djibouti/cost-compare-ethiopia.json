  "content": "Djibouti is generally more expensive than Ethiopia, with an average cost of living that is around 20-30% higher.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nDjibouti GDP per Capita (PPP): 3,564\nEthiopia GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,244\nDjibouti Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nEthiopia Inflation Rate: 20.6%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Ethiopia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Djibouti vs Ethiopia [/SECTION]\nDjibouti and Ethiopia are two neighboring countries in the Horn of Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost structures. Djibouti has a relatively high-income economy, driven by its strategic location and port activities, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Ethiopia has a lower-income economy, with a larger population and a more diverse range of industries, resulting in lower prices for many goods and services. On average, Ethiopia is around 20-30% cheaper than Djibouti, making it a more attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost structures. Djibouti has a relatively small and open economy, with a high dependence on imports, which can drive up prices for certain goods. Ethiopia, on the other hand, has a larger and more diversified economy, with a growing manufacturing sector and a significant agricultural sector, which helps to keep prices lower. Overall, while Djibouti offers a more modern and developed infrastructure, Ethiopia provides a more affordable and authentic African experience.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Ethiopia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 400 | 100% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 250 | 100% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 900 | 66% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Ethiopia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 5 | 200% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 70 | 43% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 2 | 150% more |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1 | 100% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Ethiopia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 100% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 0.5 | 100% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 0.8 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Ethiopia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 50% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 67% more |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 10 | 100% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Djibouti (USD) | Ethiopia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 800 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,000 | 1,400 | 29% |\n| Comfortable | 3,500 | 2,500 | 29% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Djibouti is cheaper for:**\n- High-end dining and entertainment options\n- Modern and well-equipped gyms and fitness centers\n- International schools and educational institutions\n- **Ethiopia is cheaper for:**\n- Local transportation and taxi fares\n- Traditional clothing and handicrafts\n- Fresh produce and local food markets\n- Accommodation options outside of city centers\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats and travelers looking for a more modern and developed infrastructure, Djibouti may be the better choice, despite its higher cost of living. However, for those on a tighter budget or looking for a more authentic African experience, Ethiopia is likely to be the more attractive option. Students and young travelers may find Ethiopia's lower prices and vibrant cultural scene to be particularly appealing, while families may appreciate the more affordable accommodation options and outdoor activities. Retirees, on the other hand, may prefer Djibouti's more developed healthcare system and modern amenities. Ultimately, the choice between Djibouti and Ethiopia depends on individual priorities and lifestyles.\n\nIn terms of overall value, Ethiopia is likely to offer a better balance of affordability and quality of life, particularly for those who are willing to venture outside of the major cities and explore the country's diverse cultural and natural attractions. However, Djibouti's unique blend of French and African influences, combined with its stunning natural beauty and modern amenities, make it a compelling choice for those who are willing to pay a premium for a more exclusive and luxurious experience.",
