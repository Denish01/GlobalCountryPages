[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Djibouti is a small country located in the **Horn of Africa**, bordered by the Red Sea to the east, Eritrea to the north, Ethiopia to the west and south, and Somalia to the southeast.

This strait is a vital shipping route, with many international vessels passing through it every year.

Djibouti's borders are marked by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries. The border with Eritrea is defined by a series of hills and mountains, while the border with Ethiopia is marked by a long, arid plain.
