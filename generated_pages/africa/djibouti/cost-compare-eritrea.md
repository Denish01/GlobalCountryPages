[SECTION] Overview: Djibouti vs Eritrea [/SECTION]
Djibouti and Eritrea are two neighboring countries in the Horn of Africa, with distinct economic contexts. Djibouti has a relatively stable economy, driven by its strategic location as a trade hub and its growing tourism industry. In contrast, Eritrea's economy has been heavily impacted by international sanctions and a lack of foreign investment, leading to a more challenging economic environment. As a result, Eritrea tends to be cheaper than Djibouti, with a lower cost of living that can be attractive to expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable destination.

The cost difference between Djibouti and Eritrea is significant, with Eritrea being around 20-30% cheaper overall. This is reflected in various aspects of daily life, from housing and food to transportation and utilities. However, it's essential to note that Djibouti offers a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which may justify the higher costs for some individuals. In contrast, Eritrea's lower costs come with a more limited range of services and a more challenging living environment.
