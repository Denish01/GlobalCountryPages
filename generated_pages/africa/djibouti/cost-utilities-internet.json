The costs of utilities in Djibouti can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the summer months due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the costs remain relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe utility costs in Djibouti are also affected by the country's reliance on imported fuel and the high cost of transportation. The electricity cost, for example, is around $0.20 per kWh, which is higher than the regional average. The water cost is also relatively high, with an average cost of $1.50 per cubic meter. The gas and heating costs are relatively low, as most households use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking and heating.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | LPG |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$155** | **$225** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Djibouti Telecom, Evatis |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 100 Mbps | Djibouti Telecom, Evatis |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Djibouti Telecom, Somtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Djibouti Telecom, Somtel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Djibouti Telecom, Evatis |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Djibouti, it is recommended to contact the service providers directly, such as Djibouti Telecom for electricity and internet, and the local municipality for water and garbage collection.\n- Prepaid electricity is a popular option in Djibouti, as it allows households to control their energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Djibouti are Djibouti Telecom and Evatis, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, reducing water usage, and using public transportation instead of private vehicles.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with service providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
