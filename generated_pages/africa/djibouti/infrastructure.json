  "content": "Djibouti's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant investments being made in recent years to improve the country's transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 70% of population\nInternet Penetration: 55%\nRoad Network: 3,065 km, moderate quality with some paved roads and many unpaved ones\nRail Network: 97 km, limited to a single line connecting Djibouti to Ethiopia\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 2, with the Port of Djibouti being a major hub for international trade\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nDjibouti's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has been actively investing in various projects to improve the situation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's transportation networks, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the port of Djibouti. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic infrastructure services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The capital city of Djibouti has relatively well-developed infrastructure, while rural areas often lack basic services.\n\nThe government has also been working to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, particularly in the energy and telecommunications sectors. This has led to the establishment of several new companies providing services such as mobile phone networks and internet access. Despite these efforts, much work remains to be done to address the country's infrastructure challenges, particularly in rural areas where many communities lack access to basic services.\n\nDjibouti's strategic location at the southern entrance of the Red Sea, near the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, makes it an important hub for international trade and commerce. The country's infrastructure development is closely tied to its economic growth, and the government has been actively seeking to attract foreign investment to support the development of new infrastructure projects.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 3,065 km | Moderate | Many roads are unpaved and in poor condition, particularly in rural areas |\n| Railways | 97 km | Limited | The rail network is limited to a single line connecting Djibouti to Ethiopia |\n| Airports | 3 international, 2 domestic | Good | The country has a well-developed airport network, with the main airport located in the capital city |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | The Port of Djibouti is a major hub for international trade, with a significant amount of cargo passing through it each year |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of power generation in Djibouti is **thermal energy**, with most electricity being produced from diesel and heavy fuel oil.\n- The country's power grid is relatively unreliable, with frequent **power outages** occurring due to a lack of generating capacity and outdated infrastructure.\n- Djibouti has made significant progress in recent years in developing its **renewable energy** sector, with several new solar and wind power projects being established.\n- The government has set a target of generating 30% of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2025.\n- **Energy efficiency** is a major challenge in Djibouti, with many buildings and homes lacking basic insulation and energy-efficient appliances.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is not always safe to drink in Djibouti, particularly in rural areas where water treatment facilities are often lacking.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively low, with many households lacking access to basic sanitation facilities such as toilets and showers.\n- **Water access** is a significant challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional wells and water sources that are often contaminated.\n- The government has been working to improve access to **clean water** and sanitation, with several new projects being established to upgrade water treatment facilities and expand sanitation coverage.\n- **Wastewater management** is a major challenge in Djibouti, with many cities and towns lacking adequate wastewater treatment facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively good in Djibouti, with several mobile phone networks operating in the country.\n- **Fiber-optic internet** is available in some areas, particularly in the capital city, but **broadband penetration** is relatively low.\n- The government has been working to improve **internet access** and **4G/5G rollout**, with several new projects being established to upgrade the country's telecommunications infrastructure.\n- **Postal services** are relatively underdeveloped in Djibouti, with many areas lacking access to basic postal services.\n- The country has made significant progress in recent years in developing its **information and communication technology (ICT)** sector, with several new companies and startups being established.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major **infrastructure development project** to upgrade the country's transportation networks, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the port of Djibouti.\n- A new **renewable energy project** is being established to generate 30% of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2025.\n- The **Djibouti Water and Sanitation Project** aims to improve access to clean water and sanitation in rural areas, with several new water treatment facilities and sanitation systems being established.\n- The **Djibouti Telecommunications Project** aims to improve internet access and mobile coverage, with several new fiber-optic internet and mobile phone networks being established.\n- The government has also launched a major **urban development project** to upgrade the country's urban infrastructure, including the construction of new housing, roads, and public buildings.",
