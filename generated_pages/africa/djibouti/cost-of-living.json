[/SECTION]\nDjibouti is considered one of the more expensive countries in Africa, with a high cost of living due to its strategic location and limited natural resources. The country's economy is heavily reliant on imports, which contributes to the high prices of goods and services. Compared to its neighbors, Djibouti is more expensive than Ethiopia and Somalia, but similar in price to Eritrea. The high cost of living in Djibouti is also driven by the presence of international military bases and the country's role as a major shipping hub.\n\nThe cost of living in Djibouti can be challenging for visitors and expatriates, especially when it comes to accommodation and food.
