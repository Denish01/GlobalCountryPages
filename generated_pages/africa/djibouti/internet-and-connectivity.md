[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Djibouti is still in the development stage, with an average speed of 5 Mbps, which can be frustrating for users who are accustomed to faster speeds. The urban-rural divide is significant, with internet access being more readily available in the capital city of Djibouti and other urban areas, while rural areas often have limited or no access to the internet. The reliability of the internet can also be a problem, with frequent outages and slow speeds, especially during peak hours.

Despite these challenges, the government of Djibouti has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with the goal of increasing access to the internet and improving speeds. This has included the installation of new fiber optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks to more rural areas. However, more work needs to be done to bring the country's internet up to par with other countries in the region.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Djibouti is relatively straightforward, with several mobile carriers offering prepaid SIM cards that can be purchased at airports, shops, and markets. To purchase a SIM card, you will need to provide your passport and proof of address, such as a hotel reservation or a letter from your employer. The cost of a SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans are available from several carriers, including Djibouti Telecom, Evatis, and Somcable.

Djibouti Telecom is the largest carrier in the country and offers a range of data plans, including a tourist plan that includes 1 GB of data and costs approximately 20 USD per month. Evatis and Somcable also offer similar plans, with prices starting at around 15 USD per month. It is recommended that you purchase a SIM card from one of these carriers, as they have the best coverage and most reliable networks.
