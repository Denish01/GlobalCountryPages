[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Djibouti is relatively small and largely driven by government and foreign investment. The country's strategic location at the southern entrance of the Red Sea, near the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, makes it an important hub for trade and transportation. As a result, the demand for commercial and residential properties, particularly in the capital city of Djibouti, is increasing. The current market conditions are characterized by a shortage of high-quality properties, which has led to a steady increase in prices over the past few years. The price trajectory is expected to continue on an upward trend, driven by the growing economy and infrastructure development.

The urban areas, such as Djibouti City and Ali Sabieh, offer more amenities and services, making them more attractive to investors and residents. In contrast, the rural areas are largely underdeveloped, with limited access to basic services like electricity, water, and healthcare. However, the government has launched initiatives to promote rural development and improve living standards in these areas. The property market in Djibouti is also influenced by the presence of foreign military bases, which has created a demand for rental properties, particularly in the capital city.

The government has implemented policies to encourage foreign investment, including the creation of free zones and special economic areas. These initiatives have attracted investors from countries like China, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates, who are interested in developing infrastructure projects, such as ports, roads, and energy facilities. As a result, the property market in Djibouti is expected to continue growing, driven by the increasing demand for commercial and residential properties.
