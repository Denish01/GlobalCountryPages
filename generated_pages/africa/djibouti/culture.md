# Djibouti Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Djibouti's culture is a unique blend of African, Arab, and French influences, reflecting its strategic location at the southern entrance of the Red Sea. The country has a diverse ethnic makeup, with the Somali and Afar being the two main ethnic groups, each with their own distinct language and customs. The official languages, French and Arabic, also play a significant role in shaping the country's cultural identity. The majority of the population practices Islam, which has a profound impact on the daily life and traditions of the people. The cultural identity of Djibouti is also influenced by its history as a French colony, which has left a lasting legacy in the country's architecture, cuisine, and education system.

The Somali and Afar ethnic groups have a rich cultural heritage, with their own traditional music, dance, and art forms. The Somali people are known for their poetry and storytelling, while the Afar are famous for their traditional dances and handicrafts.
