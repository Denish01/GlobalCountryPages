  "content": "The cost of transportation in Djibouti can vary greatly, with a monthly transit pass costing around $25 USD and taxi start rates at approximately $2 USD, while fuel costs around $1.20 USD per liter.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($25 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($2 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.20 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (Yes — Little Cab, Talixo)\nCurrency: DJF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nDjibouti's transportation network is relatively underdeveloped, with limited options for getting around the country. The most common modes of transportation are **taxis**, **minibuses**, and **city buses**, which operate in the capital city and other major towns. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of reliability being common issues. Most people in Djibouti rely on **private vehicles** or **taxis** to get around, while others use **minibuses** and **city buses** for shorter trips.\n\nThe road network in Djibouti is limited, with many roads being unpaved and in poor condition. However, the government has been investing in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads and the improvement of existing ones. Despite these efforts, transportation costs in Djibouti can be relatively high, especially for **fuel** and **vehicle maintenance**. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system makes it difficult for people to get around without relying on **private vehicles** or **taxis**.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $15 | Limited coverage, overcrowding common |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | Routes limited to major towns |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Availability limited outside major towns |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Little Cab, Talixo available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, fixed rate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mostly for highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, poor road conditions |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, limited availability |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **city buses** for shorter trips.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Little Cab or Talixo for convenient and relatively affordable transportation.\n- Always **negotiate taxi fares** before starting your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- Be aware of **poor road conditions** and **limited infrastructure** when driving or taking public transportation.\n- Consider **renting a car** for longer trips or for more flexibility, but be aware of **limited availability** and **high costs**.\n- Use **official taxi services** or **reputable ride-hailing apps** to ensure **safety** and **reliability**.",
