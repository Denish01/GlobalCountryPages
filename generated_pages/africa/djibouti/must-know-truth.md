# The Truth About Djibouti - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Djibouti, a sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa, has a rich and complex history. The territory was inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the **Somali** and **Afar**, long before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1896, the area became a French colony, known as French Somaliland, and was officially declared a territory of France. The country gained independence from France on June 27, 1977, after a long struggle for self-rule. The newly independent nation was named the Republic of Djibouti, with **Hassan Gouled Aptidon** as its first president.

The early years of independence were marked by a fragile economy and a lack of infrastructure. However, the country's strategic location, with access to the **Bab-el-Mandeb** strait, made it an important hub for international trade and commerce. In the 1990s, Djibouti experienced a civil war, which lasted for several years and had a significant impact on the country's development. The conflict was eventually resolved through a peace agreement, and the country has since made progress in rebuilding its economy and infrastructure.

The country has played a key role in regional affairs, hosting international meetings and conferences, and has been a member of various regional organizations, including the **African Union** and the **Arab League**. Today, Djibouti continues to navigate the complexities of regional politics, while working to develop its economy and improve the lives of its citizens.

The official languages of Djibouti are **French** and **Arabic**, although **Somali** and **Afar** are also widely spoken.
