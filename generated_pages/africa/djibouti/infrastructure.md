# Djibouti Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Djibouti's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant investments being made in recent years to improve the country's transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 70% of population
Internet Penetration: 55%
Road Network: 3,065 km, moderate quality with some paved roads and many unpaved ones
Rail Network: 97 km, limited to a single line connecting Djibouti to Ethiopia
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 2, with the Port of Djibouti being a major hub for international trade
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Djibouti's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has been actively investing in various projects to improve the situation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's transportation networks, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the port of Djibouti. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic infrastructure services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The capital city of Djibouti has relatively well-developed infrastructure, while rural areas often lack basic services.

The government has also been working to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, particularly in the energy and telecommunications sectors. This has led to the establishment of several new companies providing services such as mobile phone networks and internet access. Despite these efforts, much work remains to be done to address the country's infrastructure challenges, particularly in rural areas where many communities lack access to basic services.

Djibouti's strategic location at the southern entrance of the Red Sea, near the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, makes it an important hub for international trade and commerce. The country's infrastructure development is closely tied to its economic growth, and the government has been actively seeking to attract foreign investment to support the development of new infrastructure projects.
