[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Djibouti's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages, especially during the dry season. The costs of utilities in Djibouti can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the summer months due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the costs remain relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

The utility costs in Djibouti are also affected by the country's reliance on imported fuel and the high cost of transportation. The electricity cost, for example, is around $0.20 per kWh, which is higher than the regional average. The water cost is also relatively high, with an average cost of $1.50 per cubic meter. The gas and heating costs are relatively low, as most households use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking and heating.
