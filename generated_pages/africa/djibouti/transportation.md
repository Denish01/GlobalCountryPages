[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Djibouti's main international airport is Ambouli International Airport, located about 6 kilometers from the capital city of Djibouti. The airport receives direct flights from major hubs such as Paris, Dubai, and Addis Ababa, making it a convenient entry point for travelers. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from neighboring countries like Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. However, overland travel can be challenging due to the rough road conditions and security concerns in some areas.

For travelers planning to visit Djibouti, it's essential to research and book flights in advance, especially during peak travel seasons. Additionally, it's recommended to check with the airline for any specific requirements, such as visa requirements or travel restrictions, before embarking on your journey. The airport offers basic amenities, including restaurants, shops, and currency exchange services, making it a relatively comfortable entry point for visitors.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Djibouti has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights between the capital city and other major towns. The main domestic airline is Djibouti Airlines, which offers flights to destinations like Ali Sabieh, Tadjourah, and Obock. Booking domestic flights can be done through the airline's website or at the airport, and approximate costs range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and time of booking. It's recommended to book in advance, as flights can be irregular and often subject to change.
