  "content": "Djibouti is generally more expensive than Somalia, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% higher.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nDjibouti GDP per Capita (PPP): 3,788\nSomalia GDP per Capita (PPP): 444\nDjibouti Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nSomalia Inflation Rate: 3.1%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Somalia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Djibouti vs Somalia [/SECTION]\nDjibouti and Somalia are two neighboring countries in the Horn of Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Djibouti has a relatively stable economy, with a strong focus on trade and commerce, while Somalia is still recovering from years of conflict and instability. As a result, Djibouti tends to have higher prices for goods and services, particularly in the capital city of Djibouti. However, Somalia's prices can be volatile due to the country's fragile security situation and limited infrastructure.\n\nThe cost of living in Djibouti is generally higher than in Somalia, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being significantly steeper. However, Djibouti's economy is more diversified, with a stronger service sector and a more developed tourism industry. This means that expats and foreigners may find more job opportunities and a higher standard of living in Djibouti, despite the higher costs. In contrast, Somalia's cost of living is generally lower, but the country's security situation and limited infrastructure can make it a more challenging place to live and work.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 250 | 60% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 150 | 67% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 60% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 5 | 100% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 150 | 100 | 50% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 67% more |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1 | 100% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 100% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 0.5 | 100% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 0.6 | 33% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Djibouti (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 50 | 100% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 67% more |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 5 | 100% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Djibouti (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 500 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 800 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,200 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Djibouti is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and dining experiences\n- Access to international schools and education\n- Modern healthcare facilities and services\n- Tourist infrastructure and activities\n- **Somalia is cheaper for:**\n- Local transportation and taxi fares\n- Traditional clothing and handicrafts\n- Fresh produce and meat at local markets\n- Renting a house or apartment outside of major cities\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats and foreigners, Djibouti may offer a more comfortable and convenient living experience, despite the higher costs. The country has a more developed infrastructure, a stronger economy, and a more diverse range of goods and services. However, Somalia can be a more affordable option for those on a tight budget, particularly for locals and entrepreneurs who are willing to navigate the country's challenges. For students and young travelers, Somalia may offer a more exciting and immersive cultural experience, with a unique opportunity to engage with local communities and learn about the country's history and traditions. Ultimately, the choice between Djibouti and Somalia depends on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences.\n\nIn terms of value for money, Djibouti may be a better option for those who prioritize convenience, comfort, and access to modern amenities. However, Somalia can offer a more authentic and immersive experience for those who are willing to adapt to local customs and way of life. For retirees and families, Djibouti may be a more suitable choice, with a more developed healthcare system and a wider range of educational and recreational activities. However, Somalia's warm and welcoming culture, combined with its stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage, can make it an attractive option for those who are looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.",
