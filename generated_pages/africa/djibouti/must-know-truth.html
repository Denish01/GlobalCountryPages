        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Djibouti, a sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa, has a rich and complex history. The territory was inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the <strong>Somali</strong> and <strong>Afar</strong>, long before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1896, the area became a French colony, known as French Somaliland, and was officially declared a territory of France. The country gained independence from France on June 27, 1977, after a long struggle for self-rule. The newly independent nation was named the Republic of Djibouti, with <strong>Hassan Gouled Aptidon</strong> as its first president.</p>
        <p>The early years of independence were marked by a fragile economy and a lack of infrastructure. However, the country's strategic location, with access to the <strong>Bab-el-Mandeb</strong> strait, made it an important hub for international trade and commerce. In the 1990s, Djibouti experienced a civil war, which lasted for several years and had a significant impact on the country's development. The conflict was eventually resolved through a peace agreement, and the country has since made progress in rebuilding its economy and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Djibouti's history is also marked by its relationships with neighboring countries, including <strong>Eritrea</strong>, <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, and <strong>Somalia</strong>. The country has played a key role in regional affairs, hosting international meetings and conferences, and has been a member of various regional organizations, including the <strong>African Union</strong> and the <strong>Arab League</strong>. Today, Djibouti continues to navigate the complexities of regional politics, while working to develop its economy and improve the lives of its citizens.</p>
        <p>Djibouti's cultural heritage is a unique blend of African, Arab, and French influences. The country's strategic location has made it a crossroads for trade and cultural exchange, with a diverse population that reflects its history as a colonial territory. The official languages of Djibouti are <strong>French</strong> and <strong>Arabic</strong>, although <strong>Somali</strong> and <strong>Afar</strong> are also widely spoken. The country's cuisine, music, and art all reflect its rich cultural diversity, with a blend of traditional and modern influences.</p>
