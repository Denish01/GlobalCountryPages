[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Djibouti's government is characterized by a strong presidency, with the president holding significant executive powers. The president is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to a maximum of two terms. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, with each branch having distinct roles and responsibilities. The executive branch is headed by the president, who appoints the prime minister and other ministers. The legislative branch is composed of the National Assembly, a unicameral body with 65 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The judicial branch is independent and comprises the Supreme Court and lower courts.

The **unitary system** of government in Djibouti means that the central government has significant powers and authority, with limited autonomy granted to regional and local authorities. This has contributed to a relatively stable political environment, with the government able to implement policies and projects effectively. However, it has also been criticized for limiting opportunities for **decentralization** and **participation** at the local level.

The **political system** in Djibouti has undergone significant changes since independence in 1977. The country has transitioned from a single-party system to a multi-party system, with several parties participating in elections. However, the ruling **Union for the Presidential Majority** (UMP) has dominated politics, with the president and his allies holding significant influence over the government and the economy.
