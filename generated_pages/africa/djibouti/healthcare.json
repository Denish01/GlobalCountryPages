  "content": "Healthcare in Djibouti is a mixed system that faces challenges in providing quality care to its population, with a significant disparity between urban and rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 17\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Djibouti is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, which includes hospitals, health centers, and dispensaries. However, the quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with **Djibouti City** having better-equipped and staffed facilities. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a shortage of medical supplies and equipment. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better-quality care but are often expensive and out of reach for the average citizen.\n\nThe healthcare system in Djibouti faces several challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of access to healthcare services in rural areas. The country also struggles with a high prevalence of **infectious diseases** such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding for healthcare and implementing programs to improve access to healthcare services.\n\nIn recent years, Djibouti has made progress in improving its healthcare system, including the construction of new hospitals and health centers. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas. The government has also implemented programs to improve the training and retention of healthcare professionals, which is critical to improving the quality of care.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Peltier General Hospital | Djibouti City | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Bouffard Hospital | Djibouti City | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Balbala Health Center | Balbala | Public | Primary care, maternal health | Limited |\n| Ali Sabieh Hospital | Ali Sabieh | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| European Military Hospital | Djibouti City | Private | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Yes |\n| Al-Rahma Private Hospital | Djibouti City | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expatriates, as it provides access to better-quality care and coverage for emergency medical evacuations.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but they may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** plans are available from companies such as **Allianz** and **AXA**, which provide comprehensive coverage for medical expenses, including hospitalization, surgery, and emergency medical evacuations.\n- The cost of health insurance in Djibouti varies depending on the provider and the level of coverage, but it can range from $500 to $2,000 per year.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors, as it provides coverage for emergency medical expenses and evacuations.\n- **Group health insurance** plans are available for companies and organizations, which provide comprehensive coverage for employees and their families.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacies** are available in urban areas, but they may not always have a wide range of medications in stock.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but some medications may require a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including **European** and **American** brands.\n- **Costs** of medications can be high, especially for specialty medications.\n- **Generic medications** are available, but they may not always be of the same quality as brand-name medications.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for all travelers to Djibouti.\n- **Hepatitis A and B vaccinations** are recommended for all travelers.\n- **Malaria prophylaxis** is recommended for travelers to rural areas.\n- **Typhoid vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Rabies vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be spending time around animals.\n- **Cholera vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be working in healthcare or with vulnerable populations.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Djibouti** is not a major destination for medical tourism, but some private hospitals and clinics may offer specialized services such as **cosmetic surgery** and **dental care**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** such as the **European Military Hospital** and **Bouffard Hospital** may offer high-quality medical care, but they may not always have the same level of expertise as hospitals in other countries.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for certain procedures, but they may not always be significant.\n- **Language barriers** may be a challenge for medical tourists, as not all healthcare professionals speak English fluently.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, call the **emergency number** 17 or go to the nearest hospital.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can be a challenge, especially in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may not always have the necessary equipment or staff to handle emergencies.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, so it is recommended to have a **local contact** who can assist with the process.\n- **Emergency medical evacuations** may be necessary in some cases, and **travel insurance** can provide coverage for these expenses.\n- **Local healthcare providers** may not always have the same level of expertise as healthcare providers in other countries, so it is recommended to research and plan ahead for emergency situations.",
