[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Djibouti's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest and most accessible. The language of instruction is primarily French, with Arabic also being taught in some schools. The public education system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, with limited resources and outdated curricula. However, the government has been working to improve the public education system, with efforts to increase access to education and improve teacher training. Compulsory education in Djibouti lasts for 9 years, from ages 6 to 15, and is free for all citizens.

Despite the challenges facing the public education system, there are some high-quality private schools in Djibouti, particularly in the capital city. These schools often have better resources and more qualified teachers, and may offer a range of curricula, including French, American, and British systems. International schools are also available in Djibouti, catering to the children of expatriates and diplomats. These schools typically offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).
