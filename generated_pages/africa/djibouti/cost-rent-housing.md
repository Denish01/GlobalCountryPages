[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Djibouti's housing market is relatively small and competitive, with a high demand for rentals in the city center. The rental market is primarily driven by expatriates and foreign workers, which has led to an increase in prices over the years. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and it is essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Djibouti's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center.

The housing market in Djibouti is also influenced by the country's strategic location and its role as a major port and trade hub. The city's infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with modern amenities and services available. However, the cost of living in Djibouti can be high, particularly for expatriates and foreigners. The government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, but the demand for housing remains high, particularly in the city center.
