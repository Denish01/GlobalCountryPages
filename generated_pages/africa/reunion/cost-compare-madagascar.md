[SECTION] Overview: Reunion vs Madagascar [/SECTION]
Reunion, an overseas department of France, and Madagascar, an independent island nation, are two distinct entities in the Indian Ocean. The cost of living in Reunion is significantly higher than in Madagascar, primarily due to its connection to France and the subsequent adoption of the Euro as its currency. This has led to higher prices for goods and services, making Reunion one of the more expensive destinations in the region. In contrast, Madagascar, with its lower GDP per capita and higher inflation rate, offers a more affordable lifestyle. The overall cost of living in Madagascar is approximately 30-50% lower than in Reunion, making it an attractive option for those seeking a more budget-friendly experience.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Reunion's economy is heavily influenced by France, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing. This has led to a higher standard of living and, consequently, higher prices. Madagascar, on the other hand, has a more diverse economy, with a mix of agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, but its overall economic development is still in its early stages. As a result, the cost of living in Madagascar is lower, but the country still offers a unique and rewarding experience for visitors and expats alike.
