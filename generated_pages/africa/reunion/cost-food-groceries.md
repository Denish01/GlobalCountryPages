[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Reunion can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a **supermarket** or a **local market**. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price point. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and other staples at competitive prices, but with a more limited selection. When shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to **haggle** over prices, as vendors often expect customers to negotiate. In general, it's best to buy fresh produce and other staples at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods and imported items.

In terms of price difference, local markets can offer savings of up to 50% compared to supermarkets. For example, a kilogram of tomatoes might cost $3-$5 at a supermarket, but only $2-$3 at a local market. However, the quality and freshness of the produce can vary depending on the vendor and the time of day. It's a good idea to shop early in the morning or later in the evening to get the best selection and prices.
