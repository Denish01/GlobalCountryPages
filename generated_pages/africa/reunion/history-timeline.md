The history of Reunion is a complex and multifaceted narrative that spans centuries, from the earliest known human habitation to the present day, with significant events and periods shaping the island's development into the overseas department of France it is today.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
Reunion, an island located in the Indian Ocean, has a history that dates back to the 17th century when it was first inhabited by humans. The earliest known inhabitants of the island were **Malagasy** and **African** slaves who were brought to the island by **European** colonizers. In 1642, the French East India Company took possession of the island, and it became a French colony in 1664. The island's strategic location made it an important stopover for ships traveling between Europe and Asia, and it quickly developed into a major commercial center. The French established **sugar plantations** on the island, which became the mainstay of the economy, and the island's population grew rapidly as a result of the influx of slaves and indentured servants from Africa and Asia.

During the **French Revolution**, Reunion remained loyal to the French crown, and it was not until 1793 that the island was officially renamed Reunion.

The island became an overseas department of France in 1946, and it has since been governed as an integral part of France.
