# The Truth About Reunion - History & Real Facts

Reunion is a French overseas department and region in the Indian Ocean, with a unique cultural and geographical identity that is often misunderstood or overlooked by the general public. 

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Reunion was uninhabited when it was first discovered by European explorers in the early 16th century. The island was initially visited by the Portuguese, but it was the French who established the first permanent settlement in 1665. The island was named **Ile de la Reunion** in 1793, and it became a French colony in 1815. Reunion remained a French colony until 1946, when it became an overseas department of France, a status that it still holds today. The island's history has been shaped by its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, which made it an important stopover for ships traveling between Europe and Asia.

The French established a system of slavery on the island, which lasted until 1848, when slavery was abolished. After the abolition of slavery, the French brought in indentured servants from India, China, and Africa to work on the island's sugar plantations. This diverse group of people has contributed to the unique cultural identity of Reunion, which is a blend of French, African, Indian, and Chinese influences. Today, Reunion is a **French overseas department and region**, with a population of approximately 896,175 people.

Reunion's history has also been shaped by its geography, which is characterized by a rugged terrain and a tropical climate. The island is home to a number of active volcanoes, including **Piton de la Fournaise**, which is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. The island's unique geography and climate have made it a popular destination for tourists, who come to enjoy the island's beautiful beaches, lush forests, and rugged landscapes.

Reunion's economy has historically been based on agriculture, with sugar, vanilla, and geranium oil being some of the island's main exports. However, in recent years, the island has diversified its economy, with tourism and services becoming increasingly important sectors. The island's economy is closely tied to that of France, and the **euro** is the official currency.
