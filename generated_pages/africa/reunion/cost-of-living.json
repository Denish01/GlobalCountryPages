[/SECTION]\nReunion, an overseas department of France, has a high cost of living, driven by its remote location and reliance on imports. The island's economy is heavily influenced by its French connection, which contributes to the elevated prices of goods and services. Compared to its neighbors, Madagascar and Mauritius, Reunion is significantly more expensive, making it a less attractive option for travelers on a tight budget. However, the island's unique cultural heritage, stunning natural beauty, and modern infrastructure make it an appealing destination for those willing to spend a bit more.\n\nThe cost of living in Reunion is also affected by the island's limited economy, which is largely dependent on tourism, agriculture, and services. The prices of basic necessities, such as food and transportation, are relatively high, and the cost of accommodation can be steep, especially in popular areas like Saint-Denis and Saint-Pierre. Nevertheless, with some planning and research, visitors can still find ways to experience the best of Reunion without breaking the bank.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-60 | Basic dorms and guesthouses, often with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $100-200 | Comfortable hotels with private bathrooms and amenities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $250-500 | High-end resorts with upscale amenities and services |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $800-1,500 | City center apartments, with prices varying depending on location and size |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-20 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-40 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $50-100 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-6 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-4 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-2 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-5 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-3.00 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 600 | 1,200 | 2,000 |\n| Food | 500 | 800 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 150 | 250 | 350 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **1,650** | **2,950** | **4,450** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in a hostel or guesthouse outside of the city center to save on accommodation costs.\n- Eat at local markets or street food stalls to enjoy affordable and delicious Creole cuisine.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce transport expenses.\n- Take advantage of free outdoor activities, such as visiting the island's beautiful beaches or hiking in the cirques.\n- Shop at local markets or supermarkets for groceries and other essentials to avoid tourist-oriented prices.\n- Look for package deals or discounts on activities and tours to make the most of your budget.",
