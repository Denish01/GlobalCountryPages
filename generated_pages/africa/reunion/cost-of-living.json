[/SECTION]\nReunion, as an overseas department of France, has a cost of living that is comparable to that of Western Europe, but with some variations due to its unique location in the Indian Ocean. The island's economy is heavily influenced by its French connection, which means that prices for many goods and services are similar to those found in metropolitan France. However, the cost of living in Reunion is also affected by its remote location, which can drive up the cost of imported goods. Compared to its neighbors, Madagascar and Mauritius, Reunion is generally more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food.\n\nThe cost of living in Reunion can vary depending on the location, with the capital city of Saint-Denis and other urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas. Additionally, the island's popularity as a tourist destination means that prices can be higher during peak season, which typically runs from June to September. Overall, Reunion offers a unique blend of French and African influences, making it an attractive destination for travelers, but also one that requires a moderate to high budget.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $20-40 | Basic dorms and guesthouses, often with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $80-150 | Comfortable hotels and resorts, with private bathrooms and amenities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $200-400 | High-end resorts and hotels, with full range of amenities and services |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $400-800 | City center, 1-bedroom apartment, prices vary depending on location and amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-70 |\n| Fine Dining | $80-150 |\n| Beer (local) | $3-5 |\n| Coffee | $2-4 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-2 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 400 | 700 | 1,200 |\n| Food | 300 | 600 | 1,000 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **1,100** | **2,100** | **3,400** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting Reunion during the off-season, from October to May, when prices for accommodation and flights tend to be lower.\n- Look for accommodation options outside of the capital city, such as in smaller towns or rural areas, where prices tend to be lower.\n- Eat at local markets or street food stalls, where you can find affordable and delicious meals.\n- Use public transportation, such as buses, instead of taxis or rental cars, to get around the island.\n- Take advantage of the island's many free or low-cost activities, such as hiking, visiting beaches, and exploring the capital city.\n- Consider purchasing a **Carte de Séjour**, a special card that offers discounts and perks for tourists, such as free entry to museums and national parks.",
