[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The political system of Reunion is based on the French model, with a **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. As an overseas department and region of France, Reunion has a significant degree of autonomy, but the French government retains responsibility for defense, foreign affairs, and some domestic policies. The Reunion Regional Council and the Reunion Departmental Council are the two main legislative bodies, with 45 seats each. The Prefect of Reunion, appointed by the French government, serves as the head of the executive branch.

The **unitary system** of France applies to Reunion, with the French government holding significant authority over the island. However, Reunion has a degree of autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic development. The Reunion Regional Council has the power to make decisions on regional matters, while the Reunion Departmental Council focuses on departmental issues.

The French **Constitution** applies to Reunion, and the island's inhabitants are French citizens with the same rights and obligations as those living in mainland France. Reunion is represented in the French National Assembly and the French Senate, with several deputies and senators elected to represent the island's interests.
