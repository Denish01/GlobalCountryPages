The primary modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and cars, with most people relying on their own vehicles or public buses to get around. The quality of public transit is generally good, with an extensive network of buses covering most areas of the island. However, the lack of a metro or subway system means that traffic congestion can be a problem, especially during peak hours.\n\nThe island's scenic roads and stunning landscapes make driving a popular option, but it's essential to be aware of the local driving customs and road conditions. Many locals also use bicycles or walk, especially in the smaller towns and villages, where the pace of life is more relaxed. With the island's compact size, it's relatively easy to get around without a car, and the public transportation system is generally efficient and affordable.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1.20 | $45 | Good coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2.50 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used for short distances |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.50 | $1.20 | $10-$15 | Available at airports and major towns |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.50 | $1.00 | $8-$12 | Uber, Bolt available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Saint-Denis city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, manual transmission |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in city centers |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, mainly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited services, mainly connecting major towns |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Reunion to other French territories, limited services |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass, which can be used on buses and other public transport.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Bolt for convenient and affordable transport, especially at night or in areas with limited public transport.\n- Be aware of traffic congestion, especially during peak hours, and plan your journey accordingly.\n- If driving, be mindful of local driving customs and road conditions, and consider renting a car with a manual transmission to save on fuel costs.\n- When taking a taxi, always use a metered taxi or negotiate the fare beforehand to avoid overcharging.\n- Download the **Citymapper** or **Moovit** app to plan your journey and get real-time information on public transport schedules and routes.",
