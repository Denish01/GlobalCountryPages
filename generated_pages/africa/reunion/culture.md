# Reunion Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

The culture of Reunion is a unique blend of French, African, Asian, and European influences, shaped by its history as a French overseas department and its strategic location in the Indian Ocean. 

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Reunion's culture is defined by its multicultural heritage, with a mix of French, African, Chinese, Indian, and Malay influences. The island's history as a French colony and its location at the crossroads of the Indian Ocean have created a distinct cultural identity. The population of Reunion is predominantly of European, African, and Asian descent, with a significant Creole population. The official language is French, but many residents also speak Creole, a language that reflects the island's diverse cultural influences.

The cultural identity of Reunion is also shaped by its history of slavery and immigration. African slaves were brought to the island by French colonizers, and later, indentured servants from India and China were also brought to work on the island's plantations. Today, the descendants of these immigrants continue to play an important role in shaping the island's culture. The island's cultural diversity is reflected in its music, dance, and art, which blend African, European, and Asian influences.

Reunion's cultural identity is also influenced by its geography and climate. The island's rugged landscape and tropical climate have created a unique cultural landscape, with a strong emphasis on outdoor activities such as hiking and water sports. The island's capital, Saint-Denis, is a bustling city with a rich cultural scene, featuring a mix of French, African, and Asian influences.
