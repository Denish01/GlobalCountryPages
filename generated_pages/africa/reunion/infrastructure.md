[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Reunion's infrastructure is characterized by a high level of development, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the island's transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications. The island's economy is driven by a combination of tourism, agriculture, and services, and its infrastructure is designed to support these industries. However, there is a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with the capital city Saint-Denis and other urban centers generally having better infrastructure than rural areas.

The French government has invested heavily in Reunion's infrastructure, with a focus on modernizing the island's transportation networks, including its roads, airports, and ports. This investment has helped to improve the island's connectivity and facilitate the growth of its economy. Despite these efforts, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need to improve access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation in rural areas.

Reunion's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and earthquakes, which can cause significant damage to the island's roads, buildings, and other infrastructure. As a result, there is a need for ongoing investment in disaster risk reduction and management measures, such as early warning systems and emergency response plans.
