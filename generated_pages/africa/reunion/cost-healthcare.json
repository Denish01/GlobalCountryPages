The public healthcare system is generally considered to be more affordable, with lower costs for doctor's visits and medical procedures. However, the private healthcare system is often preferred by foreigners and those seeking more specialized care, as it offers more modern facilities and equipment. For locals, the healthcare system is generally accessible and affordable, with many medical services and procedures covered by the French social security system. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high without it.\n\nThe healthcare system in Reunion is overseen by the French government, and as such, it follows many of the same standards and protocols as the French healthcare system. This means that medical facilities and personnel are generally of high quality, and that many medical procedures and services are available. However, there may be some differences in the way that healthcare is delivered, particularly in terms of the role of private healthcare providers. Overall, the healthcare system in Reunion is well-developed and capable of providing high-quality medical care to both locals and foreigners.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$30 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals and clinics offer lower-cost visits |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$50 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may charge more for consultations |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public dental clinics offer lower-cost checkups |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$30 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may charge more for exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals and clinics offer lower-cost blood tests |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals offer lower-cost emergency visits |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals may charge more for overnight stays |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Public hospitals offer lower-cost surgical procedures |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospitals may charge more for childbirth services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may charge more for MRI scans |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals and clinics offer lower-cost X-rays |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor's visits, hospital stays, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, private hospital stays, advanced medical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Worldwide coverage, emergency evacuations, advanced medical procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a doctor, with costs ranging from $10 to $50 per medication.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with costs ranging from $5 to $20 per medication.\n- Public pharmacies offer lower-cost medications, with prices regulated by the French government.\n- Private pharmacies may charge more for medications, particularly for specialty or imported medications.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a specialist or a specific type of doctor.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less accessible in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 15, or to visit the emergency room at a public hospital.

These hospitals often have staff who speak English and other languages, and may be more familiar with the medical needs of foreigners. However, public hospitals are also capable of providing high-quality medical care, and may be more affordable for those without insurance. In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to seek care at the nearest hospital, regardless of whether it is public or private.
