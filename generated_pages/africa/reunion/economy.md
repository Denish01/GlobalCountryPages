[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Reunion's economy is classified as an upper-middle-income economy, with a high standard of living and a strong social safety net, thanks to its connection to France. The island's economy has experienced steady growth over the past few decades, driven by investments in infrastructure, tourism, and agriculture. However, the economy still faces challenges such as high unemployment, particularly among young people, and a dependence on imports. Reunion's economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in European trade policies.

The island's economic development is also influenced by its unique cultural and geographical context. Reunion is a multicultural society with a mix of European, African, and Asian influences, which has created a dynamic and diverse economy. The island's stunning natural beauty, with its volcanic landscapes, rainforests, and coral reefs, also makes it an attractive destination for tourists. However, the economy's growth trajectory is also affected by its limited size and resources, which can make it difficult to achieve economies of scale and diversify the economy.

Reunion's economy is also closely tied to the European economy, and the island has benefited from its membership in the European Union. The island receives significant funding from the EU for development projects, and its economy is closely integrated with the French economy. However, this also means that Reunion's economy is subject to EU regulations and policies, which can sometimes limit its ability to pursue its own economic development strategies.
