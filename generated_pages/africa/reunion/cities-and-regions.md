Reunion is an overseas department of France, and as such, it is divided into four main departments: Saint-Benoît, Saint-Denis, Saint-Pierre, and Saint-Paul. These departments are further divided into 24 communes, each with its own mayor and local government. The departments are responsible for providing various public services, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the communes focus on local issues such as waste management, public transportation, and community development.
