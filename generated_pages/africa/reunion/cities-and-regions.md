[SECTION] How Reunion Is Divided [/SECTION]
Reunion is an overseas department of France, and as such, it is divided into four arrondissements, which are further subdivided into 24 communes. The arrondissements are responsible for providing various public services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, to the local population. The capital, Saint-Denis, is located in the north of the island and is the largest city, with a population of over 146,000 people. The other main cities, such as Saint-Pierre and Saint-Paul, are also important economic and cultural centers.

The administrative structure of Reunion is similar to that of other French overseas departments, with a prefect appointed by the French government to oversee the administration of the island. The local government, known as the Conseil Départemental, is responsible for making decisions on matters such as education, transportation, and economic development. This system allows for a balance between local autonomy and national oversight, ensuring that Reunion is well-integrated into the French republic while still maintaining its unique cultural identity.
