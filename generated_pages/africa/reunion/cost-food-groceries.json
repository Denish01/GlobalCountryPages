The cost of living in Reunion is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which affects the prices of groceries and other essential items. Despite this, the local culture emphasizes home cooking, with many residents preparing traditional Creole dishes using fresh ingredients from the market. Eating out is also a popular option, with a range of restaurants serving everything from street food to fine dining. The **French influence** on the island's cuisine is evident in the use of high-quality ingredients and traditional cooking techniques.\n\nThe prices of food in Reunion can fluctuate depending on the season and availability of ingredients. Fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, are generally more expensive than staple items like rice and pasta. Meat and seafood are also popular ingredients in Reunionese cuisine, but can be pricey due to the high cost of imports. However, the island's **local markets** offer a range of affordable options for fresh produce, with many vendors selling their wares at competitive prices.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2-$3 | 1.8-2.5 EUR | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2-$3 | 1.5-2.5 EUR | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $3-$4 | 2.5-3.5 EUR | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 1.5-2.5 EUR | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $10-$15 | 8-12 EUR | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $15-$20 | 12-16 EUR | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 4-6 EUR | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3-$5 | 2.5-4 EUR | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 1.5-2.5 EUR | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 1.5-2.5 EUR | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $15-$20 | 12-16 EUR | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-$3 | 1.5-2.5 EUR | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | (typical dishes like **bouillon** or **samoussas**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$30 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$120 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $7-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $5-$7 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $3-$5 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Reunion can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a **supermarket** or a **local market**. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price point. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and other staples at competitive prices, but with a more limited selection. When shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to **haggle** over prices, as vendors often expect customers to negotiate. In general, it's best to buy fresh produce and other staples at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods and imported items.\n\nIn terms of price difference, local markets can offer savings of up to 50% compared to supermarkets. For example, a kilogram of tomatoes might cost $3-$5 at a supermarket, but only $2-$3 at a local market. However, the quality and freshness of the produce can vary depending on the vendor and the time of day. It's a good idea to shop early in the morning or later in the evening to get the best selection and prices.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Reunion is to buy **street food** from local vendors, with prices starting from around $5-$10 USD per meal.\n- **Rice and beans** are staple ingredients in Reunionese cuisine and offer good value for money.\n- **Fresh seafood** is abundant in Reunion and can be purchased at a relatively low cost, especially at local markets.\n- **Imported goods**, such as meat and dairy products, tend to be more expensive than local alternatives.\n- **Local cheese** and **wine** are popular products in Reunion and offer a range of affordable options.\n- To save money, consider **cooking at home** using fresh ingredients from local markets, rather than eating out at restaurants.",
