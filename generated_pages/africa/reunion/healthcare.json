  "content": "Healthcare in Reunion is generally of high quality, with a well-organized system and easy access to medical facilities, especially in urban areas like Saint-Denis.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: High\nEmergency Number: 15\nHospital Standard: Excellent\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Reunion is based on the French model, with a strong emphasis on public healthcare. The system is universal, meaning that all residents have access to medical care, regardless of their income or social status. The quality of care is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, there can be some differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped hospitals and more specialized medical professionals. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions, with patients typically required to pay a small fee for consultations and treatments.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Reunion is complemented by a private sector, with many private hospitals and clinics offering specialized care and shorter waiting times. However, private healthcare is generally more expensive than public healthcare, and may not be covered by the universal healthcare system. Overall, the healthcare system in Reunion is well-organized and provides high-quality care, making it an attractive destination for medical tourism.\n\nIn terms of access to healthcare, urban areas like Saint-Denis tend to have better access to medical facilities and specialized care, while rural areas may have more limited options.
