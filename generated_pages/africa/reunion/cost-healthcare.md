[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Reunion's healthcare system is considered to be of high quality, with both public and private options available. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be more affordable, with lower costs for doctor's visits and medical procedures.

For locals, the healthcare system is generally accessible and affordable, with many medical services and procedures covered by the French social security system. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high without it.
