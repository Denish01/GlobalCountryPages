[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Reunion, an overseas department of France located in the Indian Ocean, offers a range of transportation options for getting around the island. The primary modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and cars, with most people relying on their own vehicles or public buses to get around. The quality of public transit is generally good, with an extensive network of buses covering most areas of the island. However, the lack of a metro or subway system means that traffic congestion can be a problem, especially during peak hours.

The island's scenic roads and stunning landscapes make driving a popular option, but it's essential to be aware of the local driving customs and road conditions. Many locals also use bicycles or walk, especially in the smaller towns and villages, where the pace of life is more relaxed. With the island's compact size, it's relatively easy to get around without a car, and the public transportation system is generally efficient and affordable.
