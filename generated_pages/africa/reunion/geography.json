  "content": "Reunion is an island territory located in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar, and is a part of France, offering a unique blend of French and African cultures.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLand Area: 2,511 km², about the size of the state of Rhode Island\nHighest Point: Piton des Neiges, 3,070 meters\nLowest Point: Indian Ocean, 0 meters\nCoastline: 207 km\nBorders: none, but neighbors Madagascar and Mauritius\nClimate Type: tropical\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]\nReunion is situated in the Indian Ocean, approximately 200 kilometers east of Madagascar and 230 kilometers southwest of Mauritius. The island is part of the Mascarene archipelago, which also includes Mauritius and Rodrigues. Reunion is a French overseas department and region, and as such, it is not bordered by any country but is surrounded by the Indian Ocean. The island's strategic location has made it an important stopover for trade and travel between Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe island's proximity to Madagascar and Mauritius has also contributed to its unique cultural and geographical characteristics. Reunion's landscape and climate are shaped by its tropical location and its volcanic origin, which has created a diverse range of ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to coastal plains. The island's coastline is marked by numerous beaches, coves, and bays, which provide a habitat for a wide range of marine life. The ocean surrounding Reunion is also home to several coral reefs, which are popular with divers and snorkelers.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nReunion's terrain is characterized by its volcanic origin, with two major volcanic peaks, Piton des Neiges and Piton de la Fournaise, dominating the island's landscape. The highest point, Piton des Neiges, is an extinct volcano that rises to an elevation of 3,070 meters, while Piton de la Fournaise is an active volcano that is still erupting today. The island's interior is marked by a series of valleys, ravines, and plateaus, which are covered in a lush tropical vegetation. The coastal areas are generally flat, with numerous beaches and coves, while the western coast is marked by a series of steep cliffs and rocky shores.\n\nThe island's volcanic origin has also created a unique landscape of volcanic ash, lava flows, and volcanic rocks. The interior of the island is home to several forests, including the Bebour Forest and the Bélouve Forest, which are characterized by their lush vegetation and diverse wildlife. The forests are also home to several waterfalls, including the famous Trou de Fer waterfall, which is one of the highest waterfalls in the world. The coastal areas are also marked by several mangrove swamps, which provide a habitat for a wide range of marine life.\n\nReunion's landscape is also shaped by its tropical climate, with high levels of rainfall and humidity throughout the year. The island's geography has created a series of microclimates, with different regions experiencing different levels of rainfall and temperature. The western coast is generally drier than the eastern coast, while the interior of the island is cooler than the coastal areas.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION] \nis already used so it is removed and this content is added to the previous section.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Summer | December to March | 25-30°C | high | hot and humid |\n| Autumn | April to June | 20-25°C | moderate | mild and pleasant |\n| Winter | July to September | 15-20°C | low | cool and dry |\n| Spring | October to November | 20-25°C | moderate | warm and sunny |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: April to June and October to November.
