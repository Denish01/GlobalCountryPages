[SECTION] How Expensive Is Reunion? [/SECTION]
Reunion, as an overseas department of France, has a cost of living that is comparable to that of Western Europe, but with some variations due to its unique location in the Indian Ocean. The island's economy is heavily influenced by its French connection, which means that prices for many goods and services are similar to those found in metropolitan France. However, the cost of living in Reunion is also affected by its remote location, which can drive up the cost of imported goods. Compared to its neighbors, Madagascar and Mauritius, Reunion is generally more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food.

The cost of living in Reunion can vary depending on the location, with the capital city of Saint-Denis and other urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas. Additionally, the island's popularity as a tourist destination means that prices can be higher during peak season, which typically runs from June to September. Overall, Reunion offers a unique blend of French and African influences, making it an attractive destination for travelers, but also one that requires a moderate to high budget.
