The island's cuisine is characterized by the use of fresh seafood, tropical fruits, and spices, which are often combined with French techniques and ingredients. The **Creole** culture, which is a blend of African, European, and Asian influences, plays a significant role in shaping the island's culinary traditions. Regional variations can be seen in the different districts of the island, with the north being known for its **civet de sanglier** (wild boar stew) and the south being famous for its **poulet au curry** (chicken curry).\n\nThe island's cuisine is also influenced by its history as a French colony, which is reflected in the use of French ingredients and cooking techniques. However, the African and Asian influences are also evident, particularly in the use of spices and chilies. The **street food** scene in Reunion is also worth exploring, with popular dishes such as **samoussas** (meat or vegetable-filled pastries) and **bouchons** (deep-fried dough balls) being sold at markets and food stalls.\n\nReunion's cuisine is not just about the food, but also about the cultural and social context in which it is consumed. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds. The island's cuisine is also closely tied to its festivals and celebrations, such as the **Festival Kreol**, which showcases the island's Creole culture and cuisine.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Carri Poulet | Curry | Chicken curry made with coconut milk and spices | Restaurants in Saint-Denis and Saint-Pierre |\n| Rougail | Stew | Fish stew made with tomatoes, onions, and chilies | Seafood restaurants in the coastal towns |\n| Bouillon Brede | Soup | Soup made with leafy greens and meat or fish | Local markets and food stalls |\n| Civet de Sanglier | Stew | Wild boar stew made with mushrooms and spices | Restaurants in the northern districts |\n| Poulet au Curry | Curry | Chicken curry made with coconut milk and spices | Restaurants in the southern districts |\n| Samoussas | Snack | Meat or vegetable-filled pastries | Markets and food stalls |\n| Bouchons | Snack | Deep-fried dough balls | Markets and food stalls |\n| Dhal Puri | Flatbread | Flatbread made with lentils and spices | Indian restaurants in Saint-Denis |\n| Achards | Side dish | Pickled vegetables made with chilies and spices | Local markets and food stalls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Samoussas**: meat or vegetable-filled pastries, $2-$3 USD\n- **Bouchons**: deep-fried dough balls, $1-$2 USD\n- **Achards**: pickled vegetables made with chilies and spices, $1-$2 USD\n- **Dhal Puri**: flatbread made with lentils and spices, $2-$3 USD\n- **Poulet au Curry**: chicken curry made with coconut milk and spices, $5-$7 USD\n- **Fresh fruit**: tropical fruits such as mangoes, pineapples, and bananas, $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Rum**: a popular spirit made from sugarcane, $5-$10 USD per bottle\n- **Fresh coconut water**: a refreshing and hydrating drink, $1-$2 USD\n- **Fresh fruit juices**: juices made from tropical fruits such as mangoes, pineapples, and bananas, $2-$3 USD\n- **Coffee**: a strong and rich coffee made from locally-grown beans, $1-$2 USD\n- **Tea**: a variety of teas made from locally-grown herbs and spices, $1-$2 USD\n- **Fresh lime juice**: a refreshing and tangy drink, $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with your hands**: it is common to eat with your hands, especially when eating traditional dishes such as **cari** and **rougail**\n- **Tipping**: 5-10% is customary in restaurants and bars\n- **Reservation culture**: reservations are not always necessary, but it is recommended to book ahead for popular restaurants\n- **Dress code**: casual dress is acceptable in most restaurants, but some upscale establishments may require formal attire\n- **Mealtime etiquette**: mealtimes are seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds, so be sure to engage in conversation and enjoy the company of your hosts\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Restaurants**: a wide range of restaurants serving French, Creole, and international cuisine, $10-$30 USD per meal\n- **Markets**: local markets selling fresh produce, meat, and seafood, $5-$10 USD per meal\n- **Food stalls**: street food stalls selling traditional dishes such as **samoussas** and **bouchons**, $2-$5 USD per meal\n- **Food courts**: food courts in shopping centers and markets, $5-$10 USD per meal\n- **Cafes**: cafes serving coffee, tea, and light meals, $5-$10 USD per meal\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Marche de Saint-Denis**: a bustling market selling fresh produce, meat, and seafood, located in the heart of Saint-Denis\n- **Marche de Saint-Pierre**: a market selling local handicrafts and souvenirs, as well as fresh produce and street food, located in the town of Saint-Pierre\n- **Festival Kreol**: a festival showcasing the island's Creole culture and cuisine, held annually in October\n- **Reunion Food Festival**: a festival celebrating the island's cuisine and wine, held annually in November\n- **La Maison de la Vanille**: a vanilla plantation and museum offering tours and tastings, located in the town of Saint-Andre",
