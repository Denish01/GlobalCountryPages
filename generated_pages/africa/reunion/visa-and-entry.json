[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nReunion, being an overseas department of France, has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of around 100 countries required to obtain a visa before arrival. However, EU citizens, as well as citizens of a few other countries, can enter Reunion visa-free for tourism and business purposes. The visa policy is largely aligned with that of France, and the types of visas available include tourist, business, student, and work visas. Reunion's unique location in the Indian Ocean, close to Madagascar and Mauritius, makes it an attractive destination for tourists and business travelers alike.\n\nThe visa policy of Reunion is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel and trade with the need to ensure the security and integrity of the territory. As a result, the visa requirements and regulations can be complex, and it's essential to understand the specific requirements for your nationality and purpose of visit. Reunion's visa policy is also influenced by its membership in the Schengen Area, which means that citizens of certain countries may need to obtain a Schengen visa to enter Reunion.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Passport must be valid for at least six months beyond intended stay |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Passport must be valid for at least six months beyond intended stay |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Passport or national ID card required |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Passport must be valid for at least six months beyond intended stay |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Passport must be valid for at least six months beyond intended stay |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online at least 72 hours before arrival |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Visa | 30 days | Must apply at a French embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can stay in Reunion for up to 90 days without a visa, provided they have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds.
