[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Reunion has a tropical monsoon climate, with two main seasons: a hot and wet season from November to March, and a cooler and drier season from April to October. The island is divided into three climate zones: the coastal areas, which are hot and humid; the mountainous regions, which are cooler and more temperate; and the highlands, which are cool and misty. The dry season is the best time to visit Reunion, as the weather is pleasant and there are fewer **cyclones**, which can occur during the wet season. The dry season is also the peak tourist season, with many visitors flocking to the island to enjoy the beautiful beaches, hiking trails, and outdoor activities.

The wet season, on the other hand, is characterized by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. However, the wet season is also the best time to see the island's **waterfalls** and **rainforests** in full bloom. The wet season is also the low season for tourism, which means that prices for accommodations and tourist services are lower. The shoulder season, which falls in April to June and September to November, is a good time to visit Reunion if you want to avoid the crowds and high prices of the peak season.

Reunion's unique geography and climate make it an attractive destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with its rugged landscape, beautiful beaches, and diverse wildlife. The island's **Pitons**, **cirques**, and **plaine** offer a range of hiking trails, scenic views, and opportunities for exploration. The dry season is the best time to explore these areas, as the weather is cooler and drier, making it easier to hike and sightsee.
