[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Sao Tome and Principe is relatively small and competitive, with a limited supply of high-quality housing. Typical lease terms are one to two years, and deposit requirements can range from one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract and to understand the terms and conditions before signing. Compared to regional neighbors like Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe's housing costs are relatively moderate. However, the country's remote location and limited infrastructure can make it challenging to find affordable and quality housing, especially for expats.

The housing market in Sao Tome and Principe is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including a high inflation rate of 14.3% and a relatively low GDP per capita. As a result, the demand for housing is largely driven by the local population, with a limited number of expats and foreigners living in the country. Despite these challenges, Sao Tome and Principe's housing market offers a unique opportunity for those looking to experience a tranquil and picturesque island lifestyle.
