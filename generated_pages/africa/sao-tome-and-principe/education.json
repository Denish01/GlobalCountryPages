  "content": "The education system in Sao Tome and Principe is based on the Portuguese model, with a focus on providing free and compulsory education to all citizens, and students can study at various institutions, including universities and international schools, to pursue their academic and professional goals.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 74.9%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Portuguese\nAcademic Calendar: October to July\nInternational Schools: limited\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 5 universities in the region\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Sao Tome and Principe is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **ensino básico**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, and is divided into two cycles. The first cycle, **ensino básico 1**, lasts for 4 years and focuses on basic subjects such as Portuguese, mathematics, and science. The second cycle, **ensino básico 2**, lasts for 2 years and introduces more specialized subjects such as history, geography, and foreign languages. Secondary education, also known as **ensino secundário**, is not compulsory, but is required for students who wish to pursue higher education. It lasts for 3 years and provides students with a more advanced education in a variety of subjects. Tertiary education, also known as **ensino superior**, is provided by the country's only public university, the **Universidade de São Tomé e Príncipe**, as well as several private institutions.\n\nThe quality of education in Sao Tome and Principe is a major concern, as the country faces significant challenges in terms of inadequate infrastructure, lack of qualified teachers, and limited resources. However, the government has been working to improve the education system, with a focus on increasing access to education, improving the quality of teaching, and expanding vocational training programs. Public education is free and compulsory, but many students attend private schools, which are often considered to be of higher quality. The **Ministério da Educação e Cultura** is responsible for overseeing the education system and implementing education policies.\n\nDespite the challenges it faces, the education system in Sao Tome and Principe has made significant progress in recent years, with an increase in enrollment rates and a decrease in dropout rates. However, more needs to be done to address the systemic issues that affect the quality of education, such as inadequate funding, lack of qualified teachers, and limited resources. The government has been working to address these issues, with a focus on increasing investment in education and implementing reforms to improve the quality of teaching and learning.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
