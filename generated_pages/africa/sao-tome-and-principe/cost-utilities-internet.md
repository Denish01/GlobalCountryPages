[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Sao Tome and Principe is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages. As a result, costs can fluctuate, and residents often rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators. The country's high inflation rate of 14.3% also contributes to the instability of utility prices. Seasonal variation plays a role, with higher electricity costs during the dry season due to increased demand for air conditioning and lower water costs during the rainy season.

The quality of utility services in Sao Tome and Principe is affected by the country's limited resources and infrastructure. The government has been working to improve the utility sector, but challenges persist. Residents often experience interruptions in service, particularly during peak hours. Despite these challenges, the cost of utilities in Sao Tome and Principe is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. However, the high inflation rate and limited availability of certain services, such as gas and heating, can make it difficult for residents to budget for their utility costs.
