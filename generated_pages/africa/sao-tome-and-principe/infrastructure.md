Major Ports: 1
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Sao Tome and Principe's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other African countries. The country has made efforts to improve its infrastructure in recent years, with investments in the energy and transportation sectors. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The capital city, Sao Tome, has a relatively higher level of infrastructure development, with access to most basic services, but the rest of the country lags behind.

The government has implemented several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a new **National Development Plan** that prioritizes investments in energy, transportation, and water and sanitation. The plan aims to increase access to electricity, improve road conditions, and expand access to clean water and sanitation. However, the implementation of these initiatives has been slow, and the country still faces significant infrastructure challenges.

Despite these challenges, Sao Tome and Principe has made some progress in recent years, with improvements in electricity access and internet penetration. The country has also seen an increase in foreign investment, particularly in the energy and tourism sectors, which is expected to drive infrastructure development in the coming years.
