[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Sao Tome and Principe is a **mixed system**, combining both public and private facilities. Public healthcare is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated equipment, while private facilities offer better quality care but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those with the means often opt for private care. Having **health insurance** is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the high costs of private healthcare.

The healthcare system in Sao Tome and Principe is also **fragmented**, with different facilities and providers offering varying levels of care. In general, public facilities are overcrowded and understaffed, while private facilities are better equipped but often have limited capacity. For foreigners, it is essential to research and identify reputable private facilities and providers before seeking care. Additionally, **language barriers** can be a significant issue, as Portuguese is the primary language spoken in Sao Tome and Principe, and not all healthcare providers speak English.
