The inflation rate of 14.3% in 2024 has also contributed to the rising cost of living. Despite this, eating out is a common practice, especially in the capital city of Sao Tome, where restaurants serve a mix of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also popular, with many residents opting to prepare their own meals using fresh ingredients from local markets. The eating-out culture is more prevalent among tourists and expats, while locals tend to prefer home-cooked meals or street food.\n\nThe cost of food in Sao Tome and Principe can vary depending on the location, with prices tend to be higher in the capital city than in rural areas. The country's GDP per capita PPP of $6,242 in 2024 indicates a relatively high standard of living, but the high inflation rate and limited access to certain products can make it challenging for residents to afford basic necessities. As a result, many people rely on traditional staples like **rice**, **beans**, and **fish**, which are relatively affordable and nutritious.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 45 STN | Imported from Portugal |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 22 STN | Local bakery |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.80 | 33 STN | Local farm |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50 | 28 STN | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $4.50 | 83 STN | Local farm |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 112 STN | Imported from Brazil |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.50 | 65 STN | Imported from South Africa |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 19 STN | Local farm |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.20 | 22 STN | Local farm |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 15 STN | Local farm |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00 | 93 STN | Local dairy |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 19 STN | Local brand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 | Typical dishes like calulu or arroz de pescado |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-15 | One person, local cuisine |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-30 | 3 courses, international cuisine |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-70 | Upscale, seafood or steak |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-3 | Local brew |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-5 | International brands |\n| Cappuccino | $2-3 | Coffee shop |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | Local brand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nSupermarkets in Sao Tome and Principe tend to be more expensive than local markets, with prices ranging from 10-20% higher for the same items.

It's recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported items.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for fresh produce. Vendors may initially quote a higher price, but it's expected that customers will negotiate. In supermarkets, prices are generally fixed, but it's still possible to find discounts or promotions. It's also worth noting that local markets often have a more lively atmosphere, with vendors calling out to customers and offering samples of their products.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Sao Tome and Principe is to opt for **street food** or **local eateries**, which offer traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- **Rice** and **beans** are staples in the local cuisine and are relatively affordable, making them a good option for budget-conscious travelers.\n- **Fresh fish** is also a good value, especially when purchased directly from fishermen or at local markets.\n- It's best to avoid buying **imported goods**, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local products.\n- **Local cheese** and **dairy products** are a good option, as they are relatively affordable and of high quality.\n- When shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to **bring cash** and be prepared to **haggle** over prices.",
