  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nSao Tome and Principe is an archipelago located in the Gulf of Guinea, off the coast of Central Africa. The islands were uninhabited until the arrival of the Portuguese in the late 15th century. In 1470, the Portuguese established a settlement on the island of Sao Tome, and in 1485, they founded a settlement on the island of Principe. The islands were officially declared a Portuguese colony in 1522. The Portuguese established a plantation economy, which relied heavily on slave labor, and the islands became a major producer of sugar, coffee, and cocoa.\n\nThe economy of Sao Tome and Principe was heavily reliant on the slave trade, which was abolished in 1876. After the abolition of slavery, the Portuguese brought in contract workers from other parts of Africa, as well as from Asia, to work on the plantations. This led to the creation of a unique cultural identity in Sao Tome and Principe, with influences from Africa, Europe, and Asia. In the 20th century, a nationalist movement emerged, seeking independence from Portugal. Sao Tome and Principe gained its independence on July 12, 1975, after a long struggle.\n\nSince independence, Sao Tome and Principe has been a **sovereign state**, with a democratic government and a mixed economy.
