The airport is served by airlines such as TAP Air Portugal, Lufthansa, and Air France, with direct flights from Lisbon, Frankfurt, and Paris. If you are traveling from neighboring countries, you can also enter Sao Tome and Principe by sea, with ferry services available from Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. However, these services are not frequent and may not be reliable.\n\nThe country's remote location and limited transportation network make it challenging to get to, but the scenic beauty and unique culture of the islands make it a worthwhile destination for adventurous travelers. Overland entry points are not available, as Sao Tome and Principe is an island nation. The main port of entry is the capital city of Sao Tome, where you can find a range of accommodation options and transportation services. From the airport or port, you can take a taxi or bus to your destination, or rent a car to explore the islands.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in Sao Tome and Principe is limited, with only a few flights per week between the two main islands, Sao Tome and Principe.

You can book domestic flights in advance through the airline's website or at the airport. The cost of a one-way ticket is around $100-$150, depending on the season and availability. It is recommended to book early, as flights can be irregular and may be canceled due to weather conditions or other factors.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in Sao Tome and Principe, so trains are not an option for getting around the islands.
