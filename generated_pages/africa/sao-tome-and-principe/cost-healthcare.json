  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Sao Tome and Principe varies significantly between public and private facilities, with the **health expenditure per capita** being $171, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 16.7% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $171\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 16.7%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: STN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Sao Tome and Principe is a **mixed system**, combining both public and private facilities. Public healthcare is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated equipment, while private facilities offer better quality care but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those with the means often opt for private care. Having **health insurance** is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the high costs of private healthcare.\n\nThe healthcare system in Sao Tome and Principe is also **fragmented**, with different facilities and providers offering varying levels of care. In general, public facilities are overcrowded and understaffed, while private facilities are better equipped but often have limited capacity. For foreigners, it is essential to research and identify reputable private facilities and providers before seeking care. Additionally, **language barriers** can be a significant issue, as Portuguese is the primary language spoken in Sao Tome and Principe, and not all healthcare providers speak English.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Limited specialist availability in public facilities |\n| Dental Checkup | $15-$30 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics offer better quality care |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$25 | $30-$50 | Limited eye care services available in public facilities |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private labs offer faster and more reliable results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public facilities often have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$200 | Private facilities offer better quality care and amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private facilities offer better quality maternity care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Limited availability in public facilities |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | Private facilities offer faster and more reliable results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public facility care, basic procedures, and medications |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Private facility care, specialist consultations, and advanced procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are often available at public pharmacies, but the selection is limited, and prices are generally higher than in private pharmacies.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available in private pharmacies, but prices can vary significantly depending on the brand and quality.\n- **Common medications** such as pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$20 in public pharmacies and $10-$50 in private pharmacies.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally limited outside of major cities, and **medication shortages** can occur, especially for specialized or imported medications.\n- **Prescription rules** are often not strictly enforced, and some medications can be obtained without a prescription, but this is not recommended.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a **medical emergency**, it is essential to call the emergency number 112 or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.

For foreigners, it is recommended to research and identify reputable private hospitals and emergency services before an emergency occurs. The **best hospitals for foreigners** are often private facilities with English-speaking staff and modern equipment, but these can be expensive and may require upfront payment or insurance coverage. In the event of a severe emergency, **evacuation to a neighboring country** or a more developed medical facility may be necessary, which can be costly and logistically challenging.",
