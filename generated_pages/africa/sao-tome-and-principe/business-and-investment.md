The business environment in Sao Tome and Principe is characterized by a relatively stable government, but with a high level of bureaucracy and corruption. The government has implemented policies to attract foreign investment, such as the creation of special economic zones and investment promotion agencies. However, the country still faces challenges such as limited infrastructure, lack of skilled labor, and a small domestic market. The government's attitude towards foreign investment is generally positive, but the process of starting and operating a business can be complex and time-consuming.

The country's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, with a focus on cocoa, coffee, and coconut production. The government has also been investing in the development of the tourism sector, with a focus on eco-tourism and sustainable tourism practices.
