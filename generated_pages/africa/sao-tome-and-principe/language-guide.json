  "content": "The official language of Sao Tome and Principe is **Portuguese**, which is widely spoken throughout the country, and visitors will find that speaking some basic Portuguese phrases can greatly enhance their experience.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Portuguese\nWidely Spoken: Forro, Angolar, and Principense\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Sao Tome and Principe is characterized by the dominance of Portuguese, which is the language used in government, education, and media. However, there are also several local dialects and languages spoken on the islands, including Forro, Angolar, and Principense. Forro is the most widely spoken creole language and is used as a lingua franca among the population. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of the capital city of Sao Tome, and visitors may find that not many locals speak English fluently. As a result, it is essential for visitors to learn some basic Portuguese phrases to communicate effectively during their stay.\n\nRegional dialects and minority languages are also an integral part of the country's linguistic heritage. Angolar, for example, is spoken by the Angolar people, who are descended from African slaves who escaped from plantations and established their own communities in the interior of the island. Principense, on the other hand, is spoken by the people of Principe Island and is a unique blend of Portuguese and African languages. Understanding and respecting these local languages and dialects can help visitors to better appreciate the cultural diversity of Sao Tome and Principe.\n\nDespite the limited English proficiency, many Sao Tomeans are eager to communicate with visitors and are patient with those who make an effort to speak Portuguese. Visitors can also find English-speaking guides and tour operators who can facilitate communication and provide valuable insights into the country's culture and history.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Olá | oh-LAH | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Oi | OH-ee | informal |\n| Thank you | Obrigado/Obrigada | oh-bree-GAH-doo/oh-bree-GAH-dah | male/female speaker |\n| Please | Por favor | pohr fah-VOHR |  |\n| Yes / No | Sim/Não | SEEM/NAH-oh |  |\n| Excuse me | Com licença | kohm lee-SEHN-sah |  |\n| How much? | Quanto custa? | KWAHN-toh KOOS-tah |  |\n| Where is...? | Onde está...? | OHN-deh EH-stah |  |\n| I don't understand | Não entendo | NAH-oh ehn-TEHN-doo |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Você fala inglês? | voh-CHEH fah-LAH eeng-lee-EHZ |  |\n| Help! | Socorro! | soo-KOH-roo |  |\n| Goodbye | Tchau | CHOW | informal |\n| Sorry | Desculpe | deh-SKOOL-peh |  |\n| How are you? | Como está? | KOH-moh EH-stah |  |\n| What's your name? | Qual é o seu nome? | KWAH ehl oh SEH-oo NOH-meh |  |\n| My name is... | Eu me chamo... | YOO meh SHAH-moo |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Um | oon |\n| 2 | Dois | DOH-ees |\n| 3 | Três | TRAY-s |\n| 4 | Quatro | KWAH-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | SIHN-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | SAY-s |\n| 7 | Sete | SEH-teh |\n| 8 | Oito | OH-ee-toh |\n| 9 | Nove | noo-VAY |\n| 10 | Dez | DEH-z |\n| 100 | Cem | SEHM |\n| 1000 | Mil | MEEL |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, and try to learn a few basic Portuguese phrases to show your appreciation for the culture.\n- Use formal titles such as **Senhor** or **Senhora** when addressing older people or those in positions of authority.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered impolite, such as pointing with the index finger or using the left hand to give or receive something.\n- Smile and make an effort to communicate, even if you don't speak the language fluently.\n- Learn to recognize and respond to basic Portuguese phrases, such as **sim** (yes) and **não** (no).\n- Be patient and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n- Respect people's personal space and avoid touching or standing too close to others.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app such as Google Translate or iTranslate to help you communicate with locals.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help you learn basic Portuguese phrases.\n- Look for English-speaking guides or tour operators who can provide valuable insights into the country's culture and history.\n- Take a Portuguese language course or use online resources to learn the basics before your trip.\n- Don't be afraid to ask locals for help or directions, and be prepared to use hand gestures or simple drawings to communicate if necessary.",
