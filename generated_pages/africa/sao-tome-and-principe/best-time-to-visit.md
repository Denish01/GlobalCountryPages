[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Sao Tome and Principe is a tropical archipelago located in the Gulf of Guinea, with a climate characterized by high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The country has two main climate zones: the coastal areas, which are generally hotter and more humid, and the interior, which is cooler and more mountainous. The dry season, from June to September, is the best time to visit, with average temperatures ranging from 22 to 28 degrees Celsius. During this period, the weather is dry and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, birdwatching, and snorkeling. The wet season, from October to May, is characterized by heavy rainfall and potential hurricanes, making it less suitable for travel.

The seasons in Sao Tome and Principe have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, prices for accommodations and tours are higher, and popular destinations such as the capital city of Sao Tome and the island of Principe can get crowded. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices, but some tourist facilities and attractions may be closed due to the weather conditions.

Overall, the best time to visit Sao Tome and Principe depends on your preferences and what you want to do. If you prefer dry and sunny weather, the dry season is the best time to visit. If you are on a budget and don't mind the rain, the wet season may be a good option.
