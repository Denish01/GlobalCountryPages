Typical lease terms are one to two years, and deposit requirements can range from one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract and to understand the terms and conditions before signing. Compared to regional neighbors like Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe's housing costs are relatively moderate. However, the country's remote location and limited infrastructure can make it challenging to find affordable and quality housing, especially for expats.\n\nThe housing market in Sao Tome and Principe is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including a high inflation rate of 14.3% and a relatively low GDP per capita. As a result, the demand for housing is largely driven by the local population, with a limited number of expats and foreigners living in the country. Despite these challenges, Sao Tome and Principe's housing market offers a unique opportunity for those looking to experience a tranquil and picturesque island lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$300 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$600 | $250-$400 | Standard quality, private bathroom and kitchen |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $400-$600 | Family size, modern amenities, private balcony |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,200 | $600-$900 | Spacious, high-end finishes, private garden |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, ocean views, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | Residential areas, quiet neighborhoods, easy access to city center |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | Rural areas, limited amenities, stunning natural scenery |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Sao Tome City**: The capital city offers a range of accommodation options, from modern apartments to colonial-style houses, with rent ranges from $400 to $1,000 per month.\n- **Santo Antonio**: A charming neighborhood in the city center, known for its historic architecture, lively markets, and affordable rent options from $300 to $600 per month.\n- **Neves**: A coastal town located about 20 km from the capital, offering a more relaxed atmosphere, stunning ocean views, and rent ranges from $250 to $500 per month.\n- **Trindade**: A suburban area with a mix of modern and traditional housing, easy access to the city center, and rent options from $200 to $400 per month.\n- **Santana**: A rural town located in the north of the island, offering a peaceful and natural environment, limited amenities, and rent ranges from $150 to $300 per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Sao Tome and Principe [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and understand the prices and conditions before starting your housing search.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable accommodation.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, as this is a common practice in Sao Tome and Principe.\n- Ensure that the property is well-maintained and has all the necessary amenities, such as electricity, water, and internet.\n- Be aware of potential scams and always inspect the property before signing a lease or making a payment.\n- Consider the location and proximity to essential services, such as schools, hospitals, and markets, when choosing a neighborhood.",
