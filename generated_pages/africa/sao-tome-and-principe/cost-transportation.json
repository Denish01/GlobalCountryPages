The quality of public transit is relatively good, with buses and minibuses covering most areas of the islands. However, the roads can be narrow and winding, and traffic congestion is common, especially in the capital city of Sao Tome.\n\nThe lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on taxis and private cars to get around. The government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of new bus services. Despite these efforts, transportation costs can be relatively high, especially for those who rely on taxis and private cars.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-$2 | $20-$30 | Good coverage of city areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Covers most areas of the islands |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $1-$2 | $10-$20 | Available in city areas |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$100 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | Limited schedules and routes |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Between Sao Tome and Principe islands |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using buses and minibuses instead of taxis.\n- Negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before starting your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or for exploring the islands, but be aware of the limited parking options.\n- Use reputable taxi services, especially at night, and always check the driver's ID before getting in the car.\n- Download maps or transportation apps to help navigate the islands and plan your route in advance.",
