[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Sao Tome and Principe is characterized by the dominance of Portuguese, which is the language used in government, education, and media. However, there are also several local dialects and languages spoken on the islands, including Forro, Angolar, and Principense. Forro is the most widely spoken creole language and is used as a lingua franca among the population. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of the capital city of Sao Tome, and visitors may find that not many locals speak English fluently. As a result, it is essential for visitors to learn some basic Portuguese phrases to communicate effectively during their stay.

Regional dialects and minority languages are also an integral part of the country's linguistic heritage. Angolar, for example, is spoken by the Angolar people, who are descended from African slaves who escaped from plantations and established their own communities in the interior of the island. Principense, on the other hand, is spoken by the people of Principe Island and is a unique blend of Portuguese and African languages. Understanding and respecting these local languages and dialects can help visitors to better appreciate the cultural diversity of Sao Tome and Principe.

Despite the limited English proficiency, many Sao Tomeans are eager to communicate with visitors and are patient with those who make an effort to speak Portuguese. Visitors can also find English-speaking guides and tour operators who can facilitate communication and provide valuable insights into the country's culture and history.
