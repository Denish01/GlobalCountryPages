[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Sao Tome and Principe are driven up by the country's remote location and reliance on imports, which can make everyday items expensive. The inflation rate of 14.3% in 2024 has also contributed to the rising cost of living. Despite this, eating out is a common practice, especially in the capital city of Sao Tome, where restaurants serve a mix of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also popular, with many residents opting to prepare their own meals using fresh ingredients from local markets. The eating-out culture is more prevalent among tourists and expats, while locals tend to prefer home-cooked meals or street food.

The cost of food in Sao Tome and Principe can vary depending on the location, with prices tend to be higher in the capital city than in rural areas. The country's GDP per capita PPP of $6,242 in 2024 indicates a relatively high standard of living, but the high inflation rate and limited access to certain products can make it challenging for residents to afford basic necessities. As a result, many people rely on traditional staples like **rice**, **beans**, and **fish**, which are relatively affordable and nutritious.
