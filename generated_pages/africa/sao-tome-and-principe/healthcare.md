[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Sao Tome and Principe is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, and it provides a range of services, including **primary care**, **specialized care**, and **public health programs**. However, the system faces significant challenges, including a shortage of **medical professionals**, limited **infrastructure**, and inadequate **equipment**. In urban areas, such as the capital Sao Tome, there are more healthcare facilities and services available, but in rural areas, access to care can be limited, and the quality of care can be poor.

The public healthcare system is generally underfunded, and services can be slow and inefficient. In contrast, private healthcare facilities, such as clinics and hospitals, offer better quality care, but they can be expensive, and not all services are available. **Expats** and **foreigners** often prefer to use private facilities, but they may need to pay out-of-pocket or have **international health insurance** to cover the costs.

Despite the challenges, the government of Sao Tome and Principe has been working to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new **hospitals** and **health centers**, and training more **medical professionals**. However, more needs to be done to address the significant health disparities and improve access to quality care for all citizens.
