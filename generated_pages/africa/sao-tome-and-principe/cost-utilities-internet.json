As a result, costs can fluctuate, and residents often rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators. The country's high inflation rate of 14.3% also contributes to the instability of utility prices. Seasonal variation plays a role, with higher electricity costs during the dry season due to increased demand for air conditioning and lower water costs during the rainy season.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Sao Tome and Principe is affected by the country's limited resources and infrastructure. The government has been working to improve the utility sector, but challenges persist. Residents often experience interruptions in service, particularly during peak hours. Despite these challenges, the cost of utilities in Sao Tome and Principe is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. However, the high inflation rate and limited availability of certain services, such as gas and heating, can make it difficult for residents to budget for their utility costs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | limited availability |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in water bill |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$140** | **$200** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | CST, Unitel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 100 Mbps | CST, Unitel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | CST, Unitel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | CST, Unitel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-80 | varies | CST, Unitel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in Portuguese |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Portuguese |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents typically need to visit the provider's office in person and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans are more common and often offer better rates.\n- CST and Unitel are the primary internet and phone providers in Sao Tome and Principe, offering a range of plans and services.\n- Residents can save on their utility bills by using energy-efficient appliances and conserving water.\n- It is recommended to negotiate with providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
