[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The main transportation modes in Sao Tome and Principe include taxis, buses, and minibuses, with most people relying on these services to get around. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with buses and minibuses covering most areas of the islands. However, the roads can be narrow and winding, and traffic congestion is common, especially in the capital city of Sao Tome.

The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on taxis and private cars to get around. The government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of new bus services. Despite these efforts, transportation costs can be relatively high, especially for those who rely on taxis and private cars.
