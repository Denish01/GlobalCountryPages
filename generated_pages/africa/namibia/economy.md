[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Namibia's economy is classified as an upper-middle-income economy, with a relatively high GDP per capita compared to other countries in the region. The country has a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. Namibia has made significant progress in recent years in terms of economic development, with a stable and growing economy. The country's economic trajectory is largely driven by its natural resources, including minerals, fisheries, and tourism. However, the economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and droughts that affect the agricultural sector.

Namibia's economic development level is relatively high compared to other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The country has a well-developed infrastructure, including a good road network, a modern telecommunications system, and a number of ports and airports. The government has also implemented policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, including investments in education and healthcare. However, despite these efforts, Namibia still faces significant development challenges, including high levels of income inequality and unemployment.

The country's economy is also closely tied to that of its neighbors, particularly South Africa, with which it shares a common currency and customs union. This has helped to promote trade and investment between the two countries, but it also makes Namibia vulnerable to economic shocks in South Africa. Overall, Namibia's economy is well-positioned for growth, but it will need to continue to diversify and develop its economy in order to reduce its dependence on a few key sectors and to promote more inclusive and sustainable growth.
