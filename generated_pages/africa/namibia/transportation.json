The airport receives direct flights from several major hubs, including Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Frankfurt. You can also enter Namibia overland from neighboring countries, including Angola, Zambia, Botswana, and South Africa, via several border posts. The most popular overland entry points are the B1 highway from South Africa and the Trans-Kalahari Highway from Botswana.\n\nIf you're planning to enter Namibia by land, it's essential to research the necessary documentation and regulations in advance. You'll need a valid passport, visa (if required), and car insurance, as well as a valid driver's license if you're driving. Additionally, some border posts may have specific requirements, such as a police clearance certificate or a certified copy of your vehicle's registration.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nNamibia's domestic air network is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between major towns. Air Namibia is the national carrier, offering flights from Windhoek to several domestic destinations, including Swakopmund, Walvis Bay, and Katima Mulilo. You can book flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way ticket from Windhoek to Swakopmund can cost around $200-$300.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nNamibia's rail network is limited, with only a few passenger trains operating between major towns.
