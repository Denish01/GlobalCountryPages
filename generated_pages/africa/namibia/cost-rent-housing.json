Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under Namibian law, with provisions for fair rent, maintenance, and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Namibia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in South Africa but higher than in some of the other Southern African countries. The country's housing market is also influenced by its growing economy and increasing demand for housing, particularly in the capital city of Windhoek.\n\nThe housing market in Namibia is characterized by a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in the lower-income segment. This has led to an increase in informal settlements and backyard shacks, particularly in urban areas. However, the government has implemented initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the development of affordable housing projects and subsidies for low-income households. Despite these challenges, Namibia's housing market remains relatively stable, with a wide range of accommodation options available to suit different budgets and preferences.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | standard, furnished or unfurnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,200 | $400-$800 | spacious, family-friendly |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,000-$2,000 | $600-$1,200 | large, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,800 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | rural areas, farmhouses or smallholdings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Klein Windhoek**: a safe and prestigious neighborhood with modern amenities, rent range $500-$1,500 USD per month\n- **Luxury Hill**: an upmarket neighborhood with stunning views, rent range $800-$2,500 USD per month\n- **Eros**: a family-friendly neighborhood with good schools and amenities, rent range $400-$1,200 USD per month\n- **Auasblick**: a convenient and affordable neighborhood, rent range $250-$800 USD per month\n- **Olympia**: a popular neighborhood with a range of amenities, rent range $300-$1,000 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Namibia [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and accommodation options thoroughly before making a decision\n- Work with a reputable estate agent or property manager to find a suitable property\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease agreement\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease agreement if possible\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that the property is legally owned by the landlord\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, and tenants are responsible for paying these separately\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Namibia, and tenants may need to provide their own furniture and appliances\n- [CALLOUT] Be sure to read and understand the terms of the lease agreement before signing, and seek legal advice if necessary.",
