As a result, prices can fluctuate depending on factors such as transportation costs, exchange rates, and regional supply and demand. The country's eating-out culture is relatively developed, with a range of restaurants and cafes available, particularly in urban areas like Windhoek. However, home cooking remains a staple, with many locals opting to prepare traditional dishes such as **braai** (barbecued meat) and **potjiekos** (stew) using locally sourced ingredients.\n\nCompared to other countries in the region, Namibia's food prices are relatively high, which can be attributed to the country's high standard of living and relatively strong economy. The inflation rate of 4.2% in 2024 also contributes to the increasing food prices. However, the country's **GDP per capita PPP** of $11,687 in 2024 indicates a relatively high level of purchasing power, which can help to offset the high food prices. Additionally, the **health expenditure per capita** of $397 in 2023 and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 7.5% in 2023 suggest that Namibians have a significant amount of disposable income to spend on food and other necessities.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50-$2.50 | 20-35 NAD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20-$2.00 | 15-25 NAD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00-$3.00 | 25-40 NAD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 20-35 NAD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00-$8.00 | 80-110 NAD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00-$15.00 | 140-200 NAD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00-$5.00 | 40-70 NAD | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00-$3.50 | 25-45 NAD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 20-35 NAD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 15-25 NAD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00-$12.00 | 110-160 NAD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00-$2.00 | 15-25 NAD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (traditional dishes like **sosaties** and **boerewors**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-$50 | (3 courses, **wine** and **beer** available) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $60-$100 | (upscale, **international cuisine**) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$6 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Namibians have the option to choose between supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets tend to have a wider range of products, including **imported goods**, but prices can be higher. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices. However, the quality and variety of products can vary. In general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods and **household essentials**.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with prices at local markets often being 20-50% lower. However, the quality and freshness of products can vary, and bargaining is often expected at local markets. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to **haggle** and negotiate prices, as vendors often quote higher prices for tourists. In contrast, supermarkets have fixed prices, and bargaining is not expected.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries and street food stalls is a great way to experience traditional Namibian cuisine at affordable prices.\n- **Braai** (barbecued meat) is a staple in Namibian cuisine, and buying meat in bulk can be a cost-effective option.\n- **Potjiekos** (stew) is another traditional dish that can be made with affordable ingredients like **beans**, **lentils**, and **vegetables**.\n- Buying fresh produce at local markets can be a great way to save money and support local farmers.\n- Avoid buying **imported goods**, as they can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local products.\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink, and buying bottled water can be expensive, so it's recommended to stick to tap water or **filtered water**.",
