[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Namibia has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with a range of options available for getting around the country. The main modes of transportation are **private cars**, **taxis**, and **minibuses**, with **buses** and **trains** also available for longer journeys. The quality of public transit in Namibia is generally good, with regular services and relatively affordable fares. However, the availability and frequency of public transportation can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas such as Windhoek and Swakopmund having more comprehensive networks than rural areas.

Most people in Namibia get around using **private cars**, which are widely available for rent or purchase. However, for those without access to a private vehicle, **taxis** and **minibuses** are a common and affordable option. **Buses** are also a popular mode of transportation, particularly for longer journeys between cities. The **train network** in Namibia is limited, but it can be a scenic and affordable way to travel, particularly for tourists.
