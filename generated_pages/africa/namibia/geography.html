        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Namibia is a sovereign country located in southern Africa, bordered by several countries, including Angola to the north, Zambia and Botswana to the northeast, and South Africa to the south and east. The country has a long coastline along the Atlantic Ocean to the west, which provides a unique blend of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Namibia's strategic location allows it to serve as a gateway between the southern African region and the rest of the world. The country's borders are well-defined, with a total length of approximately 3,880 kilometers.</p>
        <p>The country's location in the southern hemisphere means that its seasons are reversed compared to those in the northern hemisphere. Namibia's terrain is also characterized by a unique combination of <strong>deserts</strong>, <strong>mountains</strong>, and <strong>coastal plains</strong>, making it a fascinating destination for tourists and adventure seekers. The country's borders with its neighboring countries are relatively peaceful, with several border crossings that facilitate the movement of people and goods. The capital city, Windhoek, is located in the central part of the country, and it serves as the main hub for commerce, tourism, and governance.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Namibia's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including <strong>deserts</strong>, <strong>mountains</strong>, <strong>rivers</strong>, and <strong>coastal plains</strong>. The Namib Desert, which covers much of the western part of the country, is one of the oldest and most extreme deserts in the world. The desert is known for its unique <strong>fog ecosystem</strong>, which supports a wide range of plant and animal species that are adapted to the harsh conditions. The <strong>Skeleton Coast</strong>, which runs along the northern part of the coastline, is a narrow strip of land that is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Namib Desert to the east.</p>
        <p>The central part of Namibia is dominated by a <strong>high plateau</strong>, which is characterized by <strong>granite mountains</strong> and <strong>inselbergs</strong> (isolated rock formations). The <strong>Brandberg Mountain</strong>, which is the highest point in Namibia, is located in this region. The <strong>Fish River Canyon</strong>, which is one of the largest canyons in the world, is also located in southern Namibia. The canyon is a popular destination for hiking and trekking, and it offers breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. The <strong>Orange River</strong>, which forms the border with South Africa, is the longest river in Namibia and it supports a wide range of aquatic life.</p>
        <p>The <strong>coastal plains</strong>, which run along the Atlantic coastline, are characterized by <strong>sand dunes</strong>, <strong>salt pans</strong>, and <strong>lagoons</strong>. The <strong>Etosha Pan</strong>, which is a large salt pan located in northern Namibia, is a popular destination for wildlife viewing, particularly during the dry season when animals congregate around the waterholes. The <strong>Kaokoland</strong> region, which is located in northwestern Namibia, is a remote and rugged area that is characterized by <strong>mountains</strong>, <strong>rivers</strong>, and <strong>deserts</strong>. The region is home to a wide range of unique plant and animal species, including the <strong>Himba people</strong>, who are known for their traditional lifestyle and cultural practices.</p>
