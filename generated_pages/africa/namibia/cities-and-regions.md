[SECTION] How Namibia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Namibia is divided into 14 regions, each with its own regional council and administration. These regions are further divided into 121 constituencies, which are the smallest administrative units in the country. The regional councils are responsible for providing basic services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure to the local population. The 14 regions of Namibia are: Kunene, Omusati, Oshana, Ohangwena, Oshikoto, Kavango East, Kavango West, Khomas, Erongo, Otjozondjupa, Omaheke, Hardap, Karas, and Zambezi.

The administrative structure of Namibia is designed to promote decentralization and community participation in governance. Each region has its own unique characteristics, cultural heritage, and economic activities, which are reflected in the regional councils' development plans and priorities. The regional councils work closely with the central government to ensure that national policies and programs are implemented effectively at the local level.
