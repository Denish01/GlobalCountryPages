The main modes of transportation are **private cars**, **taxis**, and **minibuses**, with **buses** and **trains** also available for longer journeys. The quality of public transit in Namibia is generally good, with regular services and relatively affordable fares. However, the availability and frequency of public transportation can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas such as Windhoek and Swakopmund having more comprehensive networks than rural areas.\n\nMost people in Namibia get around using **private cars**, which are widely available for rent or purchase. However, for those without access to a private vehicle, **taxis** and **minibuses** are a common and affordable option. **Buses** are also a popular mode of transportation, particularly for longer journeys between cities. The **train network** in Namibia is limited, but it can be a scenic and affordable way to travel, particularly for tourists.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-$2 | $20-$30 | Good coverage in urban areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Namibia |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Frequent services on main routes |\n| Commuter Train | $5-$10 | $50-$100 | Limited network, mostly used for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $1.50 | $10-$20 | Widely available in urban areas |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $4 | $1.20 | $8-$15 | Bolt and Uber available in main cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in urban areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads in Namibia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Frequent services on main routes |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$300 | Limited routes, mostly used for tourist destinations |\n| Train (long-distance) | $50-$100 | Limited network, mostly used for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are often cheaper than **taxis** or **ride-hailing apps**.\n- Use **Bolt** or **Uber** for **ride-hailing**, which are widely available in main cities.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a **taxi** or **minibus**.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, particularly in crowded **minibus** or **taxi** situations.\n- Consider **renting a car** for longer journeys or to explore rural areas, as **public transportation** can be limited.\n- Use a **reputable taxi company** or **ride-hailing app** to ensure a safe and reliable journey, particularly at night or in unfamiliar areas.",
