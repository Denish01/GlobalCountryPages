The public healthcare system is generally overcrowded and understaffed, but it provides affordable healthcare services to the majority of the population. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers better quality care, but it is more expensive and often out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to access quality healthcare services. The public healthcare system is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost healthcare services to citizens, while the private healthcare system is funded by private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments.\n\nThe healthcare system in Namibia is designed to provide universal access to healthcare services, but the quality of care varies significantly between public and private healthcare providers. Public healthcare services are often overcrowded and understaffed, which can lead to long waiting times and poor quality care. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, offer better quality care, but they are often expensive and out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to access quality healthcare services. Many private health insurance providers offer a range of coverage options, including basic local insurance, comprehensive private insurance, and international or expat insurance.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $15-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by dentist and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$25 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by optometrist and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by laboratory and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by procedure and location |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,500 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers a wide range of medical expenses, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical expenses worldwide, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as painkillers and antibiotics are widely available at pharmacies and are relatively affordable, with prices ranging from $5 to $20.\n- Prescription medications are available at pharmacies, but they often require a prescription from a doctor.\n- Pharmacy availability varies by location, with more pharmacies available in urban areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets.\n- Prices for medications vary by brand and location, with generic medications often being cheaper than brand-name medications.\n- Some medications may not be available in Namibia, so it is recommended to bring a supply of essential medications when traveling to the country.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112 or 10111 for assistance.
