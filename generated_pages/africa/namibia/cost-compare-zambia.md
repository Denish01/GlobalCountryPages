[SECTION] Overview: Namibia vs Zambia [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Namibia and Zambia varies significantly, with Namibia being one of the more expensive countries in Southern Africa. This is largely due to Namibia's strong economy, driven by its mining and tourism industries, which has led to a higher standard of living and consequently higher prices. In contrast, Zambia's economy is more agriculture-based, and the country has faced economic challenges in recent years, resulting in a lower cost of living. Overall, Zambia is around 20-30% cheaper than Namibia, making it a more attractive option for those on a tight budget.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Namibia has a more developed infrastructure and a stronger currency, which makes imports more expensive. Zambia, on the other hand, has a less developed infrastructure and a weaker currency, which makes imports cheaper. This is reflected in the prices of goods and services, with Zambia generally offering better value for money. However, it's worth noting that Namibia's higher prices are also reflected in its higher standard of living, with better healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
