[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Namibia is generally a safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other countries in the region. The country has a strong tourism infrastructure and a well-organized police force, which contributes to the safety of visitors. However, as with any travel destination, it's essential to take common-sense precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip. Petty crimes such as pickpocketing and theft can occur, especially in crowded areas and tourist hotspots. Additionally, scams targeting tourists are not uncommon, so it's crucial to be aware of your surroundings and cautious when dealing with strangers.

Namibia's vast and sparsely populated landscape can also pose some unique safety challenges, particularly when it comes to driving and outdoor activities. The country's roads can be rough, and driving at night is not recommended due to the presence of wildlife and poor road conditions. Furthermore, Namibia's diverse climate and geography can pose health risks, such as heat exhaustion and malaria, so it's essential to take necessary precautions and seek medical attention if needed. Overall, with some basic precautions and an understanding of the local environment, visitors can have a safe and enjoyable experience in Namibia.
