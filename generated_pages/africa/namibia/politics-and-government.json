The **executive branch**, headed by the President, is responsible for the administration of the country, while the **legislative branch**, composed of the National Assembly and the National Council, is responsible for making laws. The **judicial branch**, composed of the Supreme Court and the High Court, is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring that they are in line with the constitution. Namibia's system of government is designed to provide checks and balances between the different branches, preventing any one branch from dominating the others.\n\nThe government of Namibia is also **unitary**, meaning that power is concentrated in the central government, rather than being divided between the central government and regional governments. This means that the central government has significant control over the country's affairs, although there are also **regional councils** that have some degree of autonomy.\n\nNamibia's **constitution**, which was adopted in 1990, provides the framework for the country's system of government. It establishes the principles of **democracy**, **human rights**, and the **rule of law**, and provides for the protection of individual rights and freedoms. The constitution also provides for the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers between the different branches of government.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President Hage Geingob | Head of state and government, commander-in-chief of the armed forces |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker of the National Assembly | Makes laws, approves the budget, and exercises oversight over the executive branch |\n| Legislative | National Council | Chairperson of the National Council | Provides representation for regional interests, reviews legislation, and advises the National Assembly |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice | Highest court in the land, interprets laws and ensures that they are in line with the constitution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SWAPO Party | Center-left | Hage Geingob | 77 | Dominant party, has been in power since independence in 1990 |\n| Popular Democratic Movement | Center-right | McHenry Venaani | 16 | Main opposition party, advocates for **free market** policies and **democratic reforms** |\n| Landless People's Movement | Left-wing | Bernadus Swartbooi | 4 | Advocates for **land reform** and **social justice** |\n| National Unity Democratic Organisation | Center | Asser Kuveri Kapere | 2 | Advocates for **national unity** and **regional development** |\n| United Democratic Front | Center-left | Apius Auchab | 2 | Advocates for **social justice** and **human rights** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Namibia is based on **proportional representation**, with voters electing members to the National Assembly and the National Council.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent election taking place in 2019.\n- The next election is scheduled to take place in 2024.\n- Voter participation in Namibia is generally high, with turnout rates ranging from 70% to 80% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Namibia has a relatively stable political climate, with a strong tradition of **democratic governance** and **respect for human rights**.\n- However, the country faces several challenges, including **high levels of inequality** and **poverty**, particularly in rural areas.\n- The country is also vulnerable to **drought** and **climate change**, which can have significant impacts on the economy and food security.\n- Regional dynamics, particularly in the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)**, can also have an impact on Namibia's political stability.\n- The country has a **medium level of corruption**, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index, which can undermine trust in institutions and hinder development.\n- Freedom indices, such as the **Freedom in the World** report, generally rank Namibia as **free**, with a strong tradition of **democratic governance** and **respect for human rights**.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Namibia is a member of several international organizations, including the **United Nations (UN)**, the **African Union (AU)**, and the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)**.\n- The country has a **strong relationship** with its neighbors, particularly **South Africa**, with which it shares a long border and significant economic ties.\n- Namibia is also a member of the **Commonwealth of Nations**, and has a **special relationship** with the **European Union**, which provides significant development assistance to the country.\n- The country has a **neutral** diplomatic stance, and has sought to maintain good relations with a range of countries, including **China**, **Germany**, and the **United States**.\n- Namibia is also a member of the **Non-Aligned Movement**, and has sought to promote **South-South cooperation** and **regional integration**.",
