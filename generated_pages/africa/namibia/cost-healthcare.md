[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Namibia has a mixed healthcare system, which combines public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally overcrowded and understaffed, but it provides affordable healthcare services to the majority of the population. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers better quality care, but it is more expensive and often out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to access quality healthcare services. The public healthcare system is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost healthcare services to citizens, while the private healthcare system is funded by private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments.

The healthcare system in Namibia is designed to provide universal access to healthcare services, but the quality of care varies significantly between public and private healthcare providers. Public healthcare services are often overcrowded and understaffed, which can lead to long waiting times and poor quality care. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, offer better quality care, but they are often expensive and out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to access quality healthcare services. Many private health insurance providers offer a range of coverage options, including basic local insurance, comprehensive private insurance, and international or expat insurance.
