[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Namibia's rental market is relatively stable, with a mix of apartments, houses, and townhouses available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under Namibian law, with provisions for fair rent, maintenance, and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Namibia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in South Africa but higher than in some of the other Southern African countries. The country's housing market is also influenced by its growing economy and increasing demand for housing, particularly in the capital city of Windhoek.

The housing market in Namibia is characterized by a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in the lower-income segment. This has led to an increase in informal settlements and backyard shacks, particularly in urban areas. However, the government has implemented initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the development of affordable housing projects and subsidies for low-income households. Despite these challenges, Namibia's housing market remains relatively stable, with a wide range of accommodation options available to suit different budgets and preferences.
