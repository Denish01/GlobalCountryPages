# Namibia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Namibia's infrastructure is relatively well-developed compared to other countries in Africa, with a strong focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications, but still faces challenges in terms of rural access and reliability.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 62% of population
Internet Penetration: 34%
Road Network: 44,138 km, with 12,313 km paved
Rail Network: 2,687 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 1 major port, Walvis Bay
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Namibia's infrastructure development level is moderate, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's transportation network, energy sector, and telecommunications. The government has implemented various initiatives to address the urban-rural gap, including the development of rural roads and the expansion of electricity and water services to remote areas. However, despite these efforts, many rural communities still lack access to basic services, and the country's infrastructure remains largely underdeveloped compared to other parts of the world. The government has also launched several initiatives to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, including public-private partnerships and concessions.

The country's infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with the construction of new roads, bridges, and buildings. The government has also invested in the development of **renewable energy** sources, including **solar** and **wind power**, to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to improve the efficiency and reliability of the energy sector, including the introduction of **smart grids** and **energy storage systems**. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of energy access, particularly in rural areas where many households rely on **traditional biomass** for cooking and heating.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development remains a significant challenge in Namibia, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address this gap, including the development of rural infrastructure and the expansion of services to remote areas. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in infrastructure development between urban and rural areas. The government has also recognized the importance of **infrastructure development** in promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, and has made significant investments in this sector in recent years.
