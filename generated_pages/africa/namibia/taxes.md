[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Namibia has a **territorial taxation** system, where tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the taxpayer's residence. However, residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. The residency rules for tax purposes in Namibia are based on the **physical presence test**, where an individual is considered a resident if they are present in the country for more than 183 days in a 12-month period.

The tax system in Namibia is administered by the **Namibia Revenue Agency (NRA)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs duties, and other levies. The NRA also provides guidance and support to taxpayers, including expatriates and foreign workers. Namibia has a relatively complex tax system, with various taxes and levies applicable to different types of income and transactions. However, the country has implemented various measures to simplify the tax system and improve compliance, including the introduction of electronic filing and payment systems.
