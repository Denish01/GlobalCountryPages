[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Namibia is a multilingual country with a diverse range of languages spoken across the country. The most widely spoken languages are Oshiwambo, Afrikaans, and German, in addition to English, which is the official language. Oshiwambo is spoken by around 50% of the population, primarily in the north, while Afrikaans is widely spoken in the south. German is also spoken by a significant minority, particularly in the capital city of Windhoek. The country has a high level of English proficiency, making it relatively easy for tourists to communicate and navigate. However, learning a few basic phrases in the local languages can go a long way in showing respect and appreciation for the culture.

The linguistic landscape of Namibia is also characterized by regional dialects and minority languages. For example, the Herero language is spoken by the Herero people, who are primarily found in the central and eastern parts of the country. The Nama language is spoken by the Nama people, who are found in the southern parts of the country. These languages are an important part of Namibian culture and identity, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote them.

English is widely understood in Namibia, particularly in urban areas and among the business community. However, in rural areas, the level of English proficiency may be lower, and it is not uncommon for people to speak little or no English. In these situations, it can be helpful to learn a few basic phrases in the local languages or to carry a phrasebook or dictionary.

- Avoid using gestures that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the left hand or using the "thumbs up" sign.

- Learn a few basic phrases in the local languages, such as "hello" and "thank you," to show respect and appreciation for the culture.
