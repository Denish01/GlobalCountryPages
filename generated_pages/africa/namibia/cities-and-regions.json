These regions are further divided into 121 constituencies, which are the smallest administrative units in the country. The regional councils are responsible for providing basic services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure to the local population. The 14 regions of Namibia are: Kunene, Omusati, Oshana, Ohangwena, Oshikoto, Kavango East, Kavango West, Khomas, Erongo, Otjozondjupa, Omaheke, Hardap, Karas, and Zambezi.\n\nThe administrative structure of Namibia is designed to promote decentralization and community participation in governance.
