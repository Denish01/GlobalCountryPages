  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nNamibia, a country located in southern Africa, has a complex and multifaceted history. The earliest inhabitants of the region were the **San** and **Khoikhoi** peoples, who migrated to the area thousands of years ago. In the 19th century, European powers, including Germany, began to take an interest in the region, and in 1884, Germany declared South West Africa, as it was then known, a German protectorate. This marked the beginning of a period of colonization that would last for several decades. During this time, the German colonial administration imposed its own language, culture, and customs on the indigenous population, leading to significant social and economic changes.\n\nIn the early 20th century, following Germany's defeat in World War I, South West Africa was mandated to South Africa by the League of Nations. This led to a period of South African rule, which lasted until 1990. During this time, the country was subject to the policies of apartheid, which had a profound impact on the population. The **South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)**, a nationalist movement, was formed in the 1960s to fight for independence. After decades of struggle, Namibia finally gained its independence on March 21, 1990, with Sam Nujoma as its first president.\n\nThe country's early years of independence were marked by efforts to rebuild and develop the economy, as well as to address the social and economic inequalities that had been created during the period of colonization and apartheid. In 1994, Namibia held its first democratic elections, which were won by SWAPO. Since then, the country has continued to develop and grow, with a focus on promoting economic development, improving living standards, and protecting the environment.\n\nToday, Namibia is a **sovereign** country, with a population of approximately 2.6 million people. The capital city is **Windhoek**, and the official language is **English**, although many other languages, including **Oshiwambo** and **Afrikaans**, are also widely spoken.
