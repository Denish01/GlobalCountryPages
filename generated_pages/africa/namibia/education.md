[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Namibia is divided into three main categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. **Primary education** is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, and is provided free of charge by the government. The primary education system is based on the **Namibian Curriculum**, which emphasizes the development of essential skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics. After completing primary education, students proceed to **secondary education**, which is also compulsory and lasts for five years. Secondary education is divided into two phases: junior secondary and senior secondary. The junior secondary phase focuses on providing students with a broad-based education, while the senior secondary phase allows students to specialize in specific subjects.

The quality of education in Namibia is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on providing students with practical skills and knowledge. However, there are some challenges facing the education system, including a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate infrastructure in some schools. Despite these challenges, the Namibian government has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including introducing new curricula and investing in teacher training programs. The education system in Namibia is also characterized by a mix of public and private schools, with private schools generally offering higher quality education but at a higher cost.

In terms of access to education, Namibia has made significant progress in recent years, with a significant increase in the number of students enrolled in school. However, there are still some challenges facing the education system, including a shortage of schools in rural areas and a lack of resources in some schools. Despite these challenges, the Namibian government is committed to providing quality education to all its citizens, and has introduced a number of initiatives aimed at improving access to education, including the provision of free primary education and the introduction of a **National Student Financial Assistance Program**.
