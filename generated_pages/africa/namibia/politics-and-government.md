[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Namibia is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The **executive branch**, headed by the President, is responsible for the administration of the country, while the **legislative branch**, composed of the National Assembly and the National Council, is responsible for making laws. The **judicial branch**, composed of the Supreme Court and the High Court, is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring that they are in line with the constitution. Namibia's system of government is designed to provide checks and balances between the different branches, preventing any one branch from dominating the others.

The government of Namibia is also **unitary**, meaning that power is concentrated in the central government, rather than being divided between the central government and regional governments. This means that the central government has significant control over the country's affairs, although there are also **regional councils** that have some degree of autonomy.

Namibia's **constitution**, which was adopted in 1990, provides the framework for the country's system of government. It establishes the principles of **democracy**, **human rights**, and the **rule of law**, and provides for the protection of individual rights and freedoms. The constitution also provides for the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers between the different branches of government.
