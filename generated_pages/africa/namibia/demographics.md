[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Namibia is relatively small compared to other countries in Africa, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The country has a total area of approximately 825,615 km², with a population density of about 3.6 people per km². The population growth rate is estimated to be around 1.8% per annum, with a median age of 21.5 years. The urban population accounts for approximately 52% of the total population, with the majority of people living in urban areas such as Windhoek, the capital city, and other major towns. Namibia's population is also characterized by a high level of migration, with many people moving to urban areas in search of better economic opportunities.

The population of Namibia is also affected by factors such as HIV/AIDS, which has had a significant impact on the country's demographics. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is estimated to be around 12%, which is one of the highest in the world. This has resulted in a significant number of orphans and vulnerable children, who often rely on extended family members or other caregivers for support. Despite these challenges, Namibia has made significant progress in recent years in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS and improving the overall health and well-being of its population.

The population of Namibia is also characterized by a high level of urbanization, with many people moving to urban areas in search of better economic opportunities. This has resulted in the growth of urban centers such as Windhoek, Swakopmund, and Walvis Bay, which are now home to a significant proportion of the country's population. However, this urbanization has also created challenges such as overcrowding, poverty, and inequality, which the government and other stakeholders are working to address through a range of initiatives and programs.
