The primary education system is based on the **Namibian Curriculum**, which emphasizes the development of essential skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics. After completing primary education, students proceed to **secondary education**, which is also compulsory and lasts for five years. Secondary education is divided into two phases: junior secondary and senior secondary. The junior secondary phase focuses on providing students with a broad-based education, while the senior secondary phase allows students to specialize in specific subjects.\n\nThe quality of education in Namibia is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on providing students with practical skills and knowledge. However, there are some challenges facing the education system, including a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate infrastructure in some schools. Despite these challenges, the Namibian government has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including introducing new curricula and investing in teacher training programs. The education system in Namibia is also characterized by a mix of public and private schools, with private schools generally offering higher quality education but at a higher cost.\n\nIn terms of access to education, Namibia has made significant progress in recent years, with a significant increase in the number of students enrolled in school.
