# Namibia Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Namibia's culture is a unique blend of African, European, and indigenous influences. The country has a diverse ethnic and linguistic makeup, with over 20 different languages spoken. The main ethnic groups are the **Ovambo**, **Kavango**, **Herero**, **Himba**, and **San**. Each of these groups has its own distinct culture and traditions, which have been shaped by their history, geography, and interactions with other groups. The country's strategic location on the southern African coast has also made it a hub for trade and cultural exchange, with influences from European colonizers, African migrants, and Asian traders.

The **Ovambo** people, who make up the largest ethnic group in Namibia, have a rich cultural heritage that is characterized by their traditional music, dance, and art. The **Herero** people, on the other hand, are known for their distinctive dress and their traditional cattle-herding practices. The **Himba** people are famous for their unique beauty practices, which include covering their skin and hair with a mixture of butter and red ochre. The **San** people, who are the indigenous people of Namibia, have a deep connection with the natural environment and are known for their traditional hunting and gathering practices.

Namibia's cultural identity is also shaped by its history of colonization and apartheid. The country was a German colony from 1884 to 1915, and then a South African mandate territory from 1915 to 1990. This legacy of colonialism and apartheid has had a profound impact on the country's language, education, and cultural practices. Today, Namibia is a **sovereign** nation that is working to promote its unique cultural identity and to preserve its rich cultural heritage.
