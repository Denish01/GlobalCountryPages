[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Namibia's main international airport, Hosea Kutako International Airport, is located about 45 kilometers east of the capital city, Windhoek. The airport receives direct flights from several major hubs, including Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Frankfurt. You can also enter Namibia overland from neighboring countries, including Angola, Zambia, Botswana, and South Africa, via several border posts. The most popular overland entry points are the B1 highway from South Africa and the Trans-Kalahari Highway from Botswana.

If you're planning to enter Namibia by land, it's essential to research the necessary documentation and regulations in advance. You'll need a valid passport, visa (if required), and car insurance, as well as a valid driver's license if you're driving. Additionally, some border posts may have specific requirements, such as a police clearance certificate or a certified copy of your vehicle's registration.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Namibia's domestic air network is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between major towns. Air Namibia is the national carrier, offering flights from Windhoek to several domestic destinations, including Swakopmund, Walvis Bay, and Katima Mulilo. You can book flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way ticket from Windhoek to Swakopmund can cost around $200-$300.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Namibia's rail network is limited, with only a few passenger trains operating between major towns. The most popular route is the Desert Express, which runs from Windhoek to Swakopmund, offering stunning views of the Namib Desert. However, the train journey can be slow and uncomfortable, and prices are often comparable to flying. There are no high-speed trains in Namibia, and the booking process can be complicated, so it's recommended to book through a travel agent or tour operator.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Several bus companies operate intercity routes in Namibia, including Intercape and Econolux. These buses are a relatively affordable way to travel, with fares starting from around $20-$50 for a one-way ticket. However, the journey can be long and uncomfortable, and the bus network is not as extensive as in other countries. You can book tickets online or at the bus station, and it's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.
