[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public sector being the largest provider of education. However, the quality of education in public schools is often compromised due to inadequate funding, outdated curricula, and a shortage of qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools and international institutions offer higher-quality education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction is English, and education is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 15. International schools are available in major cities, offering curricula such as the British, American, or International Baccalaureate.

The Nigerian education system is facing several challenges, including a high dropout rate, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and the establishment of programs to support disadvantaged students. For expatriates, international schools are a popular option, offering a high-quality education and a familiar curriculum. However, these schools can be expensive, and fees may not include additional costs such as uniforms, textbooks, and extracurricular activities.
