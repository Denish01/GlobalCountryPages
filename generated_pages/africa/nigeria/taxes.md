[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria operates a **territorial taxation system**, where tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the taxpayer's residency status. However, residents are also taxed on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. The **residency rules** for tax purposes in Nigeria are based on physical presence, with individuals considered resident if they are present in the country for at least 183 days in a tax year. Other factors, such as the location of their permanent home, family, and business interests, may also be taken into account.

The tax system in Nigeria is administered by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), which is responsible for collecting taxes, as well as providing guidance and support to taxpayers. The tax year in Nigeria runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of March in the following year. Nigeria has a network of **double taxation treaties** with several countries, which aim to prevent taxing the same income in multiple jurisdictions.
