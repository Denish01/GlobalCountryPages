# Nigeria Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Nigeria before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. However, there are some exceptions for citizens of certain African countries. Currently, citizens of 17 African countries can enter Nigeria visa-free, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an electronic visa system. The Nigerian government has been working to improve its visa process, making it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit the country.

The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to promote tourism and economic development. The country has a lot to offer, from its vibrant culture to its rich natural resources, and the government is keen to attract visitors and investors. However, the visa process can be complex, and it is essential to understand the requirements and regulations before traveling to Nigeria.

**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a single-entry or multiple-entry visa, which is usually valid for 90 days. The typical stay for tourists is 30-60 days, but this can be extended for an additional 90 days. To apply for a tourist visa, visitors must provide proof of travel arrangements, accommodation, and sufficient funds.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers must obtain a business visa, which requires an invitation letter from a Nigerian company and proof of business activities. The requirements for business travelers are more stringent than for tourists, and the application process can take longer.
**Students:** Students must obtain a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment in a Nigerian educational institution and a letter of acceptance. The student visa is usually valid for the duration of the course, and students must register with the Nigerian immigration authorities within 30 days of arrival.
**Workers:** Workers must obtain a work visa, which requires a sponsorship letter from a Nigerian employer and proof of qualifications. The work visa is usually valid for one year, and workers must register with the Nigerian immigration authorities within 30 days of arrival.

Nigeria has several main airports, including Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. The country also has several land borders, including the border with Benin and the border with Cameroon. Upon arrival, visitors must go through immigration and customs, where they will be required to present their passport, visa, and other documents. The immigration process can be slow, and visitors should be prepared to wait in line. It is also essential to ensure that all documents are in order, as any discrepancies can lead to delays or even deportation.

Visitors must also declare any goods they are bringing into the country, including gifts and souvenirs. The customs process can be complex, and visitors should be aware of the regulations regarding the importation of goods. Failure to declare goods or comply with regulations can result in fines or even confiscation of goods.
