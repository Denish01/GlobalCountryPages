  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Nigeria varies significantly between public and private facilities, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 71.9% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $67\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 71.9%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: NGN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nNigeria's healthcare system is a mixed model, comprising both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in limited access to quality care, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality services, but at a higher cost, making them inaccessible to a significant portion of the population. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and affluent Nigerians tend to opt for private healthcare services. Having health insurance is highly recommended, as it can provide financial protection against unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Nigeria is also plagued by issues such as inadequate infrastructure, shortage of medical professionals, and lack of access to specialized care. Despite these challenges, there are efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the implementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and the construction of new healthcare facilities. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between different regions and socioeconomic groups.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's expertise |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices depend on the specialist's field and experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Prices include basic cleaning and examination |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Prices include basic eye test and prescription |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by type of test and laboratory |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$100 | Prices depend on the severity of the condition and hospital facilities |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and type of accommodation |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$1,000 | Prices depend on the type of surgery and surgeon's expertise |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$500 | Prices include basic care and hospital stay |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices depend on the type of X-ray and hospital facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$30 | Outpatient care, basic surgeries, and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Inpatient and outpatient care, specialist consultations, and advanced procedures |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription, with prices ranging from $5 to $50 per unit.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available at pharmacies and markets, with prices starting from $2.\n- **Vaccinations** are available at public health centers and private clinics, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 per dose.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.\n- **Medication quality** can vary, and it is essential to purchase medications from reputable pharmacies.\n- **Prescription rules** require a valid prescription from a licensed doctor, and some medications may be subject to restrictions or special requirements.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 112, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. **Ambulance services** are available in some cities, but may not be reliable or widespread. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek care at private hospitals, which often have better facilities and more experienced staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Nigeria include the **Reddington Hospital** in Lagos and the **Nigerian Turkish Nile University Hospital** in Abuja. These hospitals offer a range of services, including emergency care, surgery, and specialized treatments, and have a reputation for providing high-quality care. However, it is crucial to note that even in these hospitals, the quality of care can vary, and it is essential to have adequate health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses.",
