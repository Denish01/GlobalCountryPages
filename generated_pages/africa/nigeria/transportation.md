[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Nigeria has several international airports, with Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja being the main entry points. These airports receive direct flights from major hubs in Europe, the Middle East, and other parts of Africa. You can also enter Nigeria overland from neighboring countries, including Benin, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon, although this may require more planning and documentation. The main overland entry points are at the border towns of Badagry, Idiroko, and Katsina.

The country's strategic location in West Africa makes it a popular destination for travelers and businessmen. Many international airlines operate flights to Nigeria, including British Airways, Emirates, and Turkish Airlines. If you're planning to enter Nigeria overland, make sure to research the required documentation and regulations, as these can change frequently. It's also a good idea to check with your embassy or consulate for the latest travel advisories and requirements.

Nigeria has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities. The main domestic airlines are Arik Air, Air Peace, and Dana Air, which operate flights to destinations such as Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Kano. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way ticket from Lagos to Abuja can cost around $100-$200, while a ticket from Lagos to Port Harcourt can cost around $50-$100.
