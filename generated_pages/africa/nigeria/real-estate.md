[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Nigerian property market is a growing and dynamic sector, driven by the country's large and increasing population. The market is characterized by a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in urban areas, which has led to a significant increase in property prices in recent years. The trend is expected to continue, with prices rising by up to 10% per annum in some areas. The market can be broadly divided into urban and rural areas, with the former experiencing much higher demand and prices. Cities such as Lagos and Abuja are the main hubs for commercial and residential property, while rural areas are largely underdeveloped.

The Nigerian property market is also influenced by the country's economy, which is heavily reliant on oil exports. The market has experienced fluctuations in recent years due to changes in global oil prices, but it is expected to stabilize in the coming years. The government has also implemented several initiatives to boost the property sector, including the introduction of new mortgage laws and the establishment of a national housing fund.

Despite the challenges, the Nigerian property market offers significant opportunities for investors, particularly in the **real estate** and **construction** sectors. The demand for housing is high, and the market is expected to continue growing in the coming years. However, investors need to be aware of the risks and challenges associated with investing in Nigeria, including **bureaucratic delays**, **corruption**, and **infrastructure challenges**.
