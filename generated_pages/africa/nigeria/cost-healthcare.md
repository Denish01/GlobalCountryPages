[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria's healthcare system is a mixed model, comprising both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in limited access to quality care, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality services, but at a higher cost, making them inaccessible to a significant portion of the population. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and affluent Nigerians tend to opt for private healthcare services. Having health insurance is highly recommended, as it can provide financial protection against unexpected medical expenses.

The healthcare system in Nigeria is also plagued by issues such as inadequate infrastructure, shortage of medical professionals, and lack of access to specialized care. Despite these challenges, there are efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the implementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and the construction of new healthcare facilities. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between different regions and socioeconomic groups.
