The executive branch is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people, while the legislative branch is composed of the National Assembly, which is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the land.\n\nThe Nigerian system is a **presidential system**, where the President serves as both the head of state and the head of government.

The country is divided into six geopolitical zones, each with its own unique cultural, economic, and historical characteristics.
