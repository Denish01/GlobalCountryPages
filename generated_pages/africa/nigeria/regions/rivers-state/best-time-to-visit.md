[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Rivers State, located in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, has a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The region experiences two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is marked by low humidity and moderate temperatures, making it the best time to visit Rivers State. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is characterized by heavy rainfall and flooding, which can make travel difficult. The climate in Rivers State is influenced by its proximity to the equator and the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in a relatively constant temperature range throughout the year.

The dry season is the best time to visit Rivers State, as the weather is generally dry and sunny, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C. This season is ideal for outdoor activities such as sightseeing, hiking, and water sports. The wet season, on the other hand, is characterized by heavy rainfall and flooding, which can make travel difficult and disrupt outdoor activities. However, the wet season is also a time of lush vegetation and green landscapes, making it a good time to visit for nature lovers and photographers.

The seasons in Rivers State also affect travel in terms of crowds and prices. During the peak season, which runs from December to January, tourist attractions and accommodations are usually crowded, and prices are at their highest. The budget season, which runs from June to September, is a good time to visit for budget-conscious travelers, as prices are lower, and there are fewer crowds. However, travelers should be aware that the budget season coincides with the wet season, and some outdoor activities may be disrupted by heavy rainfall.
