[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
FCT Abuja has a tropical savanna climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which lasts from November to March, is characterized by cool and dry weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C. This season is ideal for outdoor activities, such as hiking, sightseeing, and exploring the city's attractions.

The wet season is further divided into two periods: the early wet season, from April to June, and the late wet season, from July to October.

The dry and wet seasons have a significant impact on travel in FCT Abuja. During the dry season, the roads are easier to navigate, and the weather is more pleasant, making it an ideal time for tourists. In contrast, the wet season can make travel difficult, as the roads become slippery and flooded, and the high humidity can be uncomfortable. Additionally, some attractions and tourist sites may be closed or inaccessible during the wet season due to flooding or maintenance.

The climate in FCT Abuja is also influenced by its location in the tropics, with the sun shining brightly throughout the year. The city's elevation, which is approximately 350 meters above sea level, also contributes to its relatively cool climate compared to other parts of Nigeria. Overall, the dry season is the best time to visit FCT Abuja, as it offers pleasant weather, easy travel, and access to all the city's attractions.
