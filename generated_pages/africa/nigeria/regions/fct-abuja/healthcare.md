[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in FCT Abuja is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is primarily responsible for providing healthcare to the majority of the population, with a network of government-owned hospitals and clinics. However, the public sector is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of resources and long waiting times. In contrast, the private sector offers higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost, making it inaccessible to many. The quality of care in FCT Abuja is generally considered to be **good**, with many well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities, particularly in the private sector. However, there are still significant challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to healthcare is limited and the quality of care can be **basic**.

The **urban-rural divide** is a significant challenge in FCT Abuja, with many rural areas lacking access to even basic healthcare services. In contrast, urban areas such as Abuja have a wide range of healthcare providers, including modern hospitals and specialist clinics. The Nigerian government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including the **National Health Insurance Scheme**, which aims to increase access to healthcare for all citizens. However, the scheme is still in its early stages, and many challenges remain, particularly in terms of funding and implementation.

Despite these challenges, FCT Abuja has a relatively high **density of healthcare providers**, with many well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities, particularly in the private sector. This has made it an attractive destination for **medical tourism**, with many foreigners traveling to Abuja for specialist care and procedures. However, there are still significant challenges, particularly in terms of **emergency care**, with many hospitals lacking the resources and equipment to provide timely and effective treatment.
