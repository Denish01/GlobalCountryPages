It is bordered by several states, including Niger State to the west and north, Kaduna State to the north and northeast, Nassarawa State to the east and southeast, Kogi State to the southwest, and Plateau State to the southeast. The territory is landlocked, with no direct access to the sea. Its strategic location allows for easy access to all parts of the country, making it an ideal location for the country's capital.\n\nThe FCT Abuja is also located near the geographic center of Nigeria, which made it an attractive location for the country's capital when it was moved from Lagos in 1991. The territory's location allows for a more even distribution of power and resources across the country, and its relatively central location has helped to promote national unity. The FCT Abuja is also close to several major rivers, including the Niger River and the Benue River, which provide water and support agriculture in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe terrain of the FCT Abuja is characterized by a mix of grasslands, savannas, and rocky outcrops. The territory is situated in the Nigerian Highlands, a region of elevated terrain that stretches across central Nigeria. The landscape is generally flat, with some rolling hills and valleys. The terrain is also dotted with several rocky outcrops, including the famous Zuma Rock, which is a prominent landmark in the region. The rock formations in the area are primarily composed of granite and gneiss, which are common in the Nigerian Highlands.\n\nThe FCT Abuja is also home to several rivers and streams, including the Abuja River, which flows through the city and provides water for the local population. The territory's terrain is also suitable for agriculture, with several farms and agricultural projects located in the area.

The territory's landscape is also home to several natural forests, including the Kuje Forest Reserve, which provides a habitat for a variety of wildlife, including monkeys, antelopes, and birds.\n\nThe FCT Abuja's terrain and landscape have been shaped by a combination of geological and climatic factors. The territory's location in the Nigerian Highlands has resulted in a landscape that is characterized by a mix of grasslands, savannas, and rocky outcrops. The climate in the region is also influenced by the territory's elevation, with the higher elevations resulting in a cooler and more temperate climate. The FCT Abuja's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by human activities, including agriculture and urbanization, which have resulted in significant changes to the natural environment.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION] continuation \nIn addition to its natural features, the FCT Abuja is also home to several man-made lakes and reservoirs, including the Lower Usuma Dam and the Gurara Dam.
