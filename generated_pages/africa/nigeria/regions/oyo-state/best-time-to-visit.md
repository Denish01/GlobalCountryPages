[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Oyo State, located in the southwestern part of Nigeria, has a tropical savanna climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to February, is characterized by cooler temperatures, low humidity, and minimal rainfall. This period is ideal for outdoor activities, such as hiking, visiting historical sites, and exploring the state's natural attractions. In contrast, the wet season, which runs from March to November, is marked by high temperatures, high humidity, and heavy rainfall, making it less suitable for outdoor activities.

The dry season is further divided into two sub-seasons: the harmattan season, which occurs from December to January, and the hot dry season, which occurs from February to March. The harmattan season is characterized by a dry, cool wind that blows from the Sahara Desert, while the hot dry season is marked by increasing temperatures and humidity. The wet season, on the other hand, is characterized by heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and high humidity, making it challenging for travelers to navigate the state's roads and attractions.

The seasons in Oyo State have a significant impact on travel, as they affect the accessibility of roads, the availability of accommodations, and the overall comfort of travelers. During the dry season, roads are generally in good condition, and accommodations are readily available, making it an ideal time to visit the state's attractions. In contrast, the wet season can make roads impassable, and accommodations may be limited, making it more challenging for travelers to navigate the state.
