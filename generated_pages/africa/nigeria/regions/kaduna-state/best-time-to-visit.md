[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Kaduna State has a tropical savanna climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from November to May, is characterized by hot and dry weather, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C. The wet season, which runs from June to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity. The dry season is the best time to visit Kaduna State, as the weather is more comfortable and conducive to outdoor activities. The state's climate is also influenced by its location in the northern part of Nigeria, where the **Harmattan** wind blows from the Sahara Desert, bringing dry and cool air.

The seasons in Kaduna State have a significant impact on travel, as the weather can be quite extreme. During the wet season, the heavy rainfall can make roads impassable, and the high humidity can make it uncomfortable for tourists. On the other hand, the dry season is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, sightseeing, and cultural events. However, the dry season is also the peak tourist season, and prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher.

The climate zones in Kaduna State also vary, with the northern part of the state being drier and hotter than the southern part. The state's geography, with its **Guinea Savannah** vegetation, also plays a role in shaping its climate. The savannah vegetation helps to regulate the temperature and provides a natural barrier against the harsh weather conditions.
