[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria's rental market is characterized by a high demand for housing, particularly in urban areas such as Lagos and Abuja. The typical lease term is one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are generally limited, and renters may face challenges in negotiating with landlords. Compared to regional neighbors, Nigeria's housing costs are relatively high, with prices in cities like Lagos and Abuja comparable to those in other major West African cities. However, the country's large and growing population, combined with a shortage of affordable housing, has driven up prices and created a competitive rental market.

The Nigerian housing market is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including a high inflation rate of 33.2% and a relatively low GDP per capita of $9,087. The high inflation rate can make it challenging for renters to afford housing, as prices may increase rapidly over time. Additionally, the country's limited investment in education and healthcare, with education spend accounting for only 0.3% of GDP, may affect the overall quality of life and living standards in Nigeria.
