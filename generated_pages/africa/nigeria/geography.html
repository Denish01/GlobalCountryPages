        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Nigeria is located in West Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea in the south. The country is situated between latitudes 4° and 14° north of the equator, and longitudes 3° and 15° east of the prime meridian. Nigeria shares its borders with several countries, including Benin to the west, Niger to the north, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the east. The country's coastline along the Gulf of Guinea provides access to the Atlantic Ocean, making it an important hub for maritime trade.</p>
        <p>Nigeria's strategic location in West Africa has made it a significant player in regional and international affairs. The country's borders with its neighbors have been largely stable, although there have been occasional tensions and disputes over the years. The border with Benin, for example, has been the subject of a long-standing dispute over the ownership of several small islands in the Niger Delta. Despite these challenges, Nigeria has maintained good relations with its neighbors and has played a key role in regional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Nigeria's terrain is diverse, with a range of landscapes that include mountains, forests, savannas, and coastal plains. The country's highest point is Chappal Waddi, which is located in the Taraba State and rises to an elevation of 2,419 meters. The <strong>Niger Delta</strong>, which is located in the southern part of the country, is a network of rivers, creeks, and wetlands that empty into the Gulf of Guinea. The delta is home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including mangrove forests, salt marshes, and numerous species of fish and wildlife.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Jos Plateau</strong>, which is located in the central part of the country, is a region of highlands that rises to an elevation of over 1,000 meters. The plateau is known for its cooler climate, scenic beauty, and rich mineral deposits, including tin, columbite, and coal. The <strong>Sahel region</strong>, which is located in the north, is a transitional zone between the Sahara Desert and the savannas of West Africa. The region is characterized by a dry climate, with limited vegetation and a sparse population.</p>
        <p>Nigeria's coastline along the Gulf of Guinea is approximately 853 kilometers long, with a range of beaches, lagoons, and estuaries. The coastline is an important habitat for marine life, including sea turtles, dolphins, and numerous species of fish. The <strong>Lagos Lagoon</strong>, which is located in the southwestern part of the country, is a large body of water that is connected to the Gulf of Guinea by a network of rivers and canals. The lagoon is an important center for fishing and commerce, with numerous markets and ports.</p>
