[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nNigeria has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. However, there are some exceptions for citizens of certain African countries. Currently, citizens of 17 African countries can enter Nigeria visa-free, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an electronic visa system. The Nigerian government has been working to improve its visa process, making it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit the country.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to promote tourism and economic development. The country has a lot to offer, from its vibrant culture to its rich natural resources, and the government is keen to attract visitors and investors. However, the visa process can be complex, and it is essential to understand the requirements and regulations before traveling to Nigeria.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa | 90 days | Must apply in advance, cannot obtain visa on arrival |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa | 90 days | Can apply for e-visa, but must meet specific requirements |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa | 90 days | Some EU citizens can obtain visa on arrival, but must meet specific requirements |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa | 90 days | Must apply in advance, cannot obtain visa on arrival |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa | 90 days | Can apply for e-visa, but must meet specific requirements |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa | 90 days | Must apply in advance, cannot obtain visa on arrival |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa | 90 days | Must apply in advance, cannot obtain visa on arrival |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a single-entry or multiple-entry visa, which is usually valid for 90 days.
