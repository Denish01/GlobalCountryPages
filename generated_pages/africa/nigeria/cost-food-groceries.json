The country's **inflation rate** of 33.2% in 2024 has contributed to the increasing cost of food, making it challenging for many Nigerians to afford basic necessities. Despite this, eating out is a common practice in Nigeria, with many restaurants and street food vendors offering a wide range of local and international dishes. However, home cooking remains a staple in many Nigerian households, with many people opting to prepare their own meals to save money.\n\nThe eating-out culture in Nigeria is vibrant, with many restaurants and bars offering a range of options from traditional Nigerian dishes to international cuisine. However, the high cost of food and other expenses has led to a decline in the number of people eating out, with many opting for more affordable options such as street food or home-cooked meals. The **GDP per capita PPP** of $9,087 in 2024 indicates a relatively low standard of living, which can make it difficult for many Nigerians to afford expensive food options.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 750 NGN | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.00 | 500 NGN | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 1,000 NGN | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50 | 750 NGN | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $5.00 | 2,500 NGN | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $8.00 | 4,000 NGN | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 1,500 NGN | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 500 NGN | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 500 NGN | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.50 | 250 NGN | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00 | 2,500 NGN | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 500 NGN | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes such as jollof rice, suya) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$40 | (3 courses, drinks) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, 3-5 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Nigeria. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and other essentials at lower prices, but the quality and variety may not be as consistent. It is generally recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported items. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and visitors can expect to haggle over prices to get the best deal.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with some items costing up to 50% more at supermarkets. However, the convenience and variety offered by supermarkets may be worth the extra cost for some shoppers. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a unique and immersive shopping experience, with the opportunity to interact with local vendors and try fresh, locally sourced products. Visitors can expect to find a wide range of goods at local markets, from fresh produce to handicrafts and souvenirs.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries or street food stalls is a great way to save money, with meals starting from $3-$5 USD.\n- Local staples such as **jollof rice**, **suya**, and **egusi soup** are delicious and affordable options.\n- Fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, is generally cheaper at local markets.\n- Buying in bulk can help reduce costs, especially for items such as rice and beans.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- **Palm oil** is a common ingredient in Nigerian cuisine and is relatively inexpensive, making it a good option for cooking.",
