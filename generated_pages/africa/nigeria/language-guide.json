The official language, English, is widely used for official purposes, education, and business, but the majority of the population also speaks one or more indigenous languages. Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo are the most widely spoken languages, with Hausa being the most widely spoken in the north, Yoruba in the southwest, and Igbo in the southeast. Regional dialects and minority languages are also common, and the linguistic landscape of Nigeria is characterized by a complex mix of languages and dialects. English is widely understood in urban areas, particularly among the educated population, but proficiency can vary greatly depending on the region and level of education.\n\nThe use of indigenous languages is an important part of Nigerian culture and identity, and many Nigerians are multilingual, speaking two or more languages fluently. However, English remains the dominant language for official purposes, and it is widely used in government, education, and business. The linguistic diversity of Nigeria can also present challenges for communication, particularly for visitors who do not speak English or an indigenous language. However, many Nigerians are eager to communicate with visitors and are willing to use simple English or gestures to facilitate communication.\n\nIn addition to the linguistic diversity, Nigeria also has a rich tradition of oral storytelling and music, with many languages having their own unique literary and musical traditions. The country is also home to a thriving film industry, known as Nollywood, which produces films in a variety of languages, including English, Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Nigeria is complex and diverse, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage and history.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Kedu (Igbo), Bawo ni (Yoruba), Sannu (Hausa) | Keh-du, Bah-woh nee, Sah-nu | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Imeela (Igbo), E se (Yoruba), Na gode (Hausa) | Ee-meh-lah, Eh shay, Nah goh-deh |  |\n| Please | Biko (Igbo), E wo (Yoruba), Abinci (Hausa) | Bee-koh, Eh wo, Ah-been-chee |  |\n| Yes / No | Ee / Mba (Igbo), Ee / Rara (Yoruba), Ee / A'a (Hausa) | Ay / M-bah, Ay / Rah-rah, Ay / Ah-ah |  |\n| Excuse me | Kedu ka ina (Igbo), E ma binu (Yoruba), Gafara (Hausa) | Keh-du kah ee-nah, Eh mah bee-noo, Gah-fah-rah |  |\n| How much? | Mgbe ahụ (Igbo), Eko ni (Yoruba), Nawa ne (Hausa) | M-gbeh ah-hoo, Eh-koh nee, Nah-wah neh |  |\n| Where is...? | Ebe ino (Igbo), Ebi ni (Yoruba), Ina ne (Hausa) | Eh-beh ee-noh, Eh-bee nee, Ee-nah neh |  |\n| I don't understand | A na-amụghị (Igbo), N soro (Yoruba), Ba na fahimta (Hausa) | Ah nah ah-moo-gee, N soh-roh, Bah nah fah-heem-tah |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Ị na-asụ Bekee (Igbo), O n so ede Geesi (Yoruba), Kai ka zauci Turanci (Hausa) | Ee nah ah-soo Bay-keh, Oh n soh eh-deh Gay-see, Kai kah zoo-chee Too-ran-chee |  |\n| Help! | Ị ga-enyem aka (Igbo), E ran mi (Yoruba), Ka taimaka (Hausa) | Ee gah ehn-yem ah-kah, Eh rahn mee, Kah tie-mah-kah |  |\n| Goodbye | Ka chi fo (Igbo), O dabọ (Yoruba), Sai an jima (Hausa) | Kah chee foh, Oh dah-boh, Sai ahn jee-mah |  |\n| Sorry | Mgbaghara (Igbo), E ma binu (Yoruba), Gafara (Hausa) | M-gbah-gah-rah, Eh mah bee-noo, Gah-fah-rah |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Otu (Igbo), Okan (Yoruba), Daya (Hausa) | Oh-too, Oh-kahn, Dah-yah |\n| 2 | Abu (Igbo), Eji (Yoruba), Biyu (Hausa) | Ah-boo, Eh-jee, Bee-yoo |\n| 3 | Atọ (Igbo), Eta (Yoruba), Uku (Hausa) | Ah-toh, Eh-tah, Oo-koo |\n| 4 | Anọ (Igbo), Eri (Yoruba), Hudu (Hausa) | Ah-noh, Eh-ree, Hoo-doo |\n| 5 | Ise (Igbo), Aarin (Yoruba), Biyar (Hausa) | Ee-seh, Ah-rin, Bee-yar |\n| 6 | Isii (Igbo), Efa (Yoruba), Shida (Hausa) | Ee-see, Eh-fah, Shee-dah |\n| 7 | Asaa (Igbo), Eje (Yoruba), Bakwai (Hausa) | Ah-sah, Eh-jeh, Bah-kwhy |\n| 8 | Asato (Igbo), Ejo (Yoruba), Takwas (Hausa) | Ah-sah-toh, Eh-joh, Tah-kwahs |\n| 9 | Itolu (Igbo), Eson (Yoruba), Tara (Hausa) | Ee-toh-loo, Eh-sohn, Tah-rah |\n| 10 | Iri (Igbo), Ewa (Yoruba), Goma (Hausa) | Ee-ree, Eh-wah, Goh-mah |\n| 100 | Nari (Igbo), Ogorin (Yoruba), Dari (Hausa) | Nah-ree, Oh-goh-rin, Dah-ree |\n| 1000 | Puku (Igbo), Ile (Yoruba), Dubu (Hausa) | Poo-koo, Ee-leh, Doo-boo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when interacting with Nigerians, as **formality** is highly valued in the culture.\n- Use **body language** to show respect, such as bowing your head or using a slight bow when greeting someone.\n- Avoid **public displays of affection**, as they are generally frowned upon in Nigerian culture.\n- Use **simple language** and avoid jargon or technical terms when communicating with Nigerians who may not speak English fluently.\n- Be **patient** and **open-minded** when communicating with Nigerians, as cultural and linguistic differences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\n- Use **hand gestures** to facilitate communication, but avoid pointing with your left hand, as it is considered rude in some cultures.\n- Learn a few **basic phrases** in the local language, such as greetings and expressions of gratitude, to show respect and appreciation for the culture.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download **Google Translate** or other translation apps to help facilitate communication.\n- Carry a **phrasebook** or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Use **online resources**, such as language learning websites or cultural guides, to learn more about Nigerian culture and language.\n- Take a **language course** or work with a **language tutor** to improve your language skills and learn more about Nigerian culture.\n- Use **local guides** or **interpreters** to help facilitate communication and provide cultural insights.",
