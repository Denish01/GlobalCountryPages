However, the quality of education in public schools is often compromised due to inadequate funding, outdated curricula, and a shortage of qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools and international institutions offer higher-quality education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction is English, and education is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 15. International schools are available in major cities, offering curricula such as the British, American, or International Baccalaureate.\n\nThe Nigerian education system is facing several challenges, including a high dropout rate, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and the establishment of programs to support disadvantaged students. For expatriates, international schools are a popular option, offering a high-quality education and a familiar curriculum. However, these schools can be expensive, and fees may not include additional costs such as uniforms, textbooks, and extracurricular activities.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can be poor, with inadequate facilities and teacher shortages |\n| Private Primary | $200-$1,000 | Range depends on school tier and location, with top-tier schools offering better facilities and more qualified teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can be poor, with inadequate facilities and teacher shortages |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,500 | Range depends on school tier and location, with top-tier schools offering better facilities and more qualified teachers |\n| International School | $2,000-$10,000 | Offers British, American, or International Baccalaureate curricula, with fees varying depending on school reputation and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Fees vary depending on institution and program, with international students paying higher fees |\n| Private University | $1,000-$5,000 | $2,000-$10,000 | Fees vary depending on institution and program, with international students paying higher fees |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$10,000 | Institutions like the University of Lagos and the University of Ibadan offer high-quality programs, but with higher fees |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Fees vary depending on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Fees vary depending on tutor qualifications and subject area |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$200 | Fees vary depending on language and course provider |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Fees vary depending on school and program, with international schools often requiring more expensive supplies |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Fees vary depending on school and program, with international schools often requiring more expensive uniforms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats are often international schools, which offer a high-quality education and a familiar curriculum.\n- Scholarships are available for Nigerian students, but these are often limited and competitive.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular, with many institutions offering distance learning programs.\n- Education quality in Nigeria is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, with public schools facing significant challenges.\n- [CALLOUT] It is essential to research schools thoroughly and consider factors such as curriculum, teacher qualifications, and facilities when choosing an institution.\n- For students seeking to study abroad, there are several organizations that offer scholarships and financial aid, such as the **Fulbright Program** and the **Commonwealth Scholarship**.",
