[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Nigeria's government is based on the principles of federalism, with power divided between the federal government and the 36 states, as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The **separation of powers** is a key feature of the Nigerian system, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The executive branch is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people, while the legislative branch is composed of the National Assembly, which is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the land.

The Nigerian system is a **presidential system**, where the President serves as both the head of state and the head of government. This is in contrast to a **parliamentary system**, where the head of government is separate from the head of state. The presidential system is designed to provide strong leadership and stability, while also providing checks and balances on the power of the executive branch.

Nigeria's federal system is designed to promote **regional autonomy** and **diversity**, while also providing a framework for national unity and cohesion. The country is divided into six geopolitical zones, each with its own unique cultural, economic, and historical characteristics. The federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and national security, while the states are responsible for matters such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.
