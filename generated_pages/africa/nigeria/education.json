  "content": "The education system in Nigeria is a complex and multifaceted structure, with a wide range of options available for students, from primary to tertiary levels, with both public and private institutions offering varying degrees of quality and accessibility.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 59.6%\nSchool System: 9 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: English\nAcademic Calendar: 10 months\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 1000 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Nigeria is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children, lasts for six years and is followed by three years of junior secondary school. Students who complete junior secondary school can then proceed to senior secondary school, which lasts for three years and culminates in the **West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE)**. The quality of education in Nigeria varies widely, with public schools often struggling with inadequate funding and resources, while private schools tend to offer higher standards of education but at a significantly higher cost. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of **free primary education** and the establishment of **teacher training programs**.\n\nThe tertiary education system in Nigeria consists of universities, polytechnics, and colleges of education. The country has a total of 43 federal universities, 52 state universities, and 79 private universities, offering a wide range of academic programs. However, the quality of tertiary education in Nigeria is often criticized, with many institutions facing challenges such as inadequate funding, outdated curriculum, and lack of infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Nigerian universities have made significant strides in recent years, with some institutions ranking among the top 1000 universities globally.\n\nThe education system in Nigeria is also characterized by a significant disparity between public and private institutions. While public schools are often underfunded and overcrowded, private schools tend to offer better facilities, more qualified teachers, and smaller class sizes. This has resulted in a significant gap in the quality of education between students from wealthy families and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. To address this issue, the government has implemented policies such as the **National Education Policy**, which aims to promote equal access to quality education for all Nigerians.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
