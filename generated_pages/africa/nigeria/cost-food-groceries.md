[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Nigeria are generally higher than the regional average, driven by factors such as high transportation costs, inflation, and a large population. The country's **inflation rate** of 33.2% in 2024 has contributed to the increasing cost of food, making it challenging for many Nigerians to afford basic necessities. Despite this, eating out is a common practice in Nigeria, with many restaurants and street food vendors offering a wide range of local and international dishes. However, home cooking remains a staple in many Nigerian households, with many people opting to prepare their own meals to save money.

The eating-out culture in Nigeria is vibrant, with many restaurants and bars offering a range of options from traditional Nigerian dishes to international cuisine. However, the high cost of food and other expenses has led to a decline in the number of people eating out, with many opting for more affordable options such as street food or home-cooked meals. The **GDP per capita PPP** of $9,087 in 2024 indicates a relatively low standard of living, which can make it difficult for many Nigerians to afford expensive food options.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Nigeria. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and other essentials at lower prices, but the quality and variety may not be as consistent. It is generally recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported items. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and visitors can expect to haggle over prices to get the best deal.

The price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with some items costing up to 50% more at supermarkets. However, the convenience and variety offered by supermarkets may be worth the extra cost for some shoppers. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a unique and immersive shopping experience, with the opportunity to interact with local vendors and try fresh, locally sourced products. Visitors can expect to find a wide range of goods at local markets, from fresh produce to handicrafts and souvenirs.
