[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Nigeria is located in West Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea in the south. The country is situated between latitudes 4° and 14° north of the equator, and longitudes 3° and 15° east of the prime meridian. Nigeria shares its borders with several countries, including Benin to the west, Niger to the north, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the east. The country's coastline along the Gulf of Guinea provides access to the Atlantic Ocean, making it an important hub for maritime trade.

Nigeria's strategic location in West Africa has made it a significant player in regional and international affairs. The country's borders with its neighbors have been largely stable, although there have been occasional tensions and disputes over the years. The border with Benin, for example, has been the subject of a long-standing dispute over the ownership of several small islands in the Niger Delta. Despite these challenges, Nigeria has maintained good relations with its neighbors and has played a key role in regional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
