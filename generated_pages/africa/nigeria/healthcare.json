  "content": "Healthcare in Nigeria is a mixed system that combines public and private providers, with varying levels of quality and access across the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nNigeria's healthcare system is structured into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with public facilities providing the majority of healthcare services. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including inadequate funding, outdated equipment, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality care, but at a higher cost, making them inaccessible to many Nigerians. The quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with cities like Lagos and Abuja having more advanced medical facilities and better-trained staff. Rural areas, on the other hand, often have limited access to healthcare services, with many residents relying on traditional medicine and unqualified practitioners.\n\nThe Nigerian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), which aims to increase access to healthcare services for all citizens. However, the scheme has faced challenges in its implementation, and many Nigerians still lack access to quality healthcare. Despite these challenges, there are many well-equipped and staffed hospitals in Nigeria, particularly in the private sector, which cater to the needs of expatriates and affluent Nigerians.\n\nThe healthcare system in Nigeria also faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, with many facilities lacking basic amenities like electricity, water, and sanitation. This can have a significant impact on the quality of care provided, particularly in rural areas where these challenges are more pronounced. Efforts are being made to address these challenges, including investments in healthcare infrastructure and the development of new healthcare policies.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics

insurance coverage to Nigerians, but its coverage is limited and its implementation has been challenging.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but their coverage and quality can vary significantly, and they may not be recognized by all healthcare providers.\n- **International health insurance** is recommended for expatriates, as it provides more comprehensive coverage and access to better quality care, both within Nigeria and abroad.\n- The **cost of health insurance** in Nigeria can vary significantly, depending on the provider, the level of coverage, and the individual's health status.\n- **Pre-existing conditions** may not be covered by some insurance providers, and individuals with such conditions may need to seek specialized insurance coverage.\n\n[SECTION]

Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency services** are limited in Nigeria, and travelers should be prepared for emergencies by having a plan in place, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of transportation.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is a concern, and travelers should not rely solely on ambulance services in an emergency.\n- **Nearest hospitals**
