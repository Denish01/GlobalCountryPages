        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Nigeria's culture is a rich and diverse tapestry, woven from the threads of over 250 ethnic groups, with the three main groups being the <strong>Hausa</strong>, <strong>Yoruba</strong>, and <strong>Igbo</strong>. The country's cultural identity is shaped by its history, geography, and the interactions between its various ethnic and linguistic groups. Nigerian culture is known for its vibrant music, colorful textiles, and exquisite cuisine. The country's strategic location in West Africa has made it a crossroads of trade, cultural exchange, and migration, resulting in a unique blend of traditional and modern influences.</p>
        <p>The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Nigeria is complex, with over 500 languages spoken across the country. However, <strong>English</strong> is the official language, and it is widely spoken, particularly in urban areas. The country's cultural diversity is reflected in its many traditional festivals, music, and art forms, which are often specific to particular ethnic groups. For example, the <strong>Yoruba</strong> people are known for their elaborate masks and headdresses, while the <strong>Hausa</strong> people are famous for their intricately designed leatherwork.</p>
        <p>Nigeria's cultural identity is also influenced by its history of colonization and the subsequent adoption of Western values and practices. This has resulted in a unique blend of traditional and modern cultures, with many Nigerians embracing Western-style education, clothing, and music, while still maintaining their traditional customs and practices. The country's cultural landscape is constantly evolving, with new generations of Nigerians drawing on their rich cultural heritage to create innovative and dynamic art forms, music, and literature.</p>
