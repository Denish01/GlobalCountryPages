[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world, with a population that is projected to continue growing rapidly in the coming decades. The country's population size is significant, not only in terms of its sheer numbers but also in terms of its impact on the economy, infrastructure, and resources. The population growth rate is approximately 2.6%, which is one of the highest in the world, and this has put a strain on the country's resources, including healthcare, education, and housing. Nigeria is also experiencing rapid urbanization, with over 51% of the population living in urban areas, and this trend is expected to continue as more people move to cities in search of better economic opportunities.

The population of Nigeria is relatively young, with a median age of 18.3 years, and this has significant implications for the country's economy and development. The large youth population presents both opportunities and challenges, as it can provide a significant workforce and contribute to economic growth, but it also puts pressure on the education and healthcare systems. Nigeria is also experiencing significant migration patterns, both within the country and internationally, with many Nigerians moving to other countries in search of better economic opportunities.

The population of Nigeria is also characterized by significant regional disparities, with some regions experiencing much faster population growth than others. The southern regions of the country, particularly the Niger Delta, are experiencing rapid population growth due to urbanization and migration, while the northern regions are experiencing slower population growth due to factors such as poverty and limited access to education and healthcare.
