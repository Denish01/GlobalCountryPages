# Nigeria Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Nigeria's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant gaps in rural areas, despite recent investments and development projects aimed at improving the country's roads, power, water, and telecommunications networks.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 59% of population
Internet Penetration: 46%
Road Network: 195,000 km, with 30% paved
Rail Network: 3,505 km
Major Airports: 22
Major Ports: 8
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries with similar economic profiles. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in new power plants, roads, and telecommunications infrastructure. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address these gaps, including the **National Infrastructure Master Plan**, which aims to improve the country's infrastructure stock and promote economic growth.

Despite these efforts, Nigeria's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including inadequate funding, corruption, and bureaucratic inefficiencies. The country's infrastructure sector is also heavily reliant on **foreign investment**, which can be unpredictable and subject to fluctuations in global commodity prices. To address these challenges, the government has established several institutions, including the **Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission**, which is responsible for promoting private sector participation in infrastructure development.

The Nigerian government has also launched several initiatives to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, including the **Ease of Doing Business** reform program, which aims to simplify regulatory procedures and reduce bureaucratic hurdles. These efforts have yielded some positive results, with Nigeria rising in the **World Bank's Ease of Doing Business** rankings in recent years. However, more needs to be done to address the country's infrastructure gaps and promote sustainable economic growth.
