# Best Time to Visit Nigeria — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Nigeria is during the dry season, from December to February, when the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for traveling and exploring the country.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Nigeria: December to February. Peak season: December to February. Budget season: June to September. Avoid: March to May and September to November due to heavy rainfall and high humidity. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to February, is characterized by dry and cool weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22 to 28 degrees Celsius. This season is ideal for traveling, as the weather is pleasant and the roads are more accessible. The wet season, which runs from March to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it more challenging to travel and explore the country.

The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the **Savanna** zone in the north and the **Tropical Rainforest** zone in the south. The Savanna zone experiences a longer dry season, while the Tropical Rainforest zone receives more rainfall throughout the year. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as the wet season can cause flooding and landslides, making some areas inaccessible.

In addition to the two main seasons, Nigeria also experiences a **Harmattan** season, which runs from December to February. During this period, a dry and dusty wind blows from the Sahara Desert, bringing cooler temperatures and a dry atmosphere. This season is ideal for traveling, as the weather is pleasant and the air is dry.
