[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Nigeria's utility infrastructure is still developing, and the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location. In urban areas like Lagos and Abuja, the infrastructure is more developed, and the services are generally more reliable. However, in rural areas, the infrastructure is often lacking, and the services can be intermittent. The costs of utilities in Nigeria are also subject to fluctuations due to factors like inflation and currency exchange rates. The inflation rate in Nigeria is currently at 33.2%, which can impact the cost of utilities and other essential services.

The cost of utilities in Nigeria can also vary depending on the season. During the dry season, the cost of water and electricity can increase due to higher demand. In contrast, during the rainy season, the cost of water can decrease due to the abundance of rainfall. It is essential to note that these seasonal variations can impact the overall cost of utilities and should be factored into the budget.
