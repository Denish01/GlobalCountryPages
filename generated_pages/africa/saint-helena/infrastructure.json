  "content": "The infrastructure in Saint Helena is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on improving access to basic services such as electricity, water, and telecommunications, despite the challenges posed by the island's remote location and limited resources.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 23%\nRoad Network: 118 km, moderate quality with some unpaved sections\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSaint Helena's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other small island territories, with a strong emphasis on providing essential services to its population. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the island's road network, improving access to electricity and water, and expanding telecommunications services. However, there is still a noticeable urban-rural gap, with Jamestown and other urban areas generally having better access to services than rural areas. The Saint Helena Government has been working to address these disparities through targeted investments and development projects.\n\nThe island's remote location and limited resources pose significant challenges to infrastructure development, with high transportation costs and limited access to specialized expertise and equipment. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant progress in recent years, with the completion of several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of a new wharf and the upgrade of the island's airport.\n\nSaint Helena's infrastructure development is also influenced by its status as a British Overseas Territory, with the UK providing significant funding and technical support for infrastructure projects. This support has been instrumental in helping the island to develop its infrastructure and improve access to basic services.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 118 km | Moderate | Some unpaved sections, particularly in rural areas |\n| Railways | 0 km | - | No railway network on the island |\n| Airports | 1 international, 0 domestic | Good | Saint Helena Airport, also known as HMS Belfast Airport, opened in 2017 |\n| Ports | 1 major | Good | Jamestown Wharf, upgraded in 2018 to accommodate larger vessels |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The primary source of power generation is diesel-powered, with a total installed capacity of 6.5 MW.\n- The island's electricity supply is generally reliable, with an average of 2-3 outages per year.\n- The government has been working to reduce the island's reliance on diesel-powered generation, with plans to introduce renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n- A new **solar farm** is currently under construction, which will provide up to 1 MW of electricity and help reduce the island's carbon footprint.\n- The island's electricity grid is relatively well-developed, with 100% of the population having access to electricity.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Tap water is generally safe to drink, with the island's water supply sourced from a combination of groundwater and desalination.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- Water access in rural areas can be limited, with some communities relying on **rainwater harvesting** and other alternative sources.\n- The government has been working to improve water and sanitation services, with a focus on upgrading existing infrastructure and expanding access to rural areas.\n- A new **water treatment plant** is currently under construction, which will provide improved water quality and increased capacity for the island's growing population.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile coverage is relatively good, with over 90% of the island having access to mobile services.\n- The island has a single **mobile network operator**, which provides 2G and 3G services, with plans to introduce 4G services in the near future.\n- Fiber-optic broadband is available in Jamestown and other urban areas, with plans to expand coverage to rural areas.\n- The island has a relatively low level of internet penetration, with around 23% of the population having access to the internet.\n- Postal services are provided by the **Saint Helena Post Office**, which offers a range of services including mail, parcel delivery, and money transfer.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Saint Helena Government has launched a major **infrastructure development program**, which includes investments in roads, energy, water, and telecommunications.\n- The program is funded by a combination of local and international sources, including the UK Government and the European Union.\n- A new **hospital** is currently under construction, which will provide improved healthcare services for the island's population.\n- The government has also launched a **renewable energy program**, which aims to reduce the island's reliance on diesel-powered generation and increase the use of renewable energy sources.\n- A new **tourism development project** is currently underway, which aims to improve the island's tourism infrastructure and attract more visitors to the island.",
