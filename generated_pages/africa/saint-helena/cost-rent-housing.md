[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Saint Helena is relatively small and limited, with most properties being owned by the government or private landlords. Typical lease terms are for one to two years, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Saint Helena Housing Ordinance**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Saint Helena's housing costs are relatively high due to its remote location and limited supply of properties. However, the cost of living in Saint Helena is still relatively low compared to other island territories in the Atlantic.

The housing market in Saint Helena is also influenced by the presence of the **British military** and the **Saint Helena Government**, which provide employment opportunities and housing for their personnel. This has led to a demand for rental properties, particularly in the capital city of Jamestown. However, the supply of properties is limited, and prices can be high, especially for properties in the city center. To address this issue, the government has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new residential areas and the renovation of existing properties.
