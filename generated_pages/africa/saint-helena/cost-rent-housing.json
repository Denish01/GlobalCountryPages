Typical lease terms are for one to two years, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Saint Helena Housing Ordinance**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Saint Helena's housing costs are relatively high due to its remote location and limited supply of properties. However, the cost of living in Saint Helena is still relatively low compared to other island territories in the Atlantic.\n\nThe housing market in Saint Helena is also influenced by the presence of the **British military** and the **Saint Helena Government**, which provide employment opportunities and housing for their personnel. This has led to a demand for rental properties, particularly in the capital city of Jamestown. However, the supply of properties is limited, and prices can be high, especially for properties in the city center. To address this issue, the government has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new residential areas and the renovation of existing properties.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $500-$700 | $300-$500 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $400-$700 | Fully furnished, **self-catering** |\n| 2 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $600-$1,000 | Family-friendly, **sea views** |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,500 | $800-$1,200 | Spacious, **garden** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$2,500 | Prime locations, **historic buildings** |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | Residential areas, **modern amenities** |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | **Countryside** views, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Half Tree Hollow: $600-$1,000 per month, a popular residential area with **sea views** and modern amenities\n- Jamestown: $800-$1,200 per month, the capital city with **historic buildings** and a range of amenities\n- Longwood: $500-$900 per month, a rural area with **countryside** views and a relaxed atmosphere\n- Alarm Forest: $400-$700 per month, a residential area with **woodland** views and a range of amenities\n- Saint Paul's: $500-$900 per month, a rural area with **sea views** and a relaxed atmosphere\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Saint Helena [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and **compare prices** to find the best deals\n- Work with a **reputable agent** to find a property that meets your needs\n- **Inspect the property** carefully before signing a lease\n- **Negotiate the rent** and terms of the lease if possible\n- Be aware of **scams** and **fake listings**, and always verify the identity of the landlord or agent\n- Check if **utilities** such as water and electricity are included in the rent, and **furnished** or **unfurnished** options are available",
