The urban-rural divide is significant, with **Jamestown** and other urban areas having more reliable and faster internet connections compared to rural areas. However, overall, the internet quality is sufficient for basic tasks such as browsing, emailing, and social media, but may not be ideal for heavy online activities like streaming or online gaming. The reliability of the internet connection can also be affected by weather conditions and infrastructure limitations.\n\nDespite these limitations, the internet has become an essential tool for the local community, and efforts have been made to improve the infrastructure and expand coverage. However, the remote location of the island and its small population make it a challenging and costly endeavor to provide high-speed and widespread internet access. As a result, visitors and residents alike need to be prepared for occasional outages and slow speeds, especially during peak usage hours.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Saint Helena, visitors can purchase one from the main carriers, **Sure** or **Cable & Wireless**, at their offices in Jamestown or at some local shops. A valid passport and proof of address may be required to purchase a SIM card, and the cost is around 20 USD for a tourist SIM. The recommended carriers offer a range of data plans, including prepaid and postpaid options, and visitors can choose the one that best suits their needs. It is also possible to purchase a SIM card with a data plan that includes international roaming, which can be useful for those who need to stay connected with family and friends back home.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sure | Prepaid | 1 GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Cable & Wireless | Postpaid | 5 GB | 30 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Sure | Data-only | 10 GB | 50 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Cable & Wireless | International Roaming | 1 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi is generally available, but the quality can vary depending on the location and infrastructure, with some hotels offering faster and more reliable connections than others.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not well-established in Saint Helena, and visitors may not find many cafes with free WiFi.\n- Coworking spaces are limited, and visitors may need to rely on hotel lobbies or other public areas to work.\n- Public WiFi is not widely available, and visitors may need to purchase a SIM card or rely on their hotel's WiFi connection.\n- Some restaurants and bars may offer free WiFi, but the speed and reliability can be unpredictable.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are limited, but some hotels and guesthouses offer shared workspaces with reliable internet connections.\n- Reliable cafe chains are not available, and remote workers may need to rely on local cafes or restaurants with WiFi.\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots or satellite internet, may be necessary for remote workers who require a reliable and fast connection.\n- VPN needs may be necessary for remote workers who need to access certain websites or services that are blocked in Saint Helena.\n- Some hotels and guesthouses offer **dedicated workspaces** with reliable internet connections, which can be a good option for remote workers.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a significant issue in Saint Helena, but some websites may be blocked due to local regulations or infrastructure limitations.\n- Blocked sites may include certain social media platforms or online services that are not available in the territory.\n- VPN recommendations include using a reputable VPN provider to access blocked websites and protect online privacy.\n- Roaming alternatives, such as purchasing a local SIM card, can be more cost-effective than relying on international roaming.\n- eSIM options are not widely available, and visitors may need to purchase a physical SIM card to stay connected.\n- Visitors should be aware of their data usage and avoid excessive roaming charges by purchasing a local SIM card or using a prepaid data plan.",
