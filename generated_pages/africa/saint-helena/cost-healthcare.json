The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, but it often has longer wait times and limited specialized care. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer more prompt attention and a wider range of specialized services, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary option, while foreigners and expats often opt for private healthcare due to the higher quality of care and shorter wait times. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have health insurance to cover the cost of private healthcare services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Saint Helena is managed by the Saint Helena National Health Service (NHS), which provides a range of healthcare services, including primary care, secondary care, and some specialized services. However, due to the island's remote location and limited resources, some specialized services may not be available, and patients may need to be referred to other countries, such as the UK, for further treatment. In such cases, having health insurance can help cover the cost of medical evacuation and treatment abroad.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics offer free consultations, but private clinics charge a fee |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Limited specialist services available on the island |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Private dental clinics offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics offer basic eye exams, while private clinics offer more comprehensive services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Public clinics offer basic blood tests, while private clinics offer more comprehensive tests |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public hospital offers emergency services, while private clinics offer more specialized care |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Public hospital offers basic accommodations, while private clinics offer more comfortable rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | Limited surgical services available on the island |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Public hospital offers basic maternity services, while private clinics offer more comprehensive care |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Limited availability of MRI scans on the island |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public clinics offer basic X-ray services, while private clinics offer more comprehensive imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers more comprehensive medical services, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical services, including medical evacuation and treatment abroad |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, are available at public clinics and private pharmacies, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 per prescription.\n- Prescription rules are similar to those in the UK, with some medications requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Pharmacy availability is limited, with only a few pharmacies on the island, but most medications can be imported from the UK or other countries.\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as cold and flu medications, are available at pharmacies and some shops, with prices ranging from $5 to $10 per packet.\n- Some medications, such as insulin and other specialized medications, may need to be imported from other countries, which can increase costs.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, patients should call the emergency number, 999, which will connect them to the public hospital's emergency services.
