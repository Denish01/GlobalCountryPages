Road Network: 118 km, moderate quality with some unpaved sections
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 1
Major Ports: 1
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Helena's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other small island territories, with a strong emphasis on providing essential services to its population. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the island's road network, improving access to electricity and water, and expanding telecommunications services. However, there is still a noticeable urban-rural gap, with Jamestown and other urban areas generally having better access to services than rural areas. The Saint Helena Government has been working to address these disparities through targeted investments and development projects.

The island's remote location and limited resources pose significant challenges to infrastructure development, with high transportation costs and limited access to specialized expertise and equipment. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant progress in recent years, with the completion of several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of a new wharf and the upgrade of the island's airport.

Saint Helena's infrastructure development is also influenced by its status as a British Overseas Territory, with the UK providing significant funding and technical support for infrastructure projects. This support has been instrumental in helping the island to develop its infrastructure and improve access to basic services.
