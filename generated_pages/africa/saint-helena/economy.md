[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Helena's economy is classified as a Lower-Middle income economy, with a relatively small and isolated market. The island's development level is limited by its remote location, lack of natural resources, and limited infrastructure. The economy has historically been driven by the public sector, with the UK government providing significant financial support. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards diversification and sustainable development, with a focus on tourism, fishing, and entrepreneurship. The island's economy is also heavily reliant on imports, with the majority of goods being shipped from the UK or other countries.

The island's economic trajectory is expected to be shaped by its strategic location in the South Atlantic, with potential opportunities for growth in areas such as tourism, fishing, and logistics. However, the economy also faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled labor, limited infrastructure, and vulnerability to external shocks. The Saint Helena government is working to address these challenges through a range of initiatives, including investment in education and training, infrastructure development, and support for entrepreneurship and innovation.

The economy of Saint Helena is also influenced by its relationship with the UK, which provides significant financial support and guidance. The island is working to develop its own economic institutions and capacity, with the aim of reducing its dependence on UK funding and achieving greater economic self-sufficiency. This will require careful planning and management, as well as a commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection.
