The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and private vehicles. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with a reliable bus service connecting the capital Jamestown to other parts of the island. Most people get around the island using taxis or private vehicles, as the bus service can be limited, especially in the evenings and on weekends.\n\nThe island's rugged terrain and limited road network mean that transportation options can be limited, especially in rural areas. However, the scenic views and picturesque landscapes make traveling around the island a pleasure. The Saint Helena Government has invested in improving the road network and public transportation system, making it easier for residents and visitors to get around the island.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-$2 | $20-$30 | Good coverage of Jamestown and surrounding areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly connecting Jamestown to outlying areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$20 | Available in Jamestown and surrounding areas |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To Jamestown, depending on traffic and time of day |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.40 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, manual transmission |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking available in Jamestown |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mainly connecting Jamestown to outlying areas |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available, Saint Helena has no domestic flights |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using the bus service or sharing a taxi with other passengers.\n- Always negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before starting your journey.\n- Be aware of the limited parking options in Jamestown and plan your trip accordingly.\n- Consider renting a car for the day to explore the island, but be aware of the limited road network and rugged terrain.\n- Use the **Saint Helena Government** website to plan your trip and get the latest information on transportation options and schedules.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.",
