[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Saint Helena is based on a mix of public and private services, with the government providing essential healthcare to all residents. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and patient contributions. While the quality of care is generally good, the range of services available is limited, and specialized treatments often require medical evacuation to the UK or other countries. Urban areas, such as Jamestown, have better access to healthcare facilities and services compared to rural areas, where healthcare options are more limited.

The public healthcare system in Saint Helena is overseen by the Health Directorate, which is responsible for providing healthcare services, regulating healthcare professionals, and enforcing healthcare policies. Despite the challenges posed by the island's remote location, the healthcare system in Saint Helena has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in infrastructure, staffing, and equipment. However, the system still faces challenges, including a shortage of specialized healthcare professionals and limited access to advanced medical technologies.

The government of Saint Helena has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare services, including the development of a new hospital, the expansion of community health services, and the introduction of health promotion programs. These initiatives aim to improve the overall health and well-being of the population, reduce health inequalities, and enhance the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.
