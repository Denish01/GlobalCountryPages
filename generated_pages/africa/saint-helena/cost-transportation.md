[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Helena is a small island territory with limited transportation options. The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and private vehicles. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with a reliable bus service connecting the capital Jamestown to other parts of the island. Most people get around the island using taxis or private vehicles, as the bus service can be limited, especially in the evenings and on weekends.

The island's rugged terrain and limited road network mean that transportation options can be limited, especially in rural areas. However, the scenic views and picturesque landscapes make traveling around the island a pleasure. The Saint Helena Government has invested in improving the road network and public transportation system, making it easier for residents and visitors to get around the island.
