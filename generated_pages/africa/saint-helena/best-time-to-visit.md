[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Helena is a tropical island in the South Atlantic Ocean, with a subtropical climate. The island experiences a dry season from May to October and a wet season from November to April. The dry season is characterized by mild temperatures, low humidity, and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit the island. The wet season, on the other hand, is marked by heavy rainfall, high humidity, and a higher risk of cyclones. The climate on Saint Helena is influenced by its location in the South Atlantic, with the trade winds bringing warm, moist air from the equator.

The dry season is the peak tourist season, with most visitors arriving between June and August. This is the best time for outdoor activities such as hiking, diving, and snorkeling, as the weather is calm and sunny. The wet season, while not ideal for outdoor activities, can be a good time for nature lovers, as the island's flora and fauna are in full bloom. However, the risk of cyclones and heavy rainfall can make travel difficult, and some tourist facilities may be closed.

The climate on Saint Helena can vary depending on the elevation and location. The coastal areas tend to be warmer and more humid than the interior, which can be cooler and more temperate. The highest point on the island, Diana's Peak, can be quite cool, especially in the evenings, and may require warmer clothing.
