The island's history as a British territory, a stopover for ships traveling between Europe and Asia, and a place of exile for notable figures like Napoleon Bonaparte, has contributed to its distinct cultural makeup. The population is predominantly of African, European, and Asian descent, with English being the primary language spoken. The island's remote location has also preserved many of its traditional customs and practices, making it a fascinating cultural destination.
