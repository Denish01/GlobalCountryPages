[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Helena has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from certain countries eligible for visa-free access or able to obtain a visa on arrival. The territory allows visa-free access to citizens of the United Kingdom, as well as some other countries, for stays of up to 183 days. However, this policy is subject to change, and it is essential to check with the relevant authorities for the most up-to-date information. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development in the territory.

The Ordinance also provides for the granting of visas, residence permits, and other forms of immigration permission. The Saint Helena Government is responsible for administering the Ordinance and ensuring that the territory's immigration rules are enforced.
