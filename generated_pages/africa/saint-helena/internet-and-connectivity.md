[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Saint Helena is provided by a limited number of carriers, resulting in moderate network coverage and average internet speeds of around 5 Mbps download. The urban-rural divide is significant, with **Jamestown** and other urban areas having more reliable and faster internet connections compared to rural areas. However, overall, the internet quality is sufficient for basic tasks such as browsing, emailing, and social media, but may not be ideal for heavy online activities like streaming or online gaming. The reliability of the internet connection can also be affected by weather conditions and infrastructure limitations.

Despite these limitations, the internet has become an essential tool for the local community, and efforts have been made to improve the infrastructure and expand coverage. However, the remote location of the island and its small population make it a challenging and costly endeavor to provide high-speed and widespread internet access. As a result, visitors and residents alike need to be prepared for occasional outages and slow speeds, especially during peak usage hours.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Saint Helena, visitors can purchase one from the main carriers, **Sure** or **Cable & Wireless**, at their offices in Jamestown or at some local shops. A valid passport and proof of address may be required to purchase a SIM card, and the cost is around 20 USD for a tourist SIM. The recommended carriers offer a range of data plans, including prepaid and postpaid options, and visitors can choose the one that best suits their needs. It is also possible to purchase a SIM card with a data plan that includes international roaming, which can be useful for those who need to stay connected with family and friends back home.
