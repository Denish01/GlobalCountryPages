[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Helena's healthcare system is a mix of public and private facilities, with the public system being the primary provider of healthcare services to the local population. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, but it often has longer wait times and limited specialized care. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer more prompt attention and a wider range of specialized services, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary option, while foreigners and expats often opt for private healthcare due to the higher quality of care and shorter wait times. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have health insurance to cover the cost of private healthcare services.

The healthcare system in Saint Helena is managed by the Saint Helena National Health Service (NHS), which provides a range of healthcare services, including primary care, secondary care, and some specialized services. However, due to the island's remote location and limited resources, some specialized services may not be available, and patients may need to be referred to other countries, such as the UK, for further treatment. In such cases, having health insurance can help cover the cost of medical evacuation and treatment abroad.
