[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Saint Helena is a remote island in the South Atlantic Ocean, and the main way to get there is by flying into Saint Helena Airport, which is located about 6 miles southwest of Jamestown, the capital. The airport receives flights from Johannesburg in South Africa and Ascension Island, with connections to the United Kingdom and other destinations. There are no direct flights from major hubs, so be prepared for a journey with multiple connections. 

The airport is relatively small, with limited facilities, but it provides a vital link to the outside world for the island's residents and visitors. If you're planning to visit Saint Helena, it's essential to book your flights well in advance, especially during peak travel seasons. Additionally, there is a shipping service that connects Saint Helena to Cape Town in South Africa and Ascension Island, but this is not a common way for tourists to arrive, as the journey can take several days.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
There are no domestic flights within Saint Helena, as the territory is relatively small and has no other airports besides the international airport. However, there are helicopter services available for charter, which can be a convenient way to see the island from the air or access remote areas. These services are typically expensive and need to be booked in advance.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in Saint Helena, so train travel is not an option. The island's terrain and small size make it unsuitable for a rail system, and the primary modes of transportation are road and sea.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There is a public bus service in Saint Helena, which operates on a limited schedule and connects Jamestown to other parts of the island. The buses are not very frequent, and the service is mainly geared towards locals, but tourists can also use them to get around. The fares are relatively cheap, but the buses can be crowded, especially during peak hours.
