[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
South Sudan has been plagued by conflict, political instability, and economic hardship, which have significantly impacted the safety and security of the country. The ongoing violence and clashes between rival groups have resulted in a high risk of crime, including armed robbery, carjacking, and kidnapping. Additionally, the lack of infrastructure and basic services, such as healthcare and sanitation, poses significant health risks to travelers. The country's remote and hard-to-reach areas are particularly vulnerable to banditry and lawlessness, making it essential for travelers to stay informed and exercise extreme caution.

Despite the challenges, South Sudan is a country with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty, with the Nile River and the Sudd wetlands being major attractions. However, the current situation requires travelers to be extremely cautious and flexible, as the security situation can change rapidly. It is crucial for travelers to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and follow the advice of local authorities and their government's travel advisory. Travelers should also be aware of the risks associated with traveling in a country with limited infrastructure and resources, including the potential for medical emergencies and the lack of access to basic services.
