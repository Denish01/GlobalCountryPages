[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main point of entry into South Sudan is Juba International Airport, which receives flights from neighboring countries such as Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. There are also direct flights from major hubs like Dubai and Cairo. If you're traveling overland, you can enter South Sudan from Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, or the Central African Republic. However, overland travel can be challenging due to the lack of infrastructure and security concerns. It's essential to research and plan carefully before attempting to enter the country by land.

Juba International Airport is the primary hub for international flights, and it's also a connection point for domestic flights to other parts of the country. The airport is relatively small, and facilities are limited, but it's being expanded and upgraded to improve services. If you're planning to travel to South Sudan, it's crucial to check the latest travel advisories and requirements, such as visa regulations and health certifications, before your trip.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in South Sudan are limited, but they're a convenient way to travel long distances in a relatively short time. The main domestic airlines are **South Supreme Airlines**, **Golden Wings Aviation**, and **Sky Travel and Aviation**. These airlines operate flights from Juba to other major towns like Wau, Malakal, and Rumbek. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, and it's recommended to work with a local travel agent or tour operator to arrange your flights. The cost of domestic flights can vary depending on the route and airline, but you can expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
South Sudan does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. The country's infrastructure is still developing, and the focus has been on building roads and improving air travel. However, there are plans to develop a rail network in the future, which could potentially connect South Sudan to neighboring countries and improve trade and transportation links.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Bus travel is a popular way to get around South Sudan, especially for shorter distances. There are several bus companies that operate intercity routes, including ** Nile Coach** and **Gateway Bus Service**. The buses are often crowded and not always comfortable, but they're a affordable way to travel. The quality of the buses and roads can vary greatly, and journeys can be slow due to the poor road conditions. The cost of bus travel is relatively low, with fares starting from around $10-$20 for a one-way ticket.
