  "content": "The cost of healthcare in South Sudan can vary significantly depending on the type of care and whether you choose public or private facilities, with the World Bank reporting a health expenditure per capita of $73 in 2023.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $73 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 27.1% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 777\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: SSP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSouth Sudan has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available. However, the quality of care can vary significantly between the two. Public healthcare facilities are generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment. In contrast, private facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it may choose to use private facilities. Insurance is not required, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical care can be expensive and the quality of care can vary significantly.\n\nThe healthcare system in South Sudan is also heavily reliant on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international aid. Many NGOs provide healthcare services, particularly in rural areas where the government's presence is limited. However, the system is often fragmented, and coordination between different providers can be a challenge. For foreigners, it is essential to research and find a reputable healthcare provider, as the quality of care can vary significantly. Many private hospitals and clinics cater specifically to foreigners and offer a higher standard of care, but at a higher cost.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have long wait times and limited resources |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private clinics may have more specialized equipment and trained staff |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private dental clinics may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private labs may offer more comprehensive testing options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Private clinics may have more experienced surgeons and better equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$300 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may have more advanced imaging equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers more comprehensive services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical evacuation and repatriation, as well as comprehensive medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-$10 per prescription\n- Prescription rules are often limited, and many medications are available over-the-counter\n- Pharmacy availability can be limited, especially in rural areas\n- Over-the-counter medications are often available at local markets and shops\n- Some pharmacies may offer more comprehensive services, including **vaccinations** and **health screenings**\n- It is essential to research and find a reputable pharmacy, as the quality of medications can vary significantly\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek care immediately.
