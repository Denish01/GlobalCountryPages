  "content": "South Sudan is generally more expensive than Sudan, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nSouth Sudan GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,444\nSudan GDP per Capita (PPP): 4,580\nSouth Sudan Inflation Rate: 36.8%\nSudan Inflation Rate: 50.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Sudan\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: South Sudan vs Sudan [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in South Sudan and Sudan varies significantly due to differences in economic conditions, political stability, and access to resources. South Sudan, being one of the world's youngest countries, faces numerous challenges, including a fragile economy, limited infrastructure, and high inflation rates. As a result, the cost of living in South Sudan is relatively high, particularly in the capital city of Juba. In contrast, Sudan has a more established economy, with a larger population and more developed infrastructure, which contributes to a lower overall cost of living.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. South Sudan's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which has led to a volatile economy susceptible to fluctuations in global oil prices. In contrast, Sudan has a more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector and a growing manufacturing industry. This diversification has helped Sudan maintain a more stable economy, which in turn has kept the cost of living relatively low. Overall, Sudan is generally cheaper than South Sudan, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | South Sudan (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 60% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 300 | 66.7% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 1,000 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | South Sudan (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 50% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 150 | 100 | 50% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 66.7% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1.5 | 33.3% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | South Sudan (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 15 | 33.3% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.5 | 1 | 50% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1 | 20% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | South Sudan (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 80 | 25% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 66.7% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 33.3% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | South Sudan (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 600 | 25% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 900 | 25% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,500 | 25% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **South Sudan is cheaper for:**\n- High-end **accommodation** options, which are scarce in Sudan\n- **International flights**, with Juba International Airport offering more connections to European and Asian destinations\n- **Luxury goods**, which are often imported from neighboring countries and can be found in high-end stores in Juba\n- **High-end dining**, with a few top-tier restaurants in Juba offering international cuisine\n- **Sudan is cheaper for:**\n- **Basic necessities**, such as food, transportation, and utilities\n- **Mid-range accommodation**, with a wider range of options available in Khartoum and other cities\n- **Local transportation**, with a well-developed public transportation system in Sudan\n- **Traditional goods**, such as handicrafts and local textiles, which can be found at affordable prices in Sudanese markets\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between South Sudan and Sudan, the decision ultimately depends on individual priorities and lifestyle.
