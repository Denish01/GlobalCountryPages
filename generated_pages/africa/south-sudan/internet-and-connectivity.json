  "content": "The internet in South Sudan is generally slow and unreliable, but it is possible to get a decent connection in major cities like Juba, with several mobile carriers offering SIM cards and data plans for tourists and locals alike.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 2 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Zain, MTN, Sudani\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in South Sudan is still in its developing stages, with a significant urban-rural divide in terms of accessibility and quality. In major cities like Juba, the capital, internet speeds are generally faster and more reliable, but they can still be slow and patchy at times. In rural areas, internet access is often limited or non-existent, making it difficult for people to stay connected with the rest of the world. The reliability of the internet in South Sudan is also a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions to service, especially during periods of conflict or political instability.\n\nDespite these challenges, the internet has the potential to play a major role in South Sudan's development, particularly in areas like education, healthcare, and commerce. The government has made efforts to improve internet infrastructure, including the launch of new fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile network coverage. However, much work remains to be done to bring the internet to all parts of the country and to ensure that it is fast, reliable, and affordable for all.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in South Sudan, tourists and visitors can purchase one from a mobile carrier's store or from a street vendor. The main carriers, such as Zain, MTN, and Sudani, offer a range of SIM cards and data plans, including prepaid and postpaid options. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide some form of identification, such as a passport, and register your details with the carrier. The cost of a SIM card is around 10 USD, and data plans start from around 5 USD per month for a basic package.\n\nIt is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, such as Zain or MTN, as they offer better coverage and quality of service. You can buy a SIM card at the airport, or at a carrier's store in Juba or other major towns. It is also a good idea to ask about the different data plans and packages available, as well as any promotions or discounts that may be on offer.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Zain | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 10 | Valid for 30 days |\n| MTN | Prepaid Plan | 2 GB | 15 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Sudani | Data Plan | 500 MB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Vivacell | Tourist Plan | 3 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi is generally available in major hotels in Juba and other towns, but the quality can be slow and unreliable.\n- Cafe WiFi is not common in South Sudan, but some cafes in Juba may offer WiFi to customers.\n- Coworking spaces are rare in South Sudan, but some organizations and NGOs may offer shared office space with WiFi.\n- Public WiFi is not widely available in South Sudan, but some internet cafes and restaurants may offer WiFi to customers.\n- Universities and colleges may offer WiFi to students and staff, but the quality can be slow and unreliable.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are limited in South Sudan, but some organizations and NGOs may offer shared office space with WiFi and other amenities.\n- Reliable cafe chains are not common in South Sudan, but some cafes in Juba may offer a decent internet connection.\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots or satellite internet, may be necessary for remote workers, especially in rural areas.\n- VPNs are recommended for remote workers, as they can help to protect against cyber threats and ensure secure access to sensitive data.\n- Some hotels and guesthouses may offer a reliable internet connection, but it is always a good idea to check the quality of the connection before booking.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in South Sudan, with some websites and social media platforms blocked by the government.\n- **VPN** use is recommended to protect against cyber threats and ensure secure access to sensitive data.\n- Roaming alternatives, such as purchasing a local SIM card or using a mobile hotspot, may be more cost-effective than relying on international roaming.\n- eSIM options are not widely available in South Sudan, but some carriers may offer eSIM plans for tourists and visitors.\n- It is always a good idea to check the quality of the internet connection before booking a hotel or guesthouse, especially if you plan to work remotely.\n- Power outages are common in South Sudan, so it is a good idea to have a backup power source, such as a portable charger or a generator, to stay connected.",
