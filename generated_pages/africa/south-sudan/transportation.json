  "content": "To get around in South Sudan, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and private cars, although the transportation infrastructure is still developing and can be challenging due to the country's vast size and limited road network.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Juba International Airport (JUB)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe main point of entry into South Sudan is Juba International Airport, which receives flights from neighboring countries such as Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. There are also direct flights from major hubs like Dubai and Cairo. If you're traveling overland, you can enter South Sudan from Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, or the Central African Republic. However, overland travel can be challenging due to the lack of infrastructure and security concerns. It's essential to research and plan carefully before attempting to enter the country by land.\n\nJuba International Airport is the primary hub for international flights, and it's also a connection point for domestic flights to other parts of the country. The airport is relatively small, and facilities are limited, but it's being expanded and upgraded to improve services. If you're planning to travel to South Sudan, it's crucial to check the latest travel advisories and requirements, such as visa regulations and health certifications, before your trip.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic flights in South Sudan are limited, but they're a convenient way to travel long distances in a relatively short time. The main domestic airlines are **South Supreme Airlines**, **Golden Wings Aviation**, and **Sky Travel and Aviation**. These airlines operate flights from Juba to other major towns like Wau, Malakal, and Rumbek. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, and it's recommended to work with a local travel agent or tour operator to arrange your flights. The cost of domestic flights can vary depending on the route and airline, but you can expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nSouth Sudan does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. The country's infrastructure is still developing, and the focus has been on building roads and improving air travel. However, there are plans to develop a rail network in the future, which could potentially connect South Sudan to neighboring countries and improve trade and transportation links.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nBus travel is a popular way to get around South Sudan, especially for shorter distances. There are several bus companies that operate intercity routes, including ** Nile Coach** and **Gateway Bus Service**. The buses are often crowded and not always comfortable, but they're a affordable way to travel. The quality of the buses and roads can vary greatly, and journeys can be slow due to the poor road conditions. The cost of bus travel is relatively low, with fares starting from around $10-$20 for a one-way ticket.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Juba, Wau, Malakal | $1-$2 | Limited routes and frequencies |\n| Taxi | Juba, Wau, Malakal | $5-$10/km | Metered taxis are not always available |\n| Ride-Hailing | Juba | $5-$10 | Local alternatives like **Boda Boda** and **Taxi 24/7** |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Juba, Wau | $2-$5 | Not always available, but can be a cheap option |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in South Sudan, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country or an international driver's license.\n- The road conditions in South Sudan are generally poor, with many roads being unpaved and prone to flooding during the rainy season.\n- Fuel costs can be high, and fuel shortages are common, so it's essential to plan your route and fuel stops carefully.\n- Car rental options are limited, but you can hire a vehicle with a driver through a local tour operator or rental company.\n- Driving in South Sudan can be hazardous due to the lack of road signs, poor road conditions, and the presence of wild animals on the roads.\n- It's recommended to drive with a local guide or driver who knows the roads and conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep valuables secure, especially in crowded areas like bus stations and markets.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing services, and always agree on the fare before you start your journey.\n- Avoid traveling at night, especially on rural roads, due to the risk of accidents and banditry.\n- Keep your vehicle doors and windows locked, and be cautious of strangers approaching your vehicle.\n- Download local apps like **Boda Boda** and **Taxi 24/7** to help you get around Juba and other major towns.\n- Learn some basic phrases in the local language, such as **\"Jambo\"** (hello) and **\"Webale\"** (thank you), to help you communicate with locals.\n- Respect local customs and traditions, especially in rural areas, and dress modestly to avoid offending local sensibilities.\n- Stay informed about local events and festivals, which can affect transportation and travel plans.",
