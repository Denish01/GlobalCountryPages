[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
South Sudan is one of the most expensive countries in Africa, with a high cost of living due to its landlocked location, limited infrastructure, and high demand for imported goods. The GDP per capita (PPP) of $1,420 (2021 est.) provides a rough anchor for estimating living costs, but the reality is that prices are significantly higher due to the country's unique challenges. A budget of $800 per month would be very challenging, covering only the most basic necessities, while a mid-range budget of $1,500 per month would provide a more comfortable lifestyle, including some luxuries like eating out and using taxis. A comfortable lifestyle, on the other hand, would require around $2,500 per month, allowing for a high level of comfort, including a nice apartment, frequent travel, and private healthcare.

Compared to neighboring countries, South Sudan is more expensive than Sudan, Kenya, and Uganda, but slightly cheaper than the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, the cost of living in South Sudan can vary greatly depending on the location, with Juba being the most expensive city, followed by other major towns like Malakal and Wau. The high inflation rate of 91.4% (2024) also means that prices are rising rapidly, making it essential to budget carefully and plan for future expenses.
