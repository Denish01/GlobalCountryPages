[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of South Sudan has been growing rapidly, with a high total fertility rate and a relatively young population. The country has a large youth population, with approximately 40% of the population under the age of 15. Urbanization is also on the rise, with many people moving to cities such as Juba, the capital, in search of better economic opportunities. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including limited access to healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The population growth rate is expected to remain high, driven by a combination of factors including high fertility rates and improving healthcare.

The population of South Sudan is also highly mobile, with many people moving within the country or across international borders in search of food, shelter, and safety. This has been driven in part by the country's history of conflict and instability, which has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. The government and international organizations are working to provide support and assistance to these displaced populations, but the challenge remains significant.

South Sudan's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in Africa, but its growth rate is among the highest in the region. The country's population is projected to continue growing rapidly, with significant implications for the country's economy, infrastructure, and social services. The government will need to invest in education, healthcare, and other sectors to meet the needs of its growing population and to ensure that the country can develop and prosper in the long term.
