The tax system in South Sudan is governed by the **Taxation Act of 2009**, which outlines the various taxes applicable in the country, including income tax, corporate tax, and value-added tax. The Act also provides for the establishment of the **National Revenue Authority**, which is responsible for the administration and collection of taxes in South Sudan. The Authority is also responsible for providing guidance and support to taxpayers, as well as enforcing tax compliance.
