[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
South Sudan has a limited public transportation system, with most people relying on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Juba, the capital, having a slightly more developed system than other urban areas. In rural areas, transportation options are scarce, and many people walk or use **bicycle taxis**. The lack of infrastructure and high inflation rate of 91.4% make transportation costs volatile and subject to change.

The main transportation modes in South Sudan are **road-based**, with a network of roads connecting major cities and towns. However, many of these roads are in poor condition, especially during the rainy season, which can make travel difficult and expensive. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the transportation network, with plans to upgrade roads and introduce new public transportation systems.
