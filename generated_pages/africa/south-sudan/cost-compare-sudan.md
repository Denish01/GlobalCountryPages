[SECTION] Overview: South Sudan vs Sudan [/SECTION]
The cost of living in South Sudan and Sudan varies significantly due to differences in economic conditions, political stability, and access to resources. South Sudan, being one of the world's youngest countries, faces numerous challenges, including a fragile economy, limited infrastructure, and high inflation rates. As a result, the cost of living in South Sudan is relatively high, particularly in the capital city of Juba. In contrast, Sudan has a more established economy, with a larger population and more developed infrastructure, which contributes to a lower overall cost of living.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. South Sudan's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which has led to a volatile economy susceptible to fluctuations in global oil prices. In contrast, Sudan has a more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector and a growing manufacturing industry. This diversification has helped Sudan maintain a more stable economy, which in turn has kept the cost of living relatively low. Overall, Sudan is generally cheaper than South Sudan, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.
