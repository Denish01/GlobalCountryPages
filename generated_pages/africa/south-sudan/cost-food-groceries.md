[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in South Sudan are generally higher than the regional average, driven up by the country's landlocked location, lack of infrastructure, and reliance on imports. The high **inflation rate** of 91.4% in 2024 has also contributed to the increasing cost of living, making it challenging for locals and expats alike to afford basic necessities. Eating out is not a common practice in South Sudan, and most people prefer to cook at home, where they can buy ingredients at local markets or supermarkets. However, for those who do eat out, there are a few mid-range restaurants in the capital city of Juba that serve a mix of local and international cuisine.

The cost of food in South Sudan can fluctuate depending on the season, with prices tend to be higher during the dry season when imports are more expensive. Additionally, the lack of a well-developed agricultural sector means that the country relies heavily on imports, which can be affected by global market trends and trade agreements. As a result, prices can vary significantly depending on the item and the location. For example, a kilogram of rice can cost anywhere from $2 to $5 USD, depending on the quality and origin.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in South Sudan can be significant, with supermarkets often charging higher prices for the same items. However, supermarkets often have a wider range of products, including imported goods, and can be a more convenient option for those who prefer to shop in a more modern environment. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more traditional shopping experience, with vendors selling fresh produce, meat, and other essentials. Bargaining is a common practice in local markets, and shoppers can often negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases.

When shopping in South Sudan, it's often a good idea to buy staples like rice, beans, and vegetables at local markets, where prices tend to be lower. However, for imported goods like milk, bread, and cheese, supermarkets may be the only option. It's also worth noting that local markets can be a great place to find unique, locally-made products, such as **handicrafts** or **traditional clothing**. In contrast, supermarkets tend to have a more limited range of local products, and often focus on imported goods.
