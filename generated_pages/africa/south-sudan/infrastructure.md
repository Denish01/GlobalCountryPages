# South Sudan Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in South Sudan is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, with limited access to electricity, poor road networks, and inadequate water and sanitation facilities, despite recent investments and development efforts.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 1% of population
Internet Penetration: 12%
Road Network: 7,000 km, poor quality
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
South Sudan's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has faced numerous challenges, including a long civil war, which has hindered infrastructure development. However, in recent years, the government has made efforts to invest in infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and energy generation. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, limited technical capacity, and security concerns. The urban areas, such as the capital Juba, have seen some improvements in infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and buildings, but the rural areas remain largely underserved.

The government has also made efforts to promote private sector investment in infrastructure, including through public-private partnerships. However, the business environment in South Sudan is still considered high-risk, which can deter investors. The country has also received support from international organizations, such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank, which have provided funding and technical assistance for infrastructure projects.

Overall, while there have been some improvements in South Sudan's infrastructure, the country still faces significant challenges in providing basic services to its population. The government will need to continue to invest in infrastructure and work to create a more favorable business environment to attract private sector investment.
