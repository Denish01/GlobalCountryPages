[SECTION] How Expensive Is South Sudan? [/SECTION]
South Sudan is one of the most expensive countries in Africa, with prices comparable to those in major Western cities. The country's economy is largely driven by oil exports, and the cost of living is inflated due to the high demand for goods and services from the oil industry. Compared to its neighbors, South Sudan is more expensive than Sudan, Ethiopia, and Uganda, but less expensive than Kenya. The high cost of living in South Sudan is also due to the country's limited infrastructure, which makes it difficult and costly to import goods.

The cost of living in South Sudan can vary greatly depending on the location, with the capital city Juba being the most expensive. The city has a high demand for housing, food, and other services, which drives up prices. Outside of Juba, the cost of living can be significantly lower, but the availability of goods and services may be limited. Overall, South Sudan is a challenging destination for travelers and expats, but with careful planning and budgeting, it is possible to have a comfortable and enjoyable experience in the country.
