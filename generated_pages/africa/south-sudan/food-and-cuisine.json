Regional variations exist, with different tribes and regions having their own unique cooking styles and specialty dishes. In the north, for example, **Kisra** is a staple food, while in the south, **Gurassa** is more commonly consumed.\n\nThe country's cuisine is also shaped by its cultural and social context, with food playing an important role in social gatherings and celebrations. In South Sudan, mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and dishes are often served in a communal style, with everyone sharing from the same plate.
