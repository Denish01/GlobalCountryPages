# Best Time to Visit South Sudan — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit South Sudan is during the dry season, from December to February, when the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for travel and outdoor activities.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit South Sudan: December to February. Peak season: December to February. Budget season: June to August. Avoid: March to May and September to November due to the heavy rainfall and high temperatures. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
South Sudan has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which lasts from December to February, is characterized by cool and dry weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius. This is the best time to visit South Sudan, as the roads are passable, and the weather is pleasant for outdoor activities such as hiking and wildlife viewing. The wet season, which lasts from March to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making it difficult to travel and engage in outdoor activities.

The country's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the southern region being generally cooler and wetter than the northern region. The **Sudd**, a vast wetland area in the southern part of the country, is particularly affected by the wet season, with flooding and waterlogging making it difficult to access. The dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for visiting the Sudd, as the water levels are lower, and the wildlife is more concentrated.

The seasons in South Sudan also affect the country's economy and daily life. During the wet season, many roads become impassable, and trade and commerce are disrupted. The dry season, on the other hand, is a time of increased economic activity, as farmers are able to plant and harvest their crops, and traders are able to transport their goods.
