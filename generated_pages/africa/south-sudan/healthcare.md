[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in South Sudan is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering services. However, the public sector is underfunded and understaffed, leading to a significant gap in the quality of care. The private sector, on the other hand, is relatively well-developed, but expensive and out of reach for most of the population. Urban areas, such as the capital Juba, have better access to healthcare facilities and services, while rural areas often lack even basic medical care. The quality of care is also a concern, with many healthcare workers lacking proper training and equipment.

The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, but it faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, infrastructure, and human resources. The country has a high burden of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, which puts a strain on the already limited healthcare resources. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system, including the construction of new hospitals and the training of healthcare workers.

The healthcare system in South Sudan is also heavily reliant on **international aid**, with many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and humanitarian agencies providing critical support to the healthcare sector. These organizations often provide essential services, such as emergency medical care, vaccinations, and disease prevention programs. However, the reliance on external aid can create sustainability challenges and limit the development of a self-sufficient healthcare system.
