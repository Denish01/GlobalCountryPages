The typical lease term is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and it is essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreement before signing. Compared to regional neighbors, South Sudan's housing costs are relatively high, due in part to the country's limited infrastructure and high inflation rate of 91.4% in 2024. The high cost of living in South Sudan, including **health expenditure per capita** of $73 in 2023, with 27.1% of health spending being out-of-pocket, can make it challenging for expats and locals alike to find affordable housing.\n\nThe housing market in South Sudan is also characterized by a shortage of quality housing, particularly in the city center. Many apartments and houses are in need of repair, and the lack of basic amenities such as electricity and water can make living conditions challenging. However, for those who are willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available. The suburbs of Juba, such as Munuki and Jebel, offer a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, at lower prices than in the city center.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $200-$400 | $100-$250 | typical quality, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $300-$600 | $150-$350 | what to expect, self-contained |\n| 2 Bedroom | $500-$1,000 | $250-$600 | family size, some amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $800-$1,500 | $400-$1,000 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $800-$2,000 | residential areas, some amenities |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | if applicable, limited infrastructure |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Munuki: a popular neighborhood for expats, with a range of housing options, including apartments and houses, rent range $200-$1,000 USD per month\n- Jebel: a quieter neighborhood, with a mix of apartments and houses, rent range $150-$800 USD per month\n- Konyo Konyo: a bustling neighborhood, with a range of housing options, including apartments and houses, rent range $100-$600 USD per month\n- Gudele: a residential neighborhood, with a mix of apartments and houses, rent range $150-$800 USD per month\n- Tongping: a neighborhood with a range of housing options, including apartments and houses, rent range $100-$600 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for South Sudan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly, considering factors such as safety, amenities, and proximity to work and services\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent, to find a suitable property and navigate the rental process\n- Be prepared to negotiate, as prices can be flexible, particularly outside of the city center\n- Inspect the property carefully, before signing a lease agreement, to ensure it is in good condition\n- Consider the **out-of-pocket health spend**, and factor in the cost of healthcare, when planning your budget\n- Be aware of scams, and never pay a deposit without seeing the property and meeting the landlord or agent in person\n- Furnished apartments are less common, than unfurnished, so be prepared to provide your own furniture and appliances",
