  "content": "The population of South Sudan is approximately 15.8 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a complex and multifaceted society.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 15.8 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 3.4%\nMedian Age: 17.4 years\nUrban Population: 20%\nPopulation Density: 25.5 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 57.3 years\nFertility Rate: 5.1 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe population of South Sudan has been growing rapidly, with a high total fertility rate and a relatively young population. The country has a large youth population, with approximately 40% of the population under the age of 15. Urbanization is also on the rise, with many people moving to cities such as Juba, the capital, in search of better economic opportunities. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including limited access to healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The population growth rate is expected to remain high, driven by a combination of factors including high fertility rates and improving healthcare.\n\nThe population of South Sudan is also highly mobile, with many people moving within the country or across international borders in search of food, shelter, and safety. This has been driven in part by the country's history of conflict and instability, which has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. The government and international organizations are working to provide support and assistance to these displaced populations, but the challenge remains significant.\n\nSouth Sudan's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in Africa, but its growth rate is among the highest in the region. The country's population is projected to continue growing rapidly, with significant implications for the country's economy, infrastructure, and social services. The government will need to invest in education, healthcare, and other sectors to meet the needs of its growing population and to ensure that the country can develop and prosper in the long term.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dinka | 35-40% | Central and Western regions | Largest ethnic group in the country |\n| Nuer | 15-20% | Eastern and Central regions | Second-largest ethnic group |\n| Bari | 10-15% | Central region | Mainly found in the Juba area |\n| Zande | 5-10% | Western region | Found in the southwestern part of the country |\n| Shilluk | 5-10% | Northern region | Mainly found in the Upper Nile state |\n| Murle | 2-5% | Eastern region | Found in the Pibor area |\n| Toposa | 2-5% | Eastern region | Found in the Kapoeta area |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity of South Sudan is one of its defining characteristics, with over 60 different ethnic groups represented in the country.
