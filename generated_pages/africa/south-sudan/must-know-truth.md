# The Truth About South Sudan - History & Real Facts

South Sudan is a complex and multifaceted country with a rich history, diverse culture, and significant challenges, often misunderstood by the international community due to a lack of accurate information and prevailing misconceptions. 

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
South Sudan has a long and complex history, with the region being inhabited by various ethnic groups for thousands of years. The country was part of the **Sudan** from 1820 to 2011, under **Egyptian** and then **British** rule, before gaining independence as a sovereign state on July 9, 2011. The path to independence was marked by two long civil wars, the first from 1955 to 1972 and the second from 1983 to 2005, which resulted in the signing of the **Comprehensive Peace Agreement** in 2005. This agreement paved the way for a referendum on independence, which was held in January 2011, with the majority of the population voting in favor of secession from Sudan.

South Sudan's independence was recognized by the international community, and it became a member of the **United Nations** in July 2011.
