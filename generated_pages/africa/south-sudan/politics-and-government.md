[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of South Sudan is designed to have a **separation of powers** among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. However, in practice, the executive branch has significant influence over the other branches. The country has a **unitary system** of government, with most power concentrated in the national government. The **president** serves as both the head of state and head of government, and is directly elected by the people. The National Legislative Assembly is the country's parliament, and is composed of two chambers: the National Assembly and the Council of States.

The political system in South Sudan is still developing, and the country has faced significant challenges in its transition from a **liberation movement** to a **democratic government**. The country's **interim constitution**, which was adopted in 2011, provides for a system of government that is based on the principles of **democracy**, **federalism**, and **human rights**. However, the implementation of these principles has been slow, and the country has faced numerous challenges, including **conflict**, **corruption**, and **poverty**.

The government of South Sudan has also faced challenges in its relations with the international community, particularly with regard to **human rights** and **governance**. The country has been subject to **sanctions** and **condemnation** from the international community, particularly with regard to its **treatment of civilians** and its **management of natural resources**. Despite these challenges, the government of South Sudan has made efforts to **reform** its institutions and to **improve** its relations with the international community.
