In general, the cost of utilities in South Sudan is subject to fluctuation due to the country's high inflation rate, which was 91.4% in 2024. This means that prices for utilities such as electricity, water, and gas can change rapidly, making it challenging for residents to budget for their utility expenses. Additionally, there can be seasonal variations in utility costs, with prices tend to be higher during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water.\n\nThe high cost of utilities in South Sudan is also driven by the lack of infrastructure and the reliance on imported fuel for electricity generation. This can lead to frequent power outages and disruptions to other utility services. Furthermore, the cost of utilities can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas such as Juba tend to have higher prices than rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the utility infrastructure and reduce costs for residents.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | Prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | Metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | Included in municipal taxes |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-$50 | 10-20 Mbps | MTN, Zain |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $75-$100 | 60-100 Mbps | MTN, Zain |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-$20 | 1-5 GB | MTN, Zain |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$50 | 5-20 GB | MTN, Zain |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-$100 | varies | MTN, Zain |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | Available in some areas |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | Available in some areas |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in South Sudan, residents typically need to visit the utility company's office and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help residents budget for their electricity expenses.\n- The best internet providers in South Sudan are MTN and Zain, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It is also a good idea to negotiate with utility providers to get the best rates, especially for large or commercial users.",
