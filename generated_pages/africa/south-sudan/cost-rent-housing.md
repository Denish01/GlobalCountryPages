[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in South Sudan is highly competitive, with a high demand for housing, particularly in the capital city of Juba. The typical lease term is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and it is essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreement before signing. Compared to regional neighbors, South Sudan's housing costs are relatively high, due in part to the country's limited infrastructure and high inflation rate of 91.4% in 2024. The high cost of living in South Sudan, including **health expenditure per capita** of $73 in 2023, with 27.1% of health spending being out-of-pocket, can make it challenging for expats and locals alike to find affordable housing.

The housing market in South Sudan is also characterized by a shortage of quality housing, particularly in the city center. Many apartments and houses are in need of repair, and the lack of basic amenities such as electricity and water can make living conditions challenging. However, for those who are willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available. The suburbs of Juba, such as Munuki and Jebel, offer a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, at lower prices than in the city center.
