[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
South Sudan has a moderate visa policy, with a limited number of countries having visa-free access or eligibility for visa on arrival. Currently, only a few nationalities, such as citizens of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, can enter South Sudan without a visa, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an electronic visa system. The country's visa stance is subject to change, and it's essential to check with the official authorities for the latest information.

The visa policy in South Sudan is designed to balance the need for security and control with the need to promote tourism, business, and cultural exchange. The government has introduced an electronic visa system to simplify the application process and reduce waiting times. However, the system is still in its early stages, and some nationalities may need to apply for a visa through the traditional paper-based system.
