The most widely spoken languages include **Dinka**, **Nuer**, **Bari**, **Zande**, and **Shilluk**, which are spoken by various ethnic groups. English is the official language and is widely used in government, education, and business, but English proficiency is generally low, particularly outside of urban areas. Regional dialects and minority languages are also prevalent, and many South Sudanese people speak multiple languages.\n\nDespite the diversity of languages, English is the primary language used in formal settings, such as government offices, schools, and businesses. However, in informal settings, such as markets and social gatherings, local languages and dialects are more commonly spoken. Visitors to South Sudan may find it challenging to communicate with locals, particularly outside of urban areas, but many South Sudanese people are eager to learn English and appreciate efforts to communicate in their language.\n\nThe use of local languages and dialects is an important part of South Sudanese culture, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in the local language are likely to be well-received. In addition to English, **Arabic** is also widely spoken, particularly in the north, due to the country's historical ties with Sudan. Overall, the linguistic landscape of South Sudan is complex and diverse, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n| English | Local Language (Dinka) | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Ci | chee | formal |\n| Hello | Duɔŋ | doh-oh-ng | informal |\n| Thank you | Yin akɔl | yin ah-koh-l | formal |\n| Please | Ba yiɛl | bah yeh-l | formal |\n| Yes / No | Ayee / Cha | ah-yay / chah | formal |\n| Excuse me | Ba yin cɔl | bah yin choh-l | formal |\n| How much? | Kɛnɛ de? | keh-neh deh | formal |\n| Where is...? | De kɛnɛ? | deh keh-neh | formal |\n| I don't understand | Miɛl acɔl | mee-eh-l ah-choh-l | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Ba yin jaŋ English? | bah yin jah-ng English | formal |\n| Help! | Ba yin cɔl! | bah yin choh-l | formal |\n| Goodbye | Nɔŋ kuɛn | noh-ng koo-eh-n | formal |\n| Sorry | Yin akɔl | yin ah-koh-l | formal |\nNote: The local language phrases are in Dinka, which is one of the most widely spoken languages in South Sudan.\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n| Number | Local Word (Dinka) | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Toŋ | toh-ng |\n| 2 | Riw | ree-oo |\n| 3 | De | deh |\n| 4 | Toŋ kuɛn | toh-ng koo-eh-n |\n| 5 | Kuɛn | koo-eh-n |\n| 6 | Toŋ kɛnɛ | toh-ng keh-neh |\n| 7 | Toŋ de kɛnɛ | toh-ng deh keh-neh |\n| 8 | Toŋ toŋ kuɛn | toh-ng toh-ng koo-eh-n |\n| 9 | Toŋ toŋ kɛnɛ | toh-ng toh-ng keh-neh |\n| 10 | Kuɛn kɛnɛ | koo-eh-n keh-neh |\n| 100 | Biɛl | bee-eh-l |\n| 1000 | Muɔɔth | moo-oh-th |\nNote: The local numbers are in Dinka, which is one of the most widely spoken languages in South Sudan.\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when communicating with locals, using formal titles and greetings.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in the local language, such as greetings and expressions of gratitude.\n- Use non-verbal communication, such as hand gestures and body language, to convey meaning.\n- Avoid using complex sentences or jargon, and speak slowly and clearly.\n- Be patient and flexible when communicating, and don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification.\n- Use a translator or interpreter if possible, particularly in formal settings.\n- Be mindful of cultural differences and nuances, and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary, particularly in rural areas where internet access may be limited.\n- Learn basic phrases and vocabulary in the local language, such as Dinka or Nuer.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites and forums, to learn more about the local language and culture.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or interpreter to help with communication and navigation.",
