  "content": "The infrastructure in South Sudan is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, with limited access to electricity, poor road networks, and inadequate water and sanitation facilities, despite recent investments and development efforts.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 1% of population\nInternet Penetration: 12%\nRoad Network: 7,000 km, poor quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSouth Sudan's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has faced numerous challenges, including a long civil war, which has hindered infrastructure development. However, in recent years, the government has made efforts to invest in infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and energy generation. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, limited technical capacity, and security concerns. The urban areas, such as the capital Juba, have seen some improvements in infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and buildings, but the rural areas remain largely underserved.\n\nThe government has also made efforts to promote private sector investment in infrastructure, including through public-private partnerships. However, the business environment in South Sudan is still considered high-risk, which can deter investors. The country has also received support from international organizations, such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank, which have provided funding and technical assistance for infrastructure projects.\n\nOverall, while there have been some improvements in South Sudan's infrastructure, the country still faces significant challenges in providing basic services to its population. The government will need to continue to invest in infrastructure and work to create a more favorable business environment to attract private sector investment.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 7,000 km | Poor | Many roads are unpaved and become impassable during the rainy season |\n| Railways | none | - | There are plans to construct a railway line, but none currently exist |\n| Airports | 3 international, 10 domestic | Moderate | The main airport in Juba is being upgraded, but others are in poor condition |\n| Ports | none | - | South Sudan is landlocked, but there are plans to construct a port on the White Nile River |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of power generation is **thermal power**, with a small amount of **hydroelectric power** also being generated.\n- The electricity grid is unreliable, with frequent **power outages** due to a lack of maintenance and funding.\n- The government has made efforts to increase access to electricity, including the construction of new power plants and transmission lines.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are being explored, but are not yet a significant contributor to the energy mix.\n- The country is also working to increase energy efficiency, including through the use of **energy-efficient appliances** and **building codes**.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is not always safe to drink, and many people rely on **rainwater collection** or **wells** for their water needs.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with many people in rural areas lacking access to **latrines** or other sanitation facilities.\n- The government has made efforts to increase access to **clean water** and **sanitation**, including through the construction of new water treatment plants and sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many people having to walk long distances to access **water sources**.\n- The country is also working to improve **wastewater management**, including through the construction of new **sewerage systems**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile phone coverage** is relatively widespread, with most of the population having access to **mobile networks**.\n- **Fiber optic cables** are being laid to increase **internet bandwidth** and improve **communication services**.\n- The government has made efforts to increase access to **information and communication technology** (ICT), including through the construction of new **telecommunication towers**.\n- **4G/5G rollout** is planned, but has been delayed due to a lack of funding and technical capacity.\n- **Postal services** are limited, with many people relying on **private courier services** for mail and package delivery.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government is working on a major **road construction project**, which will connect the capital Juba to other major towns and cities.\n- A new **power plant** is being constructed to increase the country's energy generation capacity.\n- The **Juba River Port** project is planned, which will provide a major transportation hub for the country.\n- The government is also working on a **water and sanitation project**, which will increase access to clean water and sanitation facilities in rural areas.\n- A **fiber optic cable project** is underway, which will increase internet bandwidth and improve communication services.",
