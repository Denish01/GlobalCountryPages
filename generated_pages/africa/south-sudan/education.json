Primary education is compulsory and lasts for eight years, followed by four years of secondary education. Tertiary education is provided by universities and other institutions, with a focus on fields such as **agriculture**, **medicine**, and **engineering**. The quality of education in South Sudan varies significantly, with public schools often facing challenges such as limited resources and inadequate infrastructure, while private schools tend to offer better facilities and more qualified teachers.\n\nThe public education system in South Sudan is free, but many students opt for private schools due to the perceived higher quality of education. However, private schools are often expensive and inaccessible to many students, particularly those from rural areas. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the education system, including the introduction of **free primary education** and the construction of new schools. Despite these efforts, the education system in South Sudan still faces significant challenges, including a lack of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources.\n\nThe education system in South Sudan is also affected by the country's **conflict** and **displacement**, which have led to the destruction of schools and the displacement of students and teachers.
