[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
The business environment in South Sudan is challenging due to the country's fragile economy, lack of infrastructure, and high levels of **corruption**. The government has expressed a desire to attract foreign investment, but the overall attitude towards foreign investment is often unpredictable and subject to change. The bureaucracy level is high, with multiple layers of government and regulatory bodies involved in the approval process for investments. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for investment in key sectors such as agriculture, energy, and infrastructure development.

The government has taken steps to improve the business environment, including the establishment of the **South Sudan Investment Authority**, which is responsible for promoting investment and facilitating the investment process. However, more needs to be done to address the underlying issues that hinder business growth, such as **poor infrastructure**, **limited access to finance**, and **inadequate regulatory frameworks**.

The country's **civil war** and **political instability** have also had a significant impact on the business environment, leading to a decline in economic activity and a deterioration in the overall investment climate. However, with the signing of the **Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan** in 2018, there is hope that the country can move towards a more stable and peaceful future, which would be conducive to business growth and investment.
