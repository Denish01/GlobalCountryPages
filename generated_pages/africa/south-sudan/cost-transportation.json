  "content": "The cost of transportation in South Sudan varies widely, with a monthly transit pass costing around $15-$30 USD, depending on the city and mode of transport.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($20 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($5 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.50 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (No — limited options)\nCurrency: SSP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nSouth Sudan has a limited public transportation system, with most people relying on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Juba, the capital, having a slightly more developed system than other urban areas. In rural areas, transportation options are scarce, and many people walk or use **bicycle taxis**. The lack of infrastructure and high inflation rate of 91.4% make transportation costs volatile and subject to change.\n\nThe main transportation modes in South Sudan are **road-based**, with a network of roads connecting major cities and towns. However, many of these roads are in poor condition, especially during the rainy season, which can make travel difficult and expensive. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the transportation network, with plans to upgrade roads and introduce new public transportation systems.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage, unreliable schedules |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Extensive network, variable prices |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5.00 | $1.00 | $10-$20 | Limited availability, negotiable fares |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited options, such as local services like **Mula** |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $50-$100 | Economy car, depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options, variable prices |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | Variable prices, depending on route and operator |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, such as Juba to Malakal |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are often cheaper than metered taxis.\n- When using taxis, always **negotiate the fare** before starting your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night, and avoid traveling alone in **unmarked vehicles**.\n- Download local transportation apps, such as **Mula**, to help you navigate the city and find affordable transportation options.\n- Consider hiring a **private driver** for long-distance trips, as this can be safer and more convenient than using public transportation.\n- Always **check the condition** of your vehicle before renting, as road conditions in South Sudan can be challenging.",
