[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in South Sudan is characterized by a lack of infrastructure, limited access to financing, and a largely informal economy. The market is heavily influenced by the country's turbulent political history and ongoing conflicts, which have hindered economic development and investment. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for growth, particularly in the rental market, as the country's population is expanding and there is a shortage of decent housing. The urban areas, such as Juba, are experiencing rapid growth, driven by the influx of returnees and international organizations, while rural areas remain largely underdeveloped.

The current market conditions are marked by a shortage of quality properties, particularly in urban areas, which has driven up prices and rentals. However, the prices are still relatively low compared to other African countries, making it an attractive destination for investors looking for affordable options. The price trajectory is expected to rise in the coming years, driven by increasing demand and limited supply. The government has launched initiatives to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, which is expected to boost the property market.

The urban-rural divide is significant, with urban areas offering better amenities and services, while rural areas lack basic infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, and water. The government has launched initiatives to develop rural areas, including the construction of roads and provision of basic services, which is expected to improve the quality of life and attract investment to these areas.
