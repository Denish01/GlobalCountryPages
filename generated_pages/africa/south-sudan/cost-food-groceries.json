  "content": "In South Sudan, the cost of food and groceries can be relatively high due to the country's reliance on imports and the ongoing economic instability, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant costing around $5-7 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($5-7 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($20-30 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($100-150 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($3-5 USD)\nCurrency: SSP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nFood prices in South Sudan are generally higher than the regional average, driven up by the country's landlocked location, lack of infrastructure, and reliance on imports. The high **inflation rate** of 91.4% in 2024 has also contributed to the increasing cost of living, making it challenging for locals and expats alike to afford basic necessities. Eating out is not a common practice in South Sudan, and most people prefer to cook at home, where they can buy ingredients at local markets or supermarkets. However, for those who do eat out, there are a few mid-range restaurants in the capital city of Juba that serve a mix of local and international cuisine.\n\nThe cost of food in South Sudan can fluctuate depending on the season, with prices tend to be higher during the dry season when imports are more expensive. Additionally, the lack of a well-developed agricultural sector means that the country relies heavily on imports, which can be affected by global market trends and trade agreements. As a result, prices can vary significantly depending on the item and the location. For example, a kilogram of rice can cost anywhere from $2 to $5 USD, depending on the quality and origin.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2-3 | 150-200 SSP | Imported from Uganda or Kenya |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1-2 | 100-150 SSP | Locally baked, but often in short supply |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-3 | 200-250 SSP | Imported from Uganda or Kenya |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2-5 | 200-500 SSP | Imported from Asia or Africa |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $5-7 | 500-700 SSP | Imported from Brazil or Kenya |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $8-10 | 800-1000 SSP | Imported from Kenya or Ethiopia |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-7 | 500-700 SSP | Imported from South Africa or Europe |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1-2 | 100-200 SSP | Locally grown, but often in short supply |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1-2 | 100-200 SSP | Locally grown, but often in short supply |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1-2 | 100-200 SSP | Locally grown, but often in short supply |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5-7 | 500-700 SSP | Made from cow's milk, often in short supply |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 | 100-200 SSP | Imported from Uganda or Kenya |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 | Typical dishes like **injera** or **sosatie** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-15 | One person, with a limited menu |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-30 | Three courses, with a mix of local and international cuisine |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-70 | Upscale, with a focus on international cuisine |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-5 | Brewed in South Sudan or imported from neighboring countries |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-7 | From Europe or Asia, often in short supply |\n| Cappuccino | $3-5 | In a mid-range cafe or restaurant |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | Imported from neighboring countries |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in South Sudan can be significant, with supermarkets often charging higher prices for the same items. However, supermarkets often have a wider range of products, including imported goods, and can be a more convenient option for those who prefer to shop in a more modern environment. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more traditional shopping experience, with vendors selling fresh produce, meat, and other essentials. Bargaining is a common practice in local markets, and shoppers can often negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases.\n\nWhen shopping in South Sudan, it's often a good idea to buy staples like rice, beans, and vegetables at local markets, where prices tend to be lower. However, for imported goods like milk, bread, and cheese, supermarkets may be the only option. It's also worth noting that local markets can be a great place to find unique, locally-made products, such as **handicrafts** or **traditional clothing**. In contrast, supermarkets tend to have a more limited range of local products, and often focus on imported goods.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in South Sudan is to buy ingredients at local markets and cook at home, where a meal can cost as little as $1-2 USD.\n- Local staples like **injera** (a sourdough flatbread) and **sosatie** (skewers of marinated meat) are good value and can be found at most restaurants and markets.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, which can be expensive and often in short supply.\n- Try to buy in bulk, especially for staples like rice and beans, which can be cheaper in larger quantities.\n- Be prepared to bargain, especially at local markets, where prices can be negotiable.\n- Consider shopping at local markets, which can be a great place to find unique, locally-made products and support the local economy.",
