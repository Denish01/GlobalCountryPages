[SECTION] How South Sudan Is Divided [/SECTION]
South Sudan is a federal republic divided into 10 states, which are further subdivided into counties, and then into payams and bomas. The 10 states are: Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei, Lakes, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Unity, Upper Nile, Warrap, Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Western Equatoria. Each state has its own capital and is headed by a governor. The administrative structure is designed to allow for a degree of autonomy and self-governance at the state and local levels, while also ensuring a strong central government in Juba.
