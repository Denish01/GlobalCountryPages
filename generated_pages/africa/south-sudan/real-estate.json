  "content": "The property market in South Sudan is challenging and largely undeveloped, with foreigners facing restrictions on buying, but there are opportunities for investment in the rental market and through company structures. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nCan Foreigners Buy?: Restricted\nAverage Price (Capital, per sqm): $150 USD\nRental Yield: 10%\nProperty Tax: 2%\nPopular Areas: Juba, Malakal, Wau\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]\nThe property market in South Sudan is characterized by a lack of infrastructure, limited access to financing, and a largely informal economy. The market is heavily influenced by the country's turbulent political history and ongoing conflicts, which have hindered economic development and investment. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for growth, particularly in the rental market, as the country's population is expanding and there is a shortage of decent housing. The urban areas, such as Juba, are experiencing rapid growth, driven by the influx of returnees and international organizations, while rural areas remain largely underdeveloped.\n\nThe current market conditions are marked by a shortage of quality properties, particularly in urban areas, which has driven up prices and rentals. However, the prices are still relatively low compared to other African countries, making it an attractive destination for investors looking for affordable options. The price trajectory is expected to rise in the coming years, driven by increasing demand and limited supply. The government has launched initiatives to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, which is expected to boost the property market.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is significant, with urban areas offering better amenities and services, while rural areas lack basic infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, and water. The government has launched initiatives to develop rural areas, including the construction of roads and provision of basic services, which is expected to improve the quality of life and attract investment to these areas.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Juba | 200 | 500 | Apartment |\n| Malakal | 100 | 200 | House |\n| Wau | 150 | 300 | Commercial |\n| Yambio | 80 | 150 | House |\n| Rumbek | 60 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Bor | 40 | 80 | House |\n| Yei | 50 | 120 | Commercial |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are restricted from buying property in South Sudan, except through a company structure or leasehold agreement.\n- Foreign companies can own property, but they must be registered with the relevant authorities and obtain the necessary permits.\n- Foreign individuals can lease property for a maximum period of 50 years, renewable for a further 50 years.\n- Foreigners must obtain a **residence permit** to live in South Sudan, which can be obtained through the Ministry of Interior.\n- Foreign companies must obtain a **business license** to operate in South Sudan, which can be obtained through the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
