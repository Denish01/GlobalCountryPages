[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in South Sudan is still developing, and the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location. In general, the cost of utilities in South Sudan is subject to fluctuation due to the country's high inflation rate, which was 91.4% in 2024. This means that prices for utilities such as electricity, water, and gas can change rapidly, making it challenging for residents to budget for their utility expenses. Additionally, there can be seasonal variations in utility costs, with prices tend to be higher during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water.

The high cost of utilities in South Sudan is also driven by the lack of infrastructure and the reliance on imported fuel for electricity generation. This can lead to frequent power outages and disruptions to other utility services. Furthermore, the cost of utilities can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas such as Juba tend to have higher prices than rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the utility infrastructure and reduce costs for residents.
