[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in South Sudan is still developing, with a significant gap between public and private education in terms of quality. Public schools, which are generally free or subsidized, often lack resources and qualified teachers, resulting in a lower quality of education. On the other hand, private schools, which are mostly attended by children from wealthy families, offer a higher quality of education, with better facilities and more qualified teachers. The language of instruction in South Sudan is English, and compulsory education lasts for 8 years, from primary 1 to primary 8. International schools are also available in major cities like Juba, offering a range of curricula, including the British, American, and International Baccalaureate.

The education system in South Sudan faces numerous challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, qualified teachers, and resources. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the education sector, with a focus on increasing access to education, particularly for girls and children in rural areas. The government has also introduced initiatives to improve the quality of education, including teacher training programs and the introduction of new curricula. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in education quality between public and private schools, as well as between urban and rural areas.
