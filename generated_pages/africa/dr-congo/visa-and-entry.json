[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. However, some nationalities are eligible for visa-free access or can obtain a visa on arrival. The DR Congo government has been working to improve its visa process and attract more tourists and business travelers to the country. Currently, only a few countries, such as neighboring countries and some African nations, are exempt from visa requirements.\n\nThe visa policy of DR Congo is designed to balance the need to control the flow of visitors with the need to promote tourism, trade, and investment. The country offers various types of visas, including **Tourist Visas**, **Business Visas**, **Transit Visas**, and **Diplomatic Visas**, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. Visitors can apply for a visa at the DR Congo embassy or consulate in their home country or, in some cases, obtain a visa on arrival at one of the country's international airports.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | For diplomatic and service passport holders only |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a **Tourist Visa**, which is valid for up to 30 days.
