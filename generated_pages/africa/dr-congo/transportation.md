[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has several international airports, with N'Djili Airport in Kinshasa being the main entry point for most travelers. Direct flights to Kinshasa are available from major European and African cities, including Brussels, Paris, and Johannesburg. Alternatively, you can also enter the country overland from neighboring countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania, although this can be a challenging and time-consuming process due to the poor state of the roads and border crossings. If you do plan to enter the country overland, it's essential to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations, as well as to ensure that you have all the necessary documents and visas.

For those traveling from within Africa, there are also several regional flight hubs, including Addis Ababa and Nairobi, which offer connections to Kinshasa and other major cities in the DR Congo. Additionally, you can also take a ferry or a boat from neighboring countries such as the Republic of Congo and Tanzania to reach the DR Congo. However, this option can be slow and unpredictable, and it's not recommended for most travelers.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights are available in the DR Congo, although the network is limited and often unreliable. The main domestic airlines include **Congo Airways** and **Air Kasaï**, which offer flights between major cities such as Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, and Kisangani. To book a domestic flight, you can either visit the airline's website or go to the airport in person, although it's recommended to book in advance to ensure availability. The cost of a domestic flight can vary greatly depending on the route and airline, but you can expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket. It's also worth noting that domestic flights can be subject to delays and cancellations, so it's essential to be flexible and plan accordingly.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The rail network in the DR Congo is limited and in poor condition, with only a few routes available, including the line from Kinshasa to Matadi and the line from Lubumbashi to Sakania. The trains are often slow and uncomfortable, and the schedules can be unpredictable. However, taking the train can be a unique and adventurous experience, and it's a good way to see the countryside. To book a train ticket, you can either go to the train station in person or buy a ticket from a local travel agent. The cost of a train ticket can vary depending on the route and class, but you can expect to pay around $10-$50 for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses and coaches are a popular mode of transportation in the DR Congo, with several companies operating intercity routes. The quality of the buses can vary greatly, ranging from modern and comfortable to old and overcrowded. Some of the main bus companies include **Malaika** and **Kasango**, which offer routes between major cities such as Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, and Kisangani. The cost of a bus ticket can vary depending on the route and company, but you can expect to pay around $10-$50 for a one-way ticket. It's also worth noting that bus travel can be slow and unpredictable, due to the poor state of the roads and traffic conditions.
