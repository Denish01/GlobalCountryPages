[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in DR Congo is largely unregulated, with most properties being rented out by individual landlords. Typical lease terms are usually short-term, ranging from 6-12 months, and often require a deposit equivalent to 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through informal negotiations. Compared to its regional neighbors, DR Congo's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the capital city of Kinshasa. However, the cost of living in other parts of the country can be significantly lower.

The housing market in DR Congo is also characterized by a shortage of decent and affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. This has led to the development of informal settlements and slums, where many people live in poor conditions with limited access to basic services such as water, sanitation, and healthcare. The government has implemented some initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the construction of new housing units and the rehabilitation of existing ones. However, much more needs to be done to address the scale of the problem.
