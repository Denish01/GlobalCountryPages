[SECTION] How DR Congo Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is divided into 25 provinces, which are further divided into districts, territories, and cities. The provinces are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and each has its own capital and government. The provinces are also grouped into four main regions: the western region, the eastern region, the central region, and the southern region. This division is based on geographical and cultural characteristics, and it helps to facilitate governance and development at the local level.

The administrative structure of DR Congo is complex, with multiple layers of government and administration. The provinces are responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, while the central government is responsible for national policies and programs. The provinces also have a degree of autonomy, which allows them to make decisions on local matters and to manage their own resources.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
DR Congo has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with few paved roads and limited public transportation options. However, there are domestic flights available between major cities, and buses and taxis are widely used for shorter distances. The road network is also being improved, with new roads being built and existing ones being upgraded. For visitors, it is often easiest to use private transportation or to hire a driver, as this can be more convenient and reliable than using public transportation.

In terms of specific transportation options, there are several airlines that offer domestic flights, including Congo Airways and Air Kasaï. There are also several bus companies that operate between major cities, including Mwanga and Malaika. Taxis are widely available, but it is often necessary to negotiate the fare in advance. For driving, the road conditions can be challenging, especially during the rainy season, and it is often necessary to have a 4x4 vehicle to navigate the rough terrain. [CALLOUT] It is also important to note that driving at night can be hazardous, due to the lack of street lighting and the presence of pedestrians and animals on the road.
