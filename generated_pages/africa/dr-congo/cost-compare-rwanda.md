[SECTION] Overview: DR Congo vs Rwanda [/SECTION]
The cost of living in DR Congo and Rwanda varies significantly, reflecting the different economic contexts of the two countries. DR Congo, with its large population and abundant natural resources, has a lower cost of living due to its relatively low prices for food, housing, and transportation. In contrast, Rwanda, with its smaller population and more developed economy, has a higher cost of living, driven by its focus on tourism and high-end services. Overall, DR Congo is generally cheaper than Rwanda, with a cost of living that is roughly 20-30% lower.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. DR Congo has a largely informal economy, with many people engaged in subsistence farming or small-scale trade, which keeps prices low. In contrast, Rwanda has a more formalized economy, with a strong focus on services and tourism, which drives up prices. Additionally, Rwanda's efforts to develop its infrastructure and attract foreign investment have led to an increase in prices for housing, food, and other essentials.
