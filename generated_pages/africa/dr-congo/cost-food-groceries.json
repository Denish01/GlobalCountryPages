Additionally, the country's economy has been affected by years of conflict and instability, leading to inflation and currency fluctuations that can impact the price of food and other essentials. Despite these challenges, many Congolese people rely on traditional dishes made with local ingredients such as **casava**, **plantains**, and ** peanuts**, which are often more affordable than imported foods.\n\nEating out is not as common in DR Congo as it is in some other countries, and many people prefer to cook at home using fresh ingredients from local markets. However, in urban areas like Kinshasa, there are a growing number of restaurants and cafes that cater to a range of tastes and budgets. For those who do eat out, the cost of a meal can vary widely depending on the type of establishment and the location, with street food and local eateries tend to be the most affordable options.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2-$3 | 2,500-3,500 CDF | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1-$2 | 1,500-2,500 CDF | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-$3 | 2,500-3,500 CDF | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 1,500-2,500 CDF | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 7,500-10,000 CDF | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $8-$10 | 12,000-15,000 CDF | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 7,500-10,000 CDF | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 1,500-2,500 CDF | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 1,500-2,500 CDF | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.50-$1 | 750-1,500 CDF | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 7,500-10,000 CDF | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-$2 | 1,500-2,500 CDF | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | typical dishes like **fufu** and **soupe** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | one person, 2-3 courses |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$50 | 3 courses, **grilled fish** or **meat** |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | upscale, **international cuisine** |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nIn general, prices at supermarkets in DR Congo tend to be higher than those at local markets, known as **marchés**, where fresh produce and other essentials can be found at more competitive prices. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and may be more convenient for those who prefer to shop in a more modern and organized environment. For those on a budget, local markets are often the best option, where prices can be negotiated and a wide range of fresh produce can be found at affordable prices.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's common to **bargain** and negotiate prices, especially for larger purchases. Vendors often expect customers to haggle, and prices can vary depending on the time of day, the season, and other factors. For staples like **rice**, **beans**, and **vegetables**, local markets are often the best option, while supermarkets may be more convenient for imported goods like **pasta** or **canned goods**.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eat at local markets or street food stalls for the cheapest and most authentic options\n- Try traditional dishes like **fufu** and **soupe**, which are often made with local ingredients and are very affordable\n- Buy fresh produce in season to get the best prices\n- Avoid buying imported goods, which tend to be more expensive than local alternatives\n- Consider shopping at local markets or **marchés** for the best prices on staples like **rice** and **beans**\n- For a cheap and filling meal, try a **brochette** (skewer of grilled meat) from a street vendor, which can cost as little as $1-$2 USD.",
