  "content": "The cost of healthcare in DR Congo can vary significantly depending on the type of care and facility, with public facilities generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources, while private facilities can be quite expensive but offer better quality care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $23 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 38.0% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 117\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: CDF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in DR Congo is a mixed system, with both public and private facilities available. Public facilities are generally underfunded and understaffed, and often lack basic medical supplies and equipment. In contrast, private facilities are better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive and out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private facilities, as they tend to have more modern equipment and better-trained staff. However, even at private facilities, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the specific facility and the city in which it is located.\n\nThe healthcare system in DR Congo is not universal, and many people rely on out-of-pocket payments or traditional healers for their medical care. In fact, according to the World Bank, out-of-pocket spending accounts for 38.0% of total health expenditure in DR Congo. This can be a significant burden for many people, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare facilities can be limited. For foreigners, it is often recommended to have some form of health insurance, either through their employer or a private insurance provider, to help cover the cost of medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Prices vary by city and facility |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Prices vary by specialty and facility |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-20 | $20-30 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $20-30 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-100 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-50 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-500 | Prices vary by procedure and facility |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-300 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n| MRI Scan | $100-200 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n| X-Ray | $10-20 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-20 | Covers basic medical care, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Covers more extensive medical care, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Covers medical care abroad, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** can be expensive, with prices varying by medication and pharmacy\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are generally more affordable, with prices starting at around $5-10\n- **Pharmacy availability** can be limited in rural areas, with many people relying on traditional healers or traveling to larger cities for medical care\n- **Prescription rules** vary by medication and pharmacy, with some requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- **Common medications** such as antibiotics and painkillers can be found at many pharmacies, but may be more expensive than in other countries\n- **Vaccinations** are available at many pharmacies and healthcare facilities, but can be expensive, with prices starting at around $20-50\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to seek care at a private facility, as they tend to have more modern equipment and better-trained staff.
