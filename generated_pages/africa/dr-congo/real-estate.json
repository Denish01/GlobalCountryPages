However, the market is also marked by a lack of infrastructure, limited access to financing, and a complex regulatory environment. As a result, prices for property in DR Congo can be relatively high, especially in urban areas such as Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. The market is also subject to fluctuations in the global economy, as well as local factors such as political instability and changes in government policy.

However, the rural property market is less developed, with limited access to infrastructure and services. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for investment in rural areas, particularly in the agriculture and mining sectors. The price trajectory of property in DR Congo is generally upward, driven by demand from both local and foreign investors. However, the market can be volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly in response to changes in the global economy or local conditions.\n\nThe property market in DR Congo is also marked by a lack of transparency and accountability, with limited access to information about property ownership and transactions.
