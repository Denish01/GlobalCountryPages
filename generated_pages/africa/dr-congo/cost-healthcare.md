[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in DR Congo is a mixed system, with both public and private facilities available. Public facilities are generally underfunded and understaffed, and often lack basic medical supplies and equipment. In contrast, private facilities are better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive and out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private facilities, as they tend to have more modern equipment and better-trained staff. However, even at private facilities, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the specific facility and the city in which it is located.

The healthcare system in DR Congo is not universal, and many people rely on out-of-pocket payments or traditional healers for their medical care. In fact, according to the World Bank, out-of-pocket spending accounts for 38.0% of total health expenditure in DR Congo. This can be a significant burden for many people, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare facilities can be limited. For foreigners, it is often recommended to have some form of health insurance, either through their employer or a private insurance provider, to help cover the cost of medical care.
