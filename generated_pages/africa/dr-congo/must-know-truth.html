        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) has a complex and tumultuous history. The area was first inhabited by various tribes and kingdoms, with the Kingdom of Kongo being one of the most prominent. In 1885, the <strong>Berlin Conference</strong> led to the colonization of the region by King Leopold II of Belgium, who established the <strong>Congo Free State</strong>. This period was marked by brutal exploitation and violence against the native population. In 1908, the Congo Free State was annexed by Belgium and became a Belgian colony, known as the <strong>Belgian Congo</strong>.</p>
        <p>The Belgian Congo gained independence on June 30, 1960, with <strong>Joseph Kasavubu</strong> as its first president. However, the newly independent country was plagued by instability, corruption, and power struggles. In 1965, <strong>Joseph Mobutu</strong> seized power and established a dictatorial regime, which lasted for over three decades. During this period, the country was renamed <strong>Zaire</strong> in 1971. In 1997, Mobutu was overthrown by <strong>Laurent-Désiré Kabila</strong>, who restored the country's original name, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
        <p>The DR Congo has been classified as a <strong>developing country</strong> by the United Nations, with a <strong>lower-middle-income economy</strong>. The country has a diverse geography, with tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountain ranges. The <strong>Congo River</strong>, which runs through the country, is the second-longest river in Africa and a vital source of hydroelectric power. The country's strategic location in central Africa makes it a crucial player in regional trade and politics.</p>
        <p>The DR Congo has been a member of the <strong>United Nations</strong> since 1960 and is also a member of the <strong>African Union</strong> and the <strong>Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa</strong>. The country has a rich cultural heritage, with over 450 ethnic groups and more than 700 languages spoken. The official language is <strong>French</strong>, but <strong>Lingala</strong>, <strong>Kikongo</strong>, and <strong>Swahili</strong> are also widely spoken.</p>
