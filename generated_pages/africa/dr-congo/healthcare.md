[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in the DR Congo is a mixed system, with both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to limited access to quality care, especially in rural areas. The private sector, on the other hand, offers better quality care, but it is often expensive and out of reach for the majority of the population. The quality of care in the DR Congo is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, with a **quality rating** of 2/5. Urban areas, such as Kinshasa, have better access to healthcare facilities and services, while rural areas often have limited or no access to basic healthcare services.

The DR Congo has a large and growing population, with over 112 million people, which puts a strain on the already limited healthcare resources. The country also faces significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to clean water and sanitation, and a high prevalence of infectious diseases such as **malaria**, **HIV/AIDS**, and **tuberculosis**. The government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding and implementing new policies, but much work remains to be done.

Despite the challenges, there are some positive trends in the healthcare system in the DR Congo. The country has made significant progress in reducing **child mortality** and improving **maternal health**, and there are many dedicated healthcare professionals working to provide quality care to patients. However, more needs to be done to address the systemic challenges and improve access to quality healthcare for all.
