The country's economy is primarily driven by the mining and agriculture sectors, with a significant portion of the population relying on subsistence farming. Despite its vast natural resources, the DR Congo's economy has struggled to develop due to various challenges, including corruption, lack of infrastructure, and political instability. The country's development level is relatively low, with a Human Development Index (HDI) ranking of 176 out of 189 countries.\n\nThe DR Congo's economic trajectory has been marked by periods of growth and decline, with the country experiencing a significant decline in economic activity during the 1990s and early 2000s due to civil war and political instability. However, in recent years, the country has experienced a modest growth rate, driven by increased investment in the mining sector and improvements in the business environment. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at promoting economic development, including the creation of a new investment code and the establishment of a one-stop shop for investors.\n\nDespite these efforts, the DR Congo's economy remains heavily dependent on the mining sector, which is vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. The country's economic classification is as a low-income economy, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line. The government has identified various development priorities, including the diversification of the economy, the improvement of infrastructure, and the promotion of private sector development.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mining | 70% of export revenue | Copper, cobalt, diamonds, gold, and coltan are the main minerals extracted |\n| Agriculture | 40% of GDP | Main crops include cassava, maize, rice, and beans, with a significant portion of the population relying on subsistence farming |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | Main products include textiles, food processing, and construction materials |\n| Services | 50% of GDP | Main sectors include finance, trade, and transportation |\n| Tourism | less than 1% of GDP | The country has significant tourism potential, with attractions including Virunga National Park and the Congo River |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Copper: The DR Congo is one of the world's largest producers of copper, with the majority of exports going to China and other Asian countries.\n- Cobalt: The country is the world's largest producer of cobalt, with the majority of exports used in the production of batteries and other electronics.\n- Diamonds: The DR Congo is a significant producer of diamonds, with the majority of exports going to Belgium and other European countries.\n- Gold: The country has significant gold reserves, with the majority of exports going to Switzerland and other European countries.\n- Timber: The DR Congo has significant timber reserves, with the majority of exports going to China and other Asian countries.\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- Machinery: The country imports significant amounts of machinery, including equipment for the mining and manufacturing sectors.\n- Transportation equipment: The DR Congo imports vehicles, aircraft, and other transportation equipment to support the development of its transportation network.\n- Fuel: The country imports significant amounts of fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.\n- Electronics: The DR Congo imports a range of electronic products, including computers, smartphones, and televisions.\n- Food: The country imports significant amounts of food, including rice, wheat, and soybeans.\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: China is the DR Congo's largest trading partner, with the majority of exports going to China and significant amounts of machinery and other equipment being imported.\n- Belgium: Belgium is a significant trading partner, with the majority of diamond exports going to Belgium and significant amounts of machinery and other equipment being imported.\n- South Africa: South Africa is a significant trading partner, with the majority of fuel imports coming from South Africa and significant amounts of machinery and other equipment being imported.\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The DR Congo has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with a total of approximately 2,000 kilometers of paved roads and a significant amount of unpaved roads.\n- The country has a number of ports, including the Port of Matadi, which is the largest port in the country and handles significant amounts of cargo.\n- The DR Congo has a relatively low level of internet and mobile penetration, with approximately 15% of the population having access to the internet and 30% having access to mobile phones.\n- The country has a number of airports, including the Kinshasa N'Djili International Airport, which is the largest airport in the country and handles significant amounts of passenger and cargo traffic.\n- The DR Congo has significant energy potential, with a number of hydroelectric dams and other energy sources, but the country struggles with a lack of access to electricity, with approximately 10% of the population having access to electricity.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe DR Congo's economic outlook is positive, with the country expected to experience modest growth in the coming years.
