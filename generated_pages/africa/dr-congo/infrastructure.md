# DR Congo Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in DR Congo is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, with limited access to electricity, poor road conditions, and inadequate water and sanitation facilities, despite recent investments and development efforts.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 19% of population
Internet Penetration: 17%
Road Network: 153,497 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: 4,082 km
Major Airports: 26
Major Ports: 1 major port on the Atlantic coast, with several smaller ports on lakes and rivers
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The infrastructure in DR Congo is one of the least developed in the world, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country has made efforts to improve its infrastructure in recent years, with investments in the energy and transport sectors. However, the pace of development is slow, and the country still faces significant challenges in providing access to basic services, particularly in rural areas. The urban-rural gap is also significant, with cities such as Kinshasa and Lubumbashi having better access to infrastructure services than rural areas.

The government has implemented several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a national infrastructure plan and the establishment of a public-private partnership framework to attract private sector investment. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, corruption, and inadequate institutional capacity. The international community has also provided support, with organizations such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank providing financing and technical assistance for infrastructure development projects.

Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for growth and development, particularly in the energy and mining sectors. The country has significant natural resources, including hydroelectric power potential, and is rich in minerals such as copper, cobalt, and diamonds. With the right investments and policies in place, the country can leverage these resources to drive economic growth and improve living standards for its citizens.
