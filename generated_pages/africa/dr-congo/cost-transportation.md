[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Getting around DR Congo can be challenging due to the country's vast size and limited infrastructure. The main transportation modes in DR Congo are taxis, buses, and minibuses, with most people relying on these forms of public transport to get around. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Kinshasa having a more developed network than other urban areas. However, even in Kinshasa, the public transportation system can be overcrowded and unreliable, making it essential to plan ahead and be flexible when traveling.

In rural areas, transportation options are often limited, and travelers may need to rely on private vehicles or hitchhiking to get around. The lack of infrastructure and limited access to transportation can make it difficult for people to access basic services, such as healthcare and education. Despite these challenges, many Congolese people are resourceful and have developed innovative solutions to navigate the country's transportation network.
