While it is possible to have a safe and rewarding experience in DR Congo, the country poses significant challenges for travelers. Crime, corruption, and instability are prevalent, and visitors should exercise extreme caution when traveling to or within the country. The capital city, Kinshasa, is generally considered safer than other parts of the country, but petty crime and scams are still common.\n\nTravelers should be aware of the risks of violent crime, including armed robbery and kidnapping, particularly in areas outside of Kinshasa. The eastern part of the country, near the borders with Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda, is particularly unstable and should be avoided. Additionally, the country's health care system is underdeveloped, and medical facilities are often inadequate, making it essential for travelers to take necessary precautions to stay healthy. Despite these challenges, many travelers visit DR Congo without incident, and with proper planning, preparation, and caution, it is possible to have a safe and enriching experience in this beautiful and diverse country.\n\n[SECTION] Safety By Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/Region | Safety Level | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kinshasa | Moderate | Petty crime and scams common, but generally safer than other areas |\n| Goma | High Risk | Volcanic activity and rebel groups present, avoid traveling at night |\n| Virunga National Park | Moderate | Safe for guided tours, but exercise caution due to wildlife and potential rebel activity |\n| Lubumbashi | Moderate | Petty crime common, but generally safer than other areas outside of Kinshasa |\n| Kisangani | High Risk | Rebel activity and crime prevalent, avoid traveling to this area |\n| Matadi | Moderate | Petty crime common, but generally safer than other areas outside of Kinshasa |\n| Bukavu | High Risk | Rebel activity and crime prevalent, avoid traveling to this area |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Common Risks & Scams [/SECTION]\n- **Armed robbery**: A significant risk, particularly in areas outside of Kinshasa, and often involves violence or intimidation.\n- **Scams**: Common, particularly in Kinshasa, and can involve anything from street scams to complex business scams.\n- **Kidnapping**: A risk, particularly in areas outside of Kinshasa, and often involves demands for ransom.\n- **Petty crime**: Common, particularly in Kinshasa, and can involve pickpocketing, mugging, or burglary.\n- **Traffic accidents**: A significant risk, due to poor road conditions and reckless driving.\n- **Rebel activity**: A risk, particularly in the eastern part of the country, and can involve violence or kidnapping.\n- **Corruption**: Widespread, and can involve demands for bribes or other forms of corruption.\n- **Health risks**: Significant, due to the presence of diseases such as malaria, Ebola, and cholera.\n\n[SECTION] Health & Medical [/SECTION]\n- **Vaccinations**: Recommended vaccinations include yellow fever, hepatitis A, and typhoid, and required vaccinations include yellow fever for travelers arriving from certain countries.\n- **Water Safety**: Tap water is not safe to drink, and bottled or filtered water is recommended.\n- **Medical Facilities**: Medical facilities are often inadequate, and travelers may need to be evacuated to another country for medical care.\n- **Pharmacy Access**: Pharmacy access is limited, and travelers should bring any necessary medications with them.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Safety Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of your surroundings, particularly in crowded areas or at night.\n- Avoid displaying signs of wealth, such as jewelry or expensive watches.\n- Use reputable taxi services or ride-sharing apps, and avoid hitchhiking or accepting rides from strangers.\n- Keep valuables secure, and consider using a hotel safe or a money belt.\n- Avoid traveling at night, particularly in areas outside of Kinshasa.\n- Stay informed about local conditions, and follow local advice and instructions.\n- Consider hiring a guide or joining a guided tour, particularly in areas outside of Kinshasa.\n\n[SECTION] For Solo & Women Travelers [/SECTION]\n- **Dress modestly**: Avoid drawing attention to yourself, and dress conservatively, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Avoid traveling alone at night**: Consider hiring a guide or joining a guided tour, particularly in areas outside of Kinshasa.\n- **Be prepared for harassment**: Unfortunately, harassment is common, and women travelers should be prepared for catcalls, stares, and other forms of harassment.\n- **Stay in touch with family and friends**: Regularly check in with family and friends, and let them know your itinerary and plans.",
