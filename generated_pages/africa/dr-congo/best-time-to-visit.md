# Best Time to Visit DR Congo — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) is during the dry season, from May to September, when the weather is dry and temperatures are mild, making it ideal for traveling and exploring the country's vast wilderness and cultural attractions.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit DR Congo: May to September. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: April to May and September to November. Avoid: December to March due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The DR Congo has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by dry and mild weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). This is the best time to visit the country, as the dry conditions make it easier to travel and explore the country's national parks, forests, and other attractions. The wet season, which runs from October to April, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it more challenging to travel and engage in outdoor activities.

The country's climate varies across its different regions, with the southern region being generally drier and cooler than the northern region. The mountainous regions, such as the Virunga Mountains, have a cooler climate than the low-lying areas, with average temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F). The dry and wet seasons also affect the country's wildlife, with many animals migrating to different areas in search of food and water during the wet season.

The seasons also impact the country's infrastructure, with some roads and bridges becoming impassable during the wet season. Additionally, the wet season can lead to an increase in diseases such as malaria and cholera, making it essential for travelers to take necessary precautions and consult with their doctors before traveling to the country.
