  "content": "The Democratic Republic of the Congo is home to a diverse population of over 112 million people, with a complex mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 112,832,000\nPopulation Growth Rate: 3.2%\nMedian Age: 17.4 years\nUrban Population: 43.4%\nPopulation Density: 48 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 59.3 years\nFertility Rate: 6.2 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is the second-most populous country in Africa, with a population that is projected to continue growing rapidly. The country's population size is significant, accounting for approximately 12% of the total population of Africa. The population growth rate is high, with an estimated 3.2% annual growth rate, which is driven by a high fertility rate and declining mortality rates. Urbanization is also on the rise, with approximately 43% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Kinshasa. Migration patterns in the country are complex, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of economic opportunities, while others are forced to flee their homes due to conflict and instability.\n\nThe country's population is characterized by a high proportion of young people, with approximately 60% of the population under the age of 25. This demographic trend presents both opportunities and challenges for the country, as it will need to create jobs and provide education and healthcare services to its rapidly growing population. The population is also distributed unevenly across the country, with the majority of people living in the western and central regions. The eastern region, which is rich in natural resources, is also home to many different ethnic groups and has experienced significant conflict and instability in recent years.\n\nThe population of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also characterized by significant health challenges, including high rates of malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases. The country's healthcare system is underdeveloped, and many people lack access to basic healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. Efforts are being made to improve healthcare services and reduce mortality rates, but significant challenges remain.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kongo | 16% | West and southwest | One of the largest ethnic groups in the country |\n| Luba | 14% | Southeast | Skilled traders and farmers |\n| Mongo | 13% | Central and south | Known for their expertise in hunting and gathering |\n| Mangbetu | 7% | Northeast | Traditionally skilled in crafts and trade |\n| Bwile | 6% | Southeast | Known for their expertise in agriculture and fishing |\n| Teke | 5% | West | Traditionally skilled in hunting and gathering |\n| Zande | 4% | Northeast | Known for their expertise in crafts and trade |\n| Hema | 3% | Northeast | Traditionally skilled in herding and farming |\n[/TABLE]\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is home to over 450 different ethnic groups, each with their own language, culture, and traditions.

The ethnic groups in the country have historically coexisted relatively peacefully, although there have been periods of conflict and tension, particularly in the eastern region.
