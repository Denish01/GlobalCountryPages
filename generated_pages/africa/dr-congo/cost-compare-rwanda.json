  "content": "Overall, DR Congo is cheaper than Rwanda, with a cost of living that is roughly 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nDR Congo GDP per Capita (PPP): 784\nRwanda GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,341\nDR Congo Inflation Rate: 5.5%\nRwanda Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): DR Congo\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: DR Congo vs Rwanda [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in DR Congo and Rwanda varies significantly, reflecting the different economic contexts of the two countries. DR Congo, with its large population and abundant natural resources, has a lower cost of living due to its relatively low prices for food, housing, and transportation. In contrast, Rwanda, with its smaller population and more developed economy, has a higher cost of living, driven by its focus on tourism and high-end services. Overall, DR Congo is generally cheaper than Rwanda, with a cost of living that is roughly 20-30% lower.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. DR Congo has a largely informal economy, with many people engaged in subsistence farming or small-scale trade, which keeps prices low. In contrast, Rwanda has a more formalized economy, with a strong focus on services and tourism, which drives up prices. Additionally, Rwanda's efforts to develop its infrastructure and attract foreign investment have led to an increase in prices for housing, food, and other essentials.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | DR Congo (USD) | Rwanda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 400 | 100% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 67% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 800 | 100% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | DR Congo (USD) | Rwanda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 100% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 80 | 60% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 50% more |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 100% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | DR Congo (USD) | Rwanda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 100% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 100% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | DR Congo (USD) | Rwanda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 60% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 50% more |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | DR Congo (USD) | Rwanda (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 300 | 500 | 40% |\n| Mid-Range | 600 | 1,000 | 40% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 2,000 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **DR Congo is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 50-100% lower than in Rwanda\n- Food and groceries, with prices that are 30-60% lower than in Rwanda\n- Transportation, with prices that are 30-50% lower than in Rwanda\n- **Rwanda is cheaper for:**\n- High-end services and tourism, with a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of amenities\n- Internet and mobile services, with faster and more reliable connections\n- Education, with a more developed education system and a wider range of international schools\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, DR Congo offers a more affordable cost of living, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.
