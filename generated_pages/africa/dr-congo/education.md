[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in DR Congo is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory, lasts for six years and is typically attended by children between the ages of 6 and 12. Secondary education, which is not compulsory, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for four years and the second cycle lasts for two years. Tertiary education is provided by universities and other higher education institutions, with the **University of Kinshasa** being one of the most prestigious institutions in the country. The quality of education in DR Congo varies significantly between public and private institutions, with private schools generally offering higher-quality education but at a higher cost.

The public education system in DR Congo faces several challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including the introduction of free primary education and the construction of new schools. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in access to education, particularly in rural areas where many children do not have access to schools.

The private education sector in DR Congo is relatively well-developed, with many private schools and universities offering high-quality education. However, these institutions are often expensive and out of reach for many Congolese citizens. As a result, there is a significant gap in access to quality education between the rich and the poor, with the wealthy having greater access to better educational opportunities.
