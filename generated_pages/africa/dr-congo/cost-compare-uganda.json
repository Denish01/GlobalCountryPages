DR Congo has a larger economy, driven by its rich natural resources, including copper, cobalt, and diamonds. However, the country's economic growth has been hindered by corruption, political instability, and infrastructure challenges. Uganda, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a growing services sector and a strong focus on agriculture. The cost of living in Uganda is generally lower than in DR Congo, making it a more attractive destination for expats, students, and travelers.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. DR Congo's economy is more heavily reliant on natural resources, which can lead to fluctuations in prices and economic instability. In contrast, Uganda's economy is more stable, with a growing middle class and a relatively low inflation rate. Overall, Uganda offers a more affordable and stable living environment, with a lower cost of living that is around 20-30% lower than DR Congo.
