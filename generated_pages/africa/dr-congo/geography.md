[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is located in central Africa, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is the second-largest country in Africa by land area and is surrounded by nine countries, including the Republic of Congo to the west, the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi to the east, and Tanzania, Zambia, and Angola to the south. The country's unique location and geography have made it a crossroads for trade and cultural exchange between different regions of Africa.

The DR Congo's borders are largely defined by its natural features, including the **Congo River** to the west and the **Great Lakes** to the east. The country's coastline along the Atlantic Ocean is relatively short, but its **port city of Matadi** is an important hub for international trade. The DR Congo's borders have been the subject of some disputes over the years, particularly with neighboring countries, but the country has made significant progress in recent years in terms of regional cooperation and conflict resolution.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The DR Congo is a country of great geographical diversity, with a range of different landscapes and ecosystems. The country can be broadly divided into four main regions: the **coastal lowlands** along the Atlantic Ocean, the **Congo Basin** in the center of the country, the **highlands** to the east, and the **savannas** to the south. The Congo Basin is the largest tropical rainforest in Africa, covering an area of over 2 million square kilometers, and is home to a vast array of plant and animal species.

The DR Congo is also home to several major mountain ranges, including the **Ruvenzori Mountains** to the east and the **Kivu Mountains** to the southeast. These mountains are not only important for their natural beauty, but also for their economic significance, as they are rich in minerals such as **copper**, **cobalt**, and **gold**. The country's many rivers, including the **Congo River**, **Kasai River**, and **Ubangi River**, are also important for transportation, fishing, and hydroelectric power.

The DR Congo's terrain and landscape have played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture. The country's many natural resources have made it an attractive destination for traders and colonizers over the centuries, while its remote and inaccessible regions have also made it a haven for **indigenous communities** and **refugees**. Today, the DR Congo is working to balance its economic development with environmental protection and social justice, in order to preserve its unique natural heritage for future generations.
