[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in DR Congo is generally of poor quality, with slow speeds and frequent outages, especially in rural areas. The urban-rural divide is significant, with major cities like Kinshasa and Lubumbashi having better internet connectivity compared to smaller towns and villages. However, even in urban areas, the reliability of internet services can be a challenge, with frequent power outages and network congestion affecting the quality of internet connections. Internet services are mostly provided by mobile network operators, with a few internet service providers offering fixed-line connections in major cities.

The government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber-optic cables and mobile network upgrades. However, the progress has been slow, and the country still lags behind other African nations in terms of internet penetration and quality. Despite these challenges, the demand for internet services is increasing, driven by the growing number of mobile phone users and the need for online services in sectors like education, healthcare, and finance. As a result, there are opportunities for improvement, and visitors can still find ways to stay connected, especially in major cities.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in DR Congo, you can visit the offices of mobile network operators like Vodacom, Orange, or Airtel, which are usually located in major cities. You will need to provide a valid passport and a copy of your visa to purchase a SIM card. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans are available from 1 USD per day for 100 MB of data.
