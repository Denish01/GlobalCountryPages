        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) has a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $615. The country's economy is primarily driven by the mining and agriculture sectors, with a significant portion of the population relying on subsistence farming. Despite its vast natural resources, the DR Congo's economy has struggled to develop due to various challenges, including corruption, lack of infrastructure, and political instability. The country's development level is relatively low, with a Human Development Index (HDI) ranking of 176 out of 189 countries.</p>
        <p>The DR Congo's economic trajectory has been marked by periods of growth and decline, with the country experiencing a significant decline in economic activity during the 1990s and early 2000s due to civil war and political instability. However, in recent years, the country has experienced a modest growth rate, driven by increased investment in the mining sector and improvements in the business environment. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at promoting economic development, including the creation of a new investment code and the establishment of a one-stop shop for investors.</p>
        <p>Despite these efforts, the DR Congo's economy remains heavily dependent on the mining sector, which is vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. The country's economic classification is as a low-income economy, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line. The government has identified various development priorities, including the diversification of the economy, the improvement of infrastructure, and the promotion of private sector development.</p>
