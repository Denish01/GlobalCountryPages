[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe has a lower-middle-income economy, characterized by a high level of informality and a significant dependence on agriculture and mining. The country's economy has experienced significant fluctuations over the years, with periods of high growth followed by decline, largely due to factors such as drought, corruption, and economic mismanagement. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented various reforms aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including efforts to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. The economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from Zimbabweans living abroad, which provides a crucial source of foreign exchange.

The country's economic development has been hindered by a range of factors, including a lack of investment, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled labor. Additionally, the economy has been affected by a series of economic sanctions imposed by Western countries, which have limited the country's access to international credit and investment. However, the government has made efforts to diversify the economy and promote private sector growth, with a focus on sectors such as tourism, manufacturing, and technology.

Zimbabwe's economic trajectory is closely tied to the performance of its key industries, including mining and agriculture. The country is richly endowed with natural resources, including gold, platinum, and diamonds, which provide a significant source of export earnings. The agricultural sector is also a crucial component of the economy, with crops such as tobacco, cotton, and maize being major export earners. However, the sector has been affected by factors such as drought, soil degradation, and a lack of investment, which have impacted on productivity and output.
