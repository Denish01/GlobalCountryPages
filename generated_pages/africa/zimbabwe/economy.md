[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe has a lower-middle-income economy, which has been facing significant challenges in recent years, including high inflation, a large trade deficit, and a severe shortage of foreign exchange. The country's economic development level is relatively low, with a significant portion of the population engaged in informal economic activities. The economic trajectory of Zimbabwe has been marked by periods of high growth, followed by decline, with the country struggling to achieve sustainable economic development. The government has been implementing various reforms aimed at improving the business environment, promoting private sector growth, and increasing foreign investment.

The economy of Zimbabwe is highly dependent on agriculture, with the sector accounting for a significant portion of the country's GDP and employment. However, the sector has been facing challenges, including drought, poor farming practices, and a lack of investment in agricultural infrastructure. The mining sector is also an important contributor to the economy, with Zimbabwe being a significant producer of minerals such as platinum, gold, and diamonds. The manufacturing sector has been struggling, with many factories operating below capacity due to a lack of foreign exchange and high production costs.

The government of Zimbabwe has been working to improve the economy, with a focus on promoting private sector growth, increasing foreign investment, and improving the business environment. The government has also been implementing policies aimed at reducing poverty and inequality, including the provision of social services and support to small-scale farmers. However, the country still faces significant economic challenges, including a large trade deficit, high inflation, and a severe shortage of foreign exchange.
