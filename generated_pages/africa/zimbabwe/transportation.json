Direct flights are available from major hubs such as Johannesburg, Addis Ababa, and Nairobi. You can also enter Zimbabwe by land through border posts with neighboring countries such as Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa, and Botswana. The most popular overland entry points are the Beitbridge border post with South Africa and the Victoria Falls border post with Zambia.\n\nIf you're planning to enter Zimbabwe by land, it's essential to ensure that you have all the necessary documents, including a valid passport, visa (if required), and car insurance (if driving). You should also be prepared for potential delays and long queues at the border posts, especially during peak travel seasons. Additionally, it's a good idea to research the current border crossing requirements and any travel restrictions before embarking on your journey.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nZimbabwe has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting major cities such as Harare, Bulawayo, and Victoria Falls. The main domestic airlines are Air Zimbabwe and Fastjet, which offer regular flights between these cities. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best rates. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and time of booking. It's also worth noting that domestic flights may be subject to cancellations or schedule changes, so it's essential to stay in touch with your airline for any updates.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nZimbabwe's rail network is limited, with most trains operating on a limited schedule and with outdated infrastructure. The National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) operates passenger trains between major cities, but the service is often slow and unreliable.

However, taking the train can be a scenic and affordable way to see the countryside, with approximate costs ranging from $10 to $50, depending on the route and class of service.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nSeveral bus companies operate in Zimbabwe, offering intercity services between major towns and cities. Some of the popular bus companies include Intercape, Greyhound, and Pathfinder. The quality of the buses varies, but most offer a relatively comfortable and affordable way to get around. Routes and schedules are available online or at bus terminals, and costs range from $10 to $50, depending on the route and class of service.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Harare, Bulawayo | 0.50-1.00 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Taxi | everywhere | 5-10/km | Metered taxis available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing | Harare, Bulawayo | 5-10 | Local alternatives such as Vaya and Hwindi |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | no |  | Not commonly used in Zimbabwe |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Zimbabwe, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country or an international driver's license.\n- Road conditions in Zimbabwe are generally poor, with many roads being unpaved or in disrepair.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, with gasoline prices averaging around $1.50 per liter.\n- Car rental companies are available at major airports and cities, but prices can be steep, with daily rates ranging from $50 to $100.\n- When driving in Zimbabwe, be aware of potential hazards such as potholes, livestock on the road, and aggressive drivers.\n- It's also essential to ensure that your vehicle is in good condition and equipped with necessary safety features, such as a spare tire and first-aid kit.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- When using taxis or ride-hailing services, always agree on the fare before you start your journey to avoid potential scams.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or public transport.\n- Download local apps such as Vaya or Hwindi to book ride-hailing services or find the best routes.\n- When driving, always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to avoid fines or accidents.\n- Be prepared for potential delays or disruptions to transport services, especially during peak travel seasons or due to weather conditions.\n- Learn some basic phrases in local languages such as **Shona** or **Ndebele** to help you communicate with locals and get around more easily.\n- Always carry some cash with you, as not all transport services or businesses accept credit or debit cards.\n- Consider hiring a reputable tour operator or guide to help you navigate Zimbabwe's transport system and get the most out of your trip.",
