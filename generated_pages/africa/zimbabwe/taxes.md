[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe has a **territorial tax system**, which means that individuals and companies are taxed on their income earned within the country, regardless of their residence status. However, residents are also taxed on their foreign-sourced income, subject to certain exemptions and credits. The **residency rules** for tax purposes in Zimbabwe are based on physical presence, with individuals considered residents if they are present in the country for more than 183 days in a tax year. Residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on their Zimbabwe-sourced income.

The tax system in Zimbabwe is administered by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs, and excise duties. The tax year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of April of the following year. Zimbabwe has a network of **double taxation treaties** with 13 countries, including South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Australia, which aim to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion.
