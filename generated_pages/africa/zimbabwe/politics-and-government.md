[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Zimbabwe is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and government. The President is directly elected by the people and serves a five-year term. The **legislative branch** is bicameral, consisting of the Senate and the House of Assembly. The Senate has 80 seats, with 60 members elected by proportional representation and 20 members appointed by the President. The House of Assembly has 210 seats, with members elected by single-member constituencies. The **judicial branch** is independent and consists of the Supreme Court, the High Court, and lower courts.

The system of government in Zimbabwe is characterized by a strong **presidential system**, where the President has significant powers and influence over the other branches of government. The President appoints the Cabinet, which is responsible for implementing government policies. The legislative branch has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto or assent to bills. The judicial branch has the power to interpret laws and ensure that they are consistent with the Constitution.

The **separation of powers** in Zimbabwe is not always clear-cut, and there have been instances where the executive branch has interfered with the independence of the judiciary and the legislature. The government has also been criticized for its handling of opposition parties and civil society organizations, with some accusing it of suppressing dissent and limiting freedom of speech.
