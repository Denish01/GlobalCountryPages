# Best Time to Visit Zimbabwe — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Zimbabwe is during the dry season, from May to October, when the weather is mild and wildlife viewing is optimal.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Zimbabwe: May to October. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: November to April. Avoid: January to March due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe has a subtropical climate with three distinct seasons: a warm, wet season from November to March, a cool, dry season from April to July, and a hot, dry season from August to October. The country can be divided into five climate zones, ranging from tropical in the low-lying areas to temperate in the highlands. The dry season is the best time to visit Zimbabwe, as the weather is mild and comfortable, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C. During this time, the wildlife is more concentrated around water sources, making it easier to spot animals.

The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as the heavy rainfall can make roads impassable and some tourist attractions may be closed. However, the wet season is also a time of lush vegetation and an abundance of wildlife, making it a great time for birdwatching and photography. The hot, dry season can be very hot, with temperatures often reaching over 30°C, but it is also a good time to visit, as the wildlife is still active and the scenery is particularly beautiful.

The seasons in Zimbabwe can have a significant impact on travel plans, as some tourist attractions may be closed or inaccessible during the wet season. Additionally, the dry season is the peak tourist season, and prices for accommodations and tours may be higher. However, the dry season is also the best time to see the **Victoria Falls**, one of Zimbabwe's most famous attractions, as the water levels are at their highest.
