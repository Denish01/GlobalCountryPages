# Zimbabwe Visa & Entry Requirements

To enter Zimbabwe, citizens of most countries require a visa, which can be obtained on arrival or in advance, depending on their nationality and purpose of visit.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe has a moderate visa policy, with visa-free access granted to citizens of about 40 countries, including some African and Asian nations. Citizens of countries that are not visa-exempt must obtain a visa on arrival or in advance, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit. The Zimbabwean government has introduced an eVisa system to facilitate the application process for tourists and business travelers.

The visa policy is designed to promote tourism and economic development while ensuring national security and public safety. The government has also introduced various visa categories, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, to cater to different types of visitors. The visa requirements and regulations are subject to change, so it is essential to check with the official embassy or consulate of Zimbabwe for the latest information.
