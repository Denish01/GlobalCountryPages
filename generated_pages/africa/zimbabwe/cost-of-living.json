[/SECTION]\nZimbabwe is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with costs comparable to its neighboring countries. However, the economy has been volatile in recent years, and prices can fluctuate. Compared to other countries in Southern Africa, Zimbabwe is generally cheaper than South Africa but more expensive than Mozambique. The cost of living in Zimbabwe's capital city, Harare, is higher than in other parts of the country. Overall, Zimbabwe offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expats.\n\nThe country's economy has been affected by hyperinflation in the past, which has led to a dual currency system, with the US dollar being widely accepted alongside the local Zimbabwean dollar. This has made it easier for tourists to navigate the country, as many businesses quote prices in USD. However, it's still important to be mindful of the exchange rate and to have some local currency for small purchases and transactions.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $10-20 | basic dorms and shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $40-80 | comfortable rooms with en-suite bathrooms |\n| Luxury/Resort | $150-300 | high-end amenities and services |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $200-500 | city center, furnished, 1-bedroom |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $100-300 | outside city center, furnished, 1-bedroom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-20 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-40 |\n| Fine Dining | $50-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $2-5 |\n| Coffee | $1-3 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.50-1 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 200 | 400 | 800 |\n| Food | 150 | 300 | 600 |\n| Transport | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Utilities | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Entertainment | 100 | 200 | 400 |\n| **Total** | **600** | **1,200** | **2,400** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in guesthouses or self-catering apartments, which can be more affordable than hotels.\n- Eat at local restaurants and try traditional dishes, which are often cheaper and more flavorful than international cuisine.\n- Use public transport or walk/bike whenever possible, as taxis can be expensive.\n- Avoid exchanging money at airports or hotels, as the rates are often unfavorable.\n- Shop at local markets for fresh produce and other essentials, which can be cheaper than supermarkets.\n- Be mindful of the exchange rate and try to use USD for larger transactions to avoid losing money on currency conversion.",
