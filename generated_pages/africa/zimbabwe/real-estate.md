[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Zimbabwe has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, due to economic instability and hyperinflation. However, the market has shown signs of recovery, with prices stabilizing and even increasing in some areas. The demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, remains high, driven by a growing population and a shortage of affordable housing. The trend is towards **urbanization**, with many people moving to cities in search of employment and better living standards. The price trajectory has been upward, especially in the capital city of Harare, where prices have increased significantly over the past few years.

The property market in Zimbabwe can be divided into two main segments: urban and rural. The urban market is characterized by high demand and limited supply, resulting in higher prices. In contrast, the rural market is less developed, with lower demand and prices. However, there are opportunities for investment in rural areas, particularly in **agricultural land** and **tourism-related properties**. The market is also influenced by the **dollarization** of the economy, which has brought stability to the market, but also made it more challenging for locals to afford properties.

The government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including the introduction of **mortgage financing** and **subsidized housing schemes**. These initiatives have helped to increase access to housing, particularly for low-income households. However, the market still faces challenges, including a shortage of **foreign currency** and **infrastructure constraints**. Despite these challenges, the property market in Zimbabwe offers opportunities for investment and growth, particularly for those who are willing to take a long-term view.
