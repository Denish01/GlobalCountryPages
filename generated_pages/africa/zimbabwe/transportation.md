[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe has several international airports, with Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare being the main entry point. Direct flights are available from major hubs such as Johannesburg, Addis Ababa, and Nairobi. You can also enter Zimbabwe by land through border posts with neighboring countries such as Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa, and Botswana. The most popular overland entry points are the Beitbridge border post with South Africa and the Victoria Falls border post with Zambia.

If you're planning to enter Zimbabwe by land, it's essential to ensure that you have all the necessary documents, including a valid passport, visa (if required), and car insurance (if driving). You should also be prepared for potential delays and long queues at the border posts, especially during peak travel seasons. Additionally, it's a good idea to research the current border crossing requirements and any travel restrictions before embarking on your journey.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting major cities such as Harare, Bulawayo, and Victoria Falls. The main domestic airlines are Air Zimbabwe and Fastjet, which offer regular flights between these cities. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best rates. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and time of booking. It's also worth noting that domestic flights may be subject to cancellations or schedule changes, so it's essential to stay in touch with your airline for any updates.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe's rail network is limited, with most trains operating on a limited schedule and with outdated infrastructure. The National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) operates passenger trains between major cities, but the service is often slow and unreliable. There are no high-speed trains in Zimbabwe, and the booking process can be cumbersome. However, taking the train can be a scenic and affordable way to see the countryside, with approximate costs ranging from $10 to $50, depending on the route and class of service.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Several bus companies operate in Zimbabwe, offering intercity services between major towns and cities. Some of the popular bus companies include Intercape, Greyhound, and Pathfinder. The quality of the buses varies, but most offer a relatively comfortable and affordable way to get around. Routes and schedules are available online or at bus terminals, and costs range from $10 to $50, depending on the route and class of service.
