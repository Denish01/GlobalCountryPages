Citizens of countries that are not visa-exempt must obtain a visa on arrival or in advance, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit. The Zimbabwean government has introduced an eVisa system to facilitate the application process for tourists and business travelers.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to promote tourism and economic development while ensuring national security and public safety. The government has also introduced various visa categories, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, to cater to different types of visitors. The visa requirements and regulations are subject to change, so it is essential to check with the official embassy or consulate of Zimbabwe for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended up to 6 months |\n| UK Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended up to 6 months |\n| EU Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended up to 6 months |\n| Canadian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended up to 6 months |\n| Australian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended up to 6 months |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can obtain a visa on arrival, which is valid for up to 30 days and can be extended up to 6 months.
