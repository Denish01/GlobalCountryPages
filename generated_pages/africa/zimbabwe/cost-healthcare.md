[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe's healthcare system is a mix of public and private facilities, with the public sector providing the majority of healthcare services to the population. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a shortage of medical supplies, equipment, and personnel. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are better equipped and staffed, but are often expensive and out of reach for the average citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. Having health insurance is recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the high costs of private healthcare.

The healthcare system in Zimbabwe is also plagued by a shortage of medical personnel, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country in search of better opportunities. This has led to a significant brain drain in the healthcare sector, further exacerbating the challenges faced by the public healthcare system. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent private hospitals and medical facilities in Zimbabwe, particularly in the major cities of Harare and Bulawayo. These facilities offer high-quality medical care, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the average citizen.
