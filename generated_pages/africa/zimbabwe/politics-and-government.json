The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and government. The President is directly elected by the people and serves a five-year term. The **legislative branch** is bicameral, consisting of the Senate and the House of Assembly. The Senate has 80 seats, with 60 members elected by proportional representation and 20 members appointed by the President. The House of Assembly has 210 seats, with members elected by single-member constituencies. The **judicial branch** is independent and consists of the Supreme Court, the High Court, and lower courts.\n\nThe system of government in Zimbabwe is characterized by a strong **presidential system**, where the President has significant powers and influence over the other branches of government. The President appoints the Cabinet, which is responsible for implementing government policies. The legislative branch has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto or assent to bills. The judicial branch has the power to interpret laws and ensure that they are consistent with the Constitution.\n\nThe **separation of powers** in Zimbabwe is not always clear-cut, and there have been instances where the executive branch has interfered with the independence of the judiciary and the legislature. The government has also been criticized for its handling of opposition parties and civil society organizations, with some accusing it of suppressing dissent and limiting freedom of speech.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President Emmerson Mnangagwa | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Cabinet | Various ministers | Implementation of government policies |\n| Legislative | Senate | President of the Senate - Mabel Chinomona | Upper house of parliament |\n| Legislative | House of Assembly | Speaker of the House of Assembly - Jacob Mudenda | Lower house of parliament |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice - Luke Malaba | Highest court in the land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ZANU-PF | Center-right | Emmerson Mnangagwa | 179 | Ruling party since 1980 |\n| MDC Alliance | Center-left | Nelson Chamisa | 88 | Main opposition party |\n| MDC-T | Center-left | Douglas Mwonzora | 33 | Breakaway faction of MDC Alliance |\n| NPF | Center-left | Ambrose Mutinhiri | 0 | New party formed by former ZANU-PF members |\n| Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) | Center-left | Dumiso Dabengwa | 0 | Former liberation movement turned political party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Zimbabwe is based on a **first-past-the-post** system, where the candidate with the most votes wins the seat.\n- Elections are held every five years for the presidency and the House of Assembly.\n- The last election was held in 2018, which saw Emmerson Mnangagwa win the presidency with 50.8% of the vote.\n- The next election is scheduled for 2023, with the opposition MDC Alliance already indicating that it will participate.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Zimbabwe is marked by **high levels of polarization** and tension between the ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition.\n- The government has been criticized for its handling of the economy, which has been marked by **high inflation** and **shortages of basic goods**.\n- The country faces significant **regional dynamics**, including its relationship with neighboring countries such as South Africa and Mozambique.\n- Zimbabwe has been ranked as **\"not free\"** by Freedom House, with significant limitations on freedom of speech and assembly.\n- The government has also been accused of **human rights abuses**, including the use of excessive force against protesters and the suppression of dissent.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Zimbabwe is a member of the **United Nations** and the **African Union**, and has played an active role in regional organizations such as the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)**.\n- The country has **close ties** with China, which has provided significant economic and military aid to Zimbabwe.\n- Zimbabwe has also **improved relations** with the European Union, which has lifted some sanctions on the country in recent years.\n- The government has **strained relations** with Western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, which have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe over its human rights record.",
