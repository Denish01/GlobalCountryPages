[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe has a diverse linguistic landscape, with over 16 languages spoken across the country. The official languages, English, Shona, and Ndebele, are the most widely spoken and used for government, education, and business purposes. Shona is the most widely spoken indigenous language, with over 70% of the population speaking it as their first language. Ndebele is spoken by around 20% of the population, primarily in the western regions of the country. Regional dialects and minority languages, such as Kalanga and Sotho, are also spoken in various parts of the country. English is widely understood, particularly in urban areas and among the educated population, but proficiency levels can vary greatly depending on the region and individual.

The linguistic diversity of Zimbabwe is a reflection of the country's history and cultural heritage. Many Zimbabweans are multilingual, speaking two or more languages, including their indigenous language, English, and sometimes other regional languages. This multilingualism has contributed to the country's rich cultural diversity and has facilitated communication among people from different linguistic backgrounds. However, it also presents challenges, particularly in rural areas where access to education and language resources may be limited.

Despite the challenges, Zimbabwe has made significant progress in promoting language development and linguistic diversity. The government has implemented language policies aimed at promoting the use of indigenous languages in education and government, and there are efforts to develop language resources and materials for minority languages. Additionally, there is a growing interest in language learning and cultural exchange programs, which has helped to promote cross-cultural understanding and communication.
