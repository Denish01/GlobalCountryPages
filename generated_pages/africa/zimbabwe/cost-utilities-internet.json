  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Zimbabwe can vary greatly depending on the location, usage, and provider, with a typical monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment ranging from $150 to $300.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($80 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: ZWL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nZimbabwe's utility infrastructure quality is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages, especially during the dry season. The costs of utilities in Zimbabwe are fluctuating due to the country's high inflation rate, which was 104.7% in 2022. This means that the prices of utilities can change rapidly, making it challenging for consumers to budget and plan. Additionally, there is a notable seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher electricity and water bills during the summer months when usage is higher.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the introduction of prepaid electricity meters, which can help consumers manage their energy usage and costs more effectively. However, the overall quality of the utility infrastructure remains a significant challenge, and consumers often have to rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators or solar power, to supplement the grid supply.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | metered billing |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in municipal taxes |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$160** | **$230** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | TelOne, Liquid Telecom |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 100 Mbps | TelOne, Liquid Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Econet, NetOne |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Econet, NetOne |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | TelOne, Liquid Telecom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | available in Zimbabwe |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Zimbabwe |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Zimbabwean content, e.g., Kwesé TV |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Zimbabwe, it is recommended to contact the relevant providers, such as ZESA for electricity and City of Harare for water, and provide the necessary documentation, including proof of residence and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help consumers manage their energy usage and costs more effectively.\n- The best internet providers in Zimbabwe are TelOne and Liquid Telecom, which offer a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, consumers can consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using alternative sources of energy, such as solar power.\n- It is also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans and providers to ensure that consumers are getting the best value for their money.",
