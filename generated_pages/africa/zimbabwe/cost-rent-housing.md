[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Zimbabwe is relatively competitive, with a mix of modern and older apartments and houses available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Control Act**, which regulates rent increases and provides safeguards against eviction. However, the housing market in Zimbabwe is still recovering from the economic crisis of the early 2000s, and prices can vary greatly depending on the location and condition of the property. Compared to regional neighbors, Zimbabwe's housing costs are relatively high, with prices similar to those in South Africa and higher than those in Zambia and Mozambique.

The housing market in Zimbabwe is also affected by the country's high **inflation rate**, which can make it difficult for renters to budget and plan for the future. Additionally, the **out-of-pocket health spend** of 10.6% can be a significant burden for renters, who may need to allocate a larger portion of their income towards healthcare expenses. Despite these challenges, Zimbabwe's housing market offers a range of options for renters, from modern apartments in the city center to older houses in the suburbs. With a **GDP per capita (PPP)** of $5,928, Zimbabwe's economy is growing, and the housing market is becoming more attractive to investors and renters alike.
