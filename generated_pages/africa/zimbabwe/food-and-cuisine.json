The country's food culture is centered around **Sadza**, a staple made from cornmeal or maize meal, which is often served with stews or relishes. The cuisine is also characterized by the use of fresh vegetables, beans, and meat, particularly beef and chicken. Regional variations in Zimbabwean cuisine include the use of different ingredients and cooking methods, such as the use of peanuts and cassava in the north and the use of fish in the eastern regions.\n\nZimbabwe's cuisine has been shaped by its history of colonization and trade, with European and Asian influences introducing new ingredients and cooking techniques. For example, the use of tomatoes and onions, which were introduced by European colonizers, is now a common feature of many Zimbabwean dishes. The country's cuisine has also been influenced by its neighboring countries, such as South Africa and Mozambique, with dishes like **Braai** (barbecued meat) and **Matooke** (steamed or boiled green bananas) being popular in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe food culture in Zimbabwe is also closely tied to the country's social and cultural traditions. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds. In rural areas, meals are often cooked over open fires, and the preparation and sharing of food is a communal activity. In urban areas, there is a growing trend towards modernizing traditional dishes and using new ingredients and cooking techniques.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sadza | Staple | Thick cornmeal porridge often served with stews or relishes | Throughout Zimbabwe |\n| Braai | Barbecued Meat | Grilled meat, usually beef or chicken, served with **Sadza** or **Rice** | Restaurants and roadside stalls |\n| Matooke | Steamed or Boiled Green Bananas | Steamed or boiled green bananas, often served with vegetables or meat | Eastern regions and urban areas |\n| Kapenta | Fried Fish | Small, dried fish, often served with **Sadza** or **Rice** | Lake Kariba and eastern regions |\n| Mopani Worms | Snack | Fried or boiled caterpillars, often served as a snack | Rural areas and roadside stalls |\n| Nyama Choma | Roasted Meat | Roasted meat, usually beef or goat, served with **Sadza** or **Rice** | Restaurants and roadside stalls |\n| Peanut Stew | Stew | Rich and flavorful stew made with peanuts, vegetables, and meat | Throughout Zimbabwe |\n| Tsamba | Fried Chicken | Fried chicken, often served with **Sadza** or **Rice** | Urban areas and restaurants |\n| Dovi | Stew | Stew made with peanuts, vegetables, and meat, often served with **Sadza** | Rural areas and roadside stalls |\n| Injiva | Fried Locusts | Fried locusts, often served as a snack | Rural areas and roadside stalls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Mapopo** (boiled or roasted maize on the cob): $1-2 USD\n- **Muriwo** (stewed vegetables): $2-3 USD\n- **Kapenta** (fried fish): $3-5 USD\n- **Tsamba** (fried chicken): $5-7 USD\n- **Mopani Worms** (fried or boiled caterpillars): $2-3 USD\n- **Injiva** (fried locusts): $2-3 USD\n- **Fresh Fruit** (such as mangoes, bananas, and apples): $1-2 USD\n- **Roasted Nuts** (such as peanuts and cashews): $2-3 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Mazoe** (freshly squeezed orange juice): $2-3 USD\n- **Castle Lager** (local beer): $3-5 USD\n- **Whiskey** (imported spirits): $5-10 USD\n- **Tea** (black tea, often served with milk and sugar): $1-2 USD\n- **Coffee** (instant coffee, often served with milk and sugar): $1-2 USD\n- **Maheu** (traditional fermented maize drink): $1-2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- It is customary to wash your hands before eating\n- Meals are often eaten with the hands, using **Sadza** as a utensil to scoop up food\n- It is polite to wait for the host to invite you to sit and eat\n- Tipping is customary, but not always expected\n- Dress codes are generally casual, but it is best to dress modestly when eating in rural areas\n- Reservations are not always necessary, but it is best to book ahead for popular restaurants\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Restaurants**: offering a range of traditional and modern dishes, from $10-20 USD per meal\n- **Roadside Stalls**: offering traditional snacks and drinks, from $1-5 USD per item\n- **Markets**: offering fresh produce, meat, and traditional dishes, from $5-10 USD per meal\n- **Food Courts**: offering a range of traditional and modern dishes, from $10-20 USD per meal\n- **Street Vendors**: offering traditional snacks and drinks, from $1-5 USD per item\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Mbare Market** (Harare): a bustling market offering fresh produce, meat, and traditional dishes\n- **Bulawayo Market** (Bulawayo): a large market offering fresh produce, meat, and traditional dishes\n- **Victoria Falls Market** (Victoria Falls): a tourist market offering traditional snacks and drinks\n- **Harare Food Festival** (Harare): an annual festival celebrating Zimbabwean cuisine and culture\n- **Zimbabwe Agricultural Show** (Harare): an annual show featuring local produce, livestock, and traditional dishes",
