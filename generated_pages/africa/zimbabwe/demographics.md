[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Zimbabwe is estimated to be around 17 million people, with a relatively high population growth rate of 2.3%. This growth rate is driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and a relatively young population, with a median age of 20.5 years. The population is split between urban and rural areas, with around 32% of the population living in urban areas, such as Harare and Bulawayo. The population density is approximately 43.8 people per square kilometer, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Zimbabwe's population is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that the population will reach around 22 million by 2030.

The population growth trends in Zimbabwe are influenced by a range of factors, including migration patterns, urbanization, and access to healthcare and education. The country has a significant diaspora community, with many Zimbabweans living and working in countries such as South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Australia. This migration has contributed to a brain drain in certain sectors, but it also provides an important source of remittances for many families. In terms of urbanization, Zimbabwe is experiencing a steady shift towards urban living, with many young people moving to cities in search of employment and better living standards.

One of the key challenges facing Zimbabwe's population is access to basic services, such as healthcare and education. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as vaccination rates and primary school enrollment. However, there are still significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and many communities lack access to basic infrastructure, such as clean water and sanitation.
