[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Zimbabwe is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers across the country. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, outdated equipment, and limited resources. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality care, but is often unaffordable for the majority of the population. Urban areas, such as Harare and Bulawayo, have better access to quality healthcare services compared to rural areas, where healthcare facilities are often basic and understaffed.

The quality of care in Zimbabwe is generally lower compared to other countries in the region. Many healthcare facilities lack modern equipment, and medical professionals often have limited training and resources. Additionally, the country faces a significant shortage of medical professionals, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country to seek better opportunities abroad. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent private hospitals and clinics in urban areas that offer high-quality care, often with English-speaking staff.

The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the renovation of public healthcare facilities. However, more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system in Zimbabwe.
