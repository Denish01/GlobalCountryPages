[SECTION] How Zimbabwe Is Divided [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe is divided into eight provinces, each with its own provincial capital and a distinct character. These provinces are further divided into districts and then into wards, which are the smallest administrative units. The provinces are Bulawayo, Harare, Manicaland, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Masvingo, and Matabeleland South. This division helps in the effective governance and administration of the country, with each province having its own set of responsibilities and functions.

The administrative structure of Zimbabwe is designed to ensure that power is decentralized and that each region has a certain degree of autonomy. This helps in addressing the unique needs and challenges of each province, which can vary significantly. For example, the province of Matabeleland South has a strong focus on agriculture, while the province of Harare is more focused on commerce and industry. This division also helps in promoting regional development and reducing regional disparities.
