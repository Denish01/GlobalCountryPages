[SECTION] How Zimbabwe Is Divided [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe is divided into eight provinces, which are further divided into districts and municipalities. The provinces are: Bulawayo, Harare, Manicaland, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Masvingo, and Matabeleland North and South. Each province has its own provincial capital and is governed by a provincial council. The provinces are responsible for delivering basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development to the local population.

The administrative structure of Zimbabwe is designed to promote decentralization and local participation in decision-making. However, the central government still plays a significant role in the overall governance of the country. The provinces are also divided into rural and urban areas, with the rural areas being further divided into wards and villages. The urban areas, on the other hand, are divided into municipalities and towns.
