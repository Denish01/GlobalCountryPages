# Zimbabwe Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Zimbabwe's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and water systems, although the rural-urban gap remains a major challenge.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 43% of population
Internet Penetration: 27%
Road Network: 97,267 km, with 19% paved
Rail Network: 3,427 km
Major Airports: 5
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has struggled with years of underinvestment, neglect, and economic sanctions, which have taken a toll on its infrastructure. However, recent investments, particularly from China, have helped to revitalize the country's infrastructure, with a focus on roads, energy, and water systems. The urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with cities like Harare and Bulawayo enjoying relatively better infrastructure than rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, which is expected to boost infrastructure development.

The government has also launched several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim Asset), which aims to promote economic growth and development through infrastructure investment. Additionally, the country has received funding from international organizations, such as the African Development Bank, to support infrastructure development projects. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure deficits, particularly in rural areas.

Zimbabwe's infrastructure faces several challenges, including a lack of maintenance, limited funding, and a shortage of skilled personnel. The country's infrastructure is also vulnerable to climate change, with frequent droughts and floods affecting the availability of water and energy. To address these challenges, the government needs to prioritize infrastructure investment, promote public-private partnerships, and develop strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
