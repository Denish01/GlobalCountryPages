[SECTION] How Expensive Is Zimbabwe? [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with costs comparable to its neighboring countries. However, the economy has been volatile in recent years, and prices can fluctuate. Compared to other countries in Southern Africa, Zimbabwe is generally cheaper than South Africa but more expensive than Mozambique. The cost of living in Zimbabwe's capital city, Harare, is higher than in other parts of the country. Overall, Zimbabwe offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expats.

The country's economy has been affected by hyperinflation in the past, which has led to a dual currency system, with the US dollar being widely accepted alongside the local Zimbabwean dollar. This has made it easier for tourists to navigate the country, as many businesses quote prices in USD. However, it's still important to be mindful of the exchange rate and to have some local currency for small purchases and transactions.
