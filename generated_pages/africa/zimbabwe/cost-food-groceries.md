[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Zimbabwe are generally higher than the regional average due to the country's economic challenges, including high inflation rates and a shortage of foreign currency. The inflation rate of 104.7% in 2022 has driven up prices, making it difficult for locals to afford basic necessities. Despite this, eating out is a common practice in Zimbabwe, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a variety of traditional dishes such as **sadza** (a thick cornmeal porridge), **stew**, and **braai** (barbecued meat). However, home cooking is also prevalent, with many locals opting to prepare meals at home using fresh produce from **local markets**.

The cost of food in Zimbabwe is also influenced by the availability of ingredients, with imported goods being more expensive than locally sourced products. The country's **agricultural sector** is a significant contributor to the economy, with many farms producing a range of crops, including **maize**, **wheat**, and **tobacco**. However, the sector faces challenges such as drought, soil degradation, and limited access to finance, which can impact food prices. Overall, the high cost of food in Zimbabwe makes it essential for locals and visitors to be mindful of their **grocery budgets** and to explore affordable options for eating out.
