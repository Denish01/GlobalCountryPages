  "content": "Zimbabwe, a sovereign country in southern Africa, is often misunderstood due to limited information and outdated stereotypes, but the real story reveals a complex and fascinating nation with a rich history, diverse culture, and resilient people.\n\n[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nZimbabwe has a long and complex history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Stone Age. The area was inhabited by various tribes, including the San and the Khoikhoi, before the arrival of the Bantu-speaking peoples, who established the Kingdom of Zimbabwe in the 11th century. The kingdom was a major power in the region, known for its impressive stone structures and trade networks. In the late 19th century, Zimbabwe was colonized by the British, who established the colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1890. The country gained independence on April 18, 1980, after a long and bloody struggle, and was renamed Zimbabwe. Since then, the country has been a member of the United Nations and the African Union, and has participated in various regional and international organizations.\n\nThe country's history is also marked by the rule of **Robert Mugabe**, who served as prime minister from 1980 to 1987 and as president from 1987 to 2017.
