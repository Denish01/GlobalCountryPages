[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe's cuisine is a reflection of the country's history and cultural diversity, with influences from African, European, and Asian traditions. The country's food culture is centered around **Sadza**, a staple made from cornmeal or maize meal, which is often served with stews or relishes. The cuisine is also characterized by the use of fresh vegetables, beans, and meat, particularly beef and chicken. Regional variations in Zimbabwean cuisine include the use of different ingredients and cooking methods, such as the use of peanuts and cassava in the north and the use of fish in the eastern regions.

Zimbabwe's cuisine has been shaped by its history of colonization and trade, with European and Asian influences introducing new ingredients and cooking techniques. For example, the use of tomatoes and onions, which were introduced by European colonizers, is now a common feature of many Zimbabwean dishes. The country's cuisine has also been influenced by its neighboring countries, such as South Africa and Mozambique, with dishes like **Braai** (barbecued meat) and **Matooke** (steamed or boiled green bananas) being popular in Zimbabwe.

The food culture in Zimbabwe is also closely tied to the country's social and cultural traditions. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds. In rural areas, meals are often cooked over open fires, and the preparation and sharing of food is a communal activity. In urban areas, there is a growing trend towards modernizing traditional dishes and using new ingredients and cooking techniques.
