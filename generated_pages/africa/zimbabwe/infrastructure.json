  "content": "Zimbabwe's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and water systems, although the rural-urban gap remains a major challenge.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 43% of population\nInternet Penetration: 27%\nRoad Network: 97,267 km, with 19% paved\nRail Network: 3,427 km\nMajor Airports: 5\nMajor Ports: 0, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nZimbabwe's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has struggled with years of underinvestment, neglect, and economic sanctions, which have taken a toll on its infrastructure. However, recent investments, particularly from China, have helped to revitalize the country's infrastructure, with a focus on roads, energy, and water systems. The urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with cities like Harare and Bulawayo enjoying relatively better infrastructure than rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, which is expected to boost infrastructure development.\n\nThe government has also launched several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim Asset), which aims to promote economic growth and development through infrastructure investment. Additionally, the country has received funding from international organizations, such as the African Development Bank, to support infrastructure development projects. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure deficits, particularly in rural areas.\n\nZimbabwe's infrastructure faces several challenges, including a lack of maintenance, limited funding, and a shortage of skilled personnel. The country's infrastructure is also vulnerable to climate change, with frequent droughts and floods affecting the availability of water and energy. To address these challenges, the government needs to prioritize infrastructure investment, promote public-private partnerships, and develop strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 97,267 km | Moderate | 19% paved, with many roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 3,427 km | Poor | Limited passenger services, freight services dominant |\n| Airports | 5 international, 10 domestic | Moderate | Major airports include Harare, Bulawayo, and Victoria Falls |\n| Ports | 0, landlocked | N/A | Zimbabwe relies on neighboring countries' ports for international trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Zimbabwe's power generation is primarily based on **thermal power**, with a limited contribution from **hydroelectric power**.\n- The country has experienced frequent **power outages**, due to a combination of factors, including aging infrastructure, limited generation capacity, and high demand.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are being promoted, with several projects underway to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve the **reliability of the grid**, including the rehabilitation of existing power plants and the construction of new ones.\n- **Energy efficiency** measures are being promoted, with a focus on reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of energy-efficient technologies.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in Zimbabwe, with many urban areas experiencing frequent water shortages and contamination.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively low, with many rural areas lacking access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on **traditional water sources**, such as wells and boreholes.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water supply and sanitation**, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the rehabilitation of existing ones.\n- **Wastewater management** is a growing concern, with many urban areas lacking adequate wastewater treatment facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread, with several mobile network operators providing services across the country.\n- **Fiber optic connectivity** is limited, with most internet services relying on **satellite connections** or **copper cables**.\n- The **4G/5G rollout** is underway, with several mobile network operators launching 4G services in major cities.\n- **Postal services** are available, although the use of **digital communication** platforms is becoming increasingly popular.\n- **Internet penetration** is relatively low, with many rural areas lacking access to internet services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Beitbridge-Harare-Chirundu highway** is a major infrastructure project, aimed at improving road connectivity between Zimbabwe and its neighbors.\n- The **Kariba South Hydroelectric Power Station expansion** project aims to increase the country's power generation capacity and reduce its reliance on thermal power.\n- The **National Railways of Zimbabwe rehabilitation** project aims to improve the country's rail network and increase freight and passenger services.\n- The **Zimbabwe-South Africa one-stop border post** project aims to improve trade facilitation and reduce border crossing times.\n- The **China-Zimbabwe cooperation agreement** includes several infrastructure development projects, including the construction of a new parliament building and a **national sports stadium**.",
