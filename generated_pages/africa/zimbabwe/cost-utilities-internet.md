[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Zimbabwe's utility infrastructure quality is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages, especially during the dry season. The costs of utilities in Zimbabwe are fluctuating due to the country's high inflation rate, which was 104.7% in 2022. This means that the prices of utilities can change rapidly, making it challenging for consumers to budget and plan. Additionally, there is a notable seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher electricity and water bills during the summer months when usage is higher.

The Zimbabwean government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the introduction of prepaid electricity meters, which can help consumers manage their energy usage and costs more effectively. However, the overall quality of the utility infrastructure remains a significant challenge, and consumers often have to rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators or solar power, to supplement the grid supply.
