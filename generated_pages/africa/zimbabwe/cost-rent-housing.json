Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Control Act**, which regulates rent increases and provides safeguards against eviction. However, the housing market in Zimbabwe is still recovering from the economic crisis of the early 2000s, and prices can vary greatly depending on the location and condition of the property. Compared to regional neighbors, Zimbabwe's housing costs are relatively high, with prices similar to those in South Africa and higher than those in Zambia and Mozambique.\n\nThe housing market in Zimbabwe is also affected by the country's high **inflation rate**, which can make it difficult for renters to budget and plan for the future. Additionally, the **out-of-pocket health spend** of 10.6% can be a significant burden for renters, who may need to allocate a larger portion of their income towards healthcare expenses. Despite these challenges, Zimbabwe's housing market offers a range of options for renters, from modern apartments in the city center to older houses in the suburbs. With a **GDP per capita (PPP)** of $5,928, Zimbabwe's economy is growing, and the housing market is becoming more attractive to investors and renters alike.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$600 | $150-$300 | typical quality, 1-2 rooms |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$800 | $200-$500 | what to expect, 1-2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,200 | $300-$700 | family size, 2-3 bedrooms, 1-2 bathrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,000-$2,000 | $500-$1,200 | spacious, 3-4 bedrooms, 2-3 bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern apartments |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,500 | residential areas, older houses |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | if applicable, farmhouses or rural properties |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Borrowdale** in Harare: $500-$1,000 per month, a popular suburb with modern amenities and a range of housing options\n- **Mount Pleasant** in Harare: $400-$800 per month, a quiet and secure neighborhood with older houses and a strong sense of community\n- **Avondale** in Harare: $300-$600 per month, a bustling suburb with a mix of older and newer apartments and houses\n- **Chisipite** in Harare: $400-$800 per month, a family-friendly neighborhood with good schools and a range of housing options\n- **Greendale** in Harare: $200-$500 per month, a more affordable suburb with older houses and a strong sense of community\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Zimbabwe [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and prices before starting your search to avoid overpaying for a property\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a property that meets your needs and budget\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms to get the best deal possible\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that you are working with a legitimate landlord or agent\n- Consider the cost of **utilities**, such as electricity and water, which are usually not included in the rent\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Zimbabwe, so be prepared to provide your own furniture and appliances\n- [CALLOUT] Be sure to read and understand the lease agreement before signing, and seek legal advice if necessary\n- [RATING] Zimbabwe's affordability rating: 3/5, due to the relatively high cost of living and housing prices compared to other countries in the region.",
