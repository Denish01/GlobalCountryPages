  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Zimbabwe varies significantly between public and private facilities, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources, while private healthcare is more expensive but offers better services and equipment. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $63 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 10.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 999 or 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: ZWL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nZimbabwe's healthcare system is a mix of public and private facilities, with the public sector providing the majority of healthcare services to the population. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a shortage of medical supplies, equipment, and personnel. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are better equipped and staffed, but are often expensive and out of reach for the average citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. Having health insurance is recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the high costs of private healthcare.\n\nThe healthcare system in Zimbabwe is also plagued by a shortage of medical personnel, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country in search of better opportunities. This has led to a significant brain drain in the healthcare sector, further exacerbating the challenges faced by the public healthcare system. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent private hospitals and medical facilities in Zimbabwe, particularly in the major cities of Harare and Bulawayo. These facilities offer high-quality medical care, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the average citizen.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have long waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private specialists often have more experience and better equipment |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private dental clinics offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Private optometrists often have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs often have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have limited resources and long waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations and better care |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Private hospitals have more experienced surgeons and better equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$200 | Private hospitals offer more comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private hospitals have more advanced imaging equipment |\n| X-Ray | $10-$30 | Public hospitals often have older equipment and longer waiting times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Covers public hospital visits, basic medical procedures, and some medications |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers private hospital visits, specialist consultations, and more comprehensive medical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers international hospital visits, evacuations, and more comprehensive medical procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **painkillers** are widely available in Zimbabwe, but may be in short supply in public hospitals.\n- **Prescription medications** often require a doctor's prescription, and prices can vary significantly between public and private pharmacies.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in major cities, but can be limited in rural areas.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available, but prices can be high.\n- **Generic medications** are often cheaper than brand-name medications, but may not always be available.\n- **Medication prices** can vary significantly between public and private pharmacies, with private pharmacies often charging more.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number (999 or 112) or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Public hospitals often have limited resources and long waiting times, so it is recommended to seek private medical care if possible. There are several excellent private hospitals in Zimbabwe, particularly in the major cities of Harare and Bulawayo, which offer high-quality emergency care. These hospitals often have **24-hour emergency rooms**, **intensive care units**, and **specialist doctors** on call.
