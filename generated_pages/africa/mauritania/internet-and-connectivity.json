  "content": "The internet in Mauritania is generally limited, with slow speeds and a lack of reliable connectivity, especially outside of the capital city of Nouakchott. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Mauritel, Chinguitel, Mattel\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Mauritania is still developing, with a significant urban-rural divide in terms of access and quality. In the capital city of Nouakchott, internet speeds are generally faster and more reliable, but outside of the city, connectivity can be slow and unreliable. This can make it difficult for travelers and remote workers to stay connected, especially in rural areas. The country's internet infrastructure is largely based on mobile networks, with limited fiber-optic connectivity, which contributes to the slow speeds and lack of reliability.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Mauritania can also be affected by power outages and network congestion, especially during peak hours. This can make it challenging to access online services, communicate with family and friends, or work remotely. However, the government has been investing in improving the country's internet infrastructure, including the development of a national fiber-optic network, which is expected to improve internet speeds and reliability in the coming years.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Mauritania, travelers can visit one of the main carriers, such as Mauritel, Chinguitel, or Mattel, at their offices or authorized retailers. To purchase a SIM card, travelers will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, such as a hotel reservation or a letter from their employer. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans are available starting from 5 USD per month for 1 GB of data. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as some smaller operators may have limited coverage and reliability.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mauritel | Prepaid | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Chinguitel | Tourist Plan | 2 GB | 10 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Mattel | Data Plan | 5 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Mauritel | Monthly Plan | 10 GB | 30 | Auto-renewal available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels offering free WiFi to their guests, but speeds can be slow and unreliable.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not well-developed in Mauritania, with limited options for WiFi in cafes and restaurants, especially outside of Nouakchott.\n- Coworking spaces are available in Nouakchott, offering reliable WiFi and a productive work environment, but options are limited in other cities.\n- Public WiFi is not widely available in Mauritania, and when available, it is often slow and unreliable.\n- Some restaurants and cafes in tourist areas may offer free WiFi, but it is not always available or reliable.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces in Nouakchott, such as the Mauritania Coworking Space, offer reliable WiFi and a productive work environment.\n- Reliable cafe chains, such as the Cafe de la Paix, offer good WiFi and a comfortable work environment, but options are limited.\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots or satellite internet, may be necessary for remote workers, especially in rural areas.\n- VPNs may be necessary to access certain websites or services, as some may be blocked by the government.\n- Remote workers may also consider purchasing a local SIM card with a data plan to stay connected, especially when traveling outside of Nouakchott.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Mauritania, with some websites and services blocked by the government, including social media and news sites.\n- Some websites and services may be blocked due to **content filtering**, and a VPN may be necessary to access them.\n- Roaming alternatives, such as purchasing a local SIM card or using a mobile hotspot, may be more cost-effective than roaming with a foreign carrier.\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Mauritania, and travelers may need to purchase a physical SIM card.\n- Travelers should be aware of their data usage and avoid using public WiFi for sensitive activities, such as online banking or shopping, due to security concerns.\n- Remote workers should research their options carefully and plan ahead to ensure reliable internet access, especially in rural areas.",
