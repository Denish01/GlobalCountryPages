[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritania's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The country has a **National Health Policy** that aims to improve healthcare access and quality, but the implementation of this policy is often hindered by limited resources and infrastructure. In urban areas, such as the capital city Nouakchott, there are more healthcare options available, including private clinics and hospitals, but in rural areas, access to healthcare is often limited to basic primary care services. The quality of care in Mauritania is also a concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals.

The public healthcare system in Mauritania is **underfunded** and **understaffed**, which can result in long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality care, but at a higher cost, making it inaccessible to many Mauritarians. The government has implemented initiatives to improve healthcare access, including the introduction of **community health workers** and **mobile health clinics**, but more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country.

Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system in Mauritania, including investments in **health infrastructure** and **health workforce development**. However, more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited.
