The rental market is relatively unregulated, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months. Deposits are usually required, equivalent to 1-2 months' rent, and tenant rights are limited. Compared to its regional neighbors, Mauritania's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in countries like Senegal but higher than in Mali. The government has implemented initiatives to increase access to affordable housing, but the market remains largely informal.\n\nThe housing market in Mauritania is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a GDP per capita of $7,369 and an inflation rate of 2.5%. The education and health sectors also play a role in shaping the housing market, with 4.7% of GDP spent on education and $92 per capita spent on health. The out-of-pocket health expenditure is 43.8%, which may impact the affordability of housing for some individuals. Overall, Mauritania's housing market offers a range of options for renters and buyers, from modern apartments in the city center to traditional houses in the suburbs.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $150-$300 | basic amenities, 1-2 rooms |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $200-$400 | 1-2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, kitchen |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $300-$600 | 2-3 bedrooms, 1-2 bathrooms, living room |\n| 3 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | 3-4 bedrooms, 2-3 bathrooms, spacious living areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, traditional houses |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | agricultural areas, basic infrastructure |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Tevragh Zeina**: a modern neighborhood with high-end apartments, $500-$1,000 per month\n- **Riyad**: a popular area for expats, with a range of housing options, $300-$700 per month\n- **Dar Naim**: a residential neighborhood with traditional houses, $200-$500 per month\n- **Sebkha**: a coastal area with modern apartments, $400-$900 per month\n- **Nouakchott Ville**: the city center, with a mix of modern and traditional housing, $300-$800 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Mauritania [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a reliable landlord\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease to avoid any potential issues\n- Negotiate the rent and deposit with the landlord, as prices may be flexible\n- Be aware of scams and fake listings, and never pay a deposit without a signed contract\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget",
