Mauritania has a relatively more diversified economy, with a mix of agriculture, mining, and fishing industries, while Western Sahara's economy is largely based on phosphate mining and fishing. The cost of living in Mauritania is generally lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more affordable. On the other hand, Western Sahara has a more limited market, which can drive up prices for certain goods and services.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Mauritania has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, ports, and communication networks, which facilitates trade and commerce. In contrast, Western Sahara's infrastructure is more limited, which can make it more expensive to import goods and services. Overall, Mauritania offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a cost of living that is around 15-20% lower than Western Sahara.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritania (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritania (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritania (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritania (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mauritania (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 700 | 29% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mauritania is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices being 30-40% lower\n- Food and dining, with meal prices being 50% lower\n- Transportation, with fuel and taxi prices being 33-50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices being 37-50% lower\n- **Western Sahara is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, which may be more readily available due to its coastal location\n- Tourism-related activities, such as guided tours and outdoor excursions\n- High-end accommodations and dining, which may be more developed in Western Sahara\n- Certain business services, such as logistics and trade facilitation\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMauritania offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a cost of living that is around 15-20% lower than Western Sahara.
