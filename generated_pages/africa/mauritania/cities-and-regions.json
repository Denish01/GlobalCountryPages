Each wilaya is further divided into departments, which are then subdivided into communes. The country's administrative structure is designed to provide a framework for governance and development at the local level. The 12 wilayas are Adrar, Assaba, Brakna, Dakhlet Nouadhibou, Gorgol, Guidimaka, Hodh Ech Chargui, Hodh El Gharbi, Inchiri, Nouakchott, Tagant, and Tiris Zemmour.\n\nThe capital district of Nouakchott is a separate administrative entity, with its own governor and administration. The country's regions are diverse, with varying climates, cultures, and economic activities. The northern regions are primarily desert, while the southern regions are more fertile and support agriculture.

The country has several domestic airports, with flights connecting major cities such as Nouakchott, Nouadhibou, and Néma. There are also bus services connecting major cities, but these can be slow and unreliable. The country's roads are often in poor condition, and driving can be challenging, especially during the rainy season. However, the country's scenic coastline and desert landscapes make it an attractive destination for adventurous travelers. \n\nThe best way to get around Mauritania is by car, either by renting a vehicle or hiring a driver. This allows for flexibility and the ability to explore the country's rural areas and scenic landscapes. However, it's essential to be aware of the country's security situation and to take necessary precautions when traveling, especially in the northern regions. [CALLOUT] Travelers should exercise caution when traveling in Mauritania, especially in areas near the border with Western Sahara and Mali, due to the risk of banditry and terrorism.",
