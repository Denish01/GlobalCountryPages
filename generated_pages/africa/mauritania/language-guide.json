The country is home to several regional dialects, including Hassaniya Arabic, which is widely spoken in the north, and Zenaga, a Berber language spoken by the Zenaga people. Minority languages such as Wolof and Soninke are also spoken in various parts of the country, particularly in the south. English is not widely spoken in Mauritania, and proficiency is generally very low, especially outside of major cities like Nouakchott. However, some locals in the tourism industry and younger generations may have a basic understanding of English.\n\nThe linguistic diversity of Mauritania is also reflected in the country's cultural heritage, with many locals speaking multiple languages. For example, in the capital city of Nouakchott, it is common to hear **Arabic**, French, and Wolof being spoken in the same conversation. This linguistic diversity has contributed to the country's rich cultural identity and has played an important role in shaping its history and traditions.\n\nIn terms of language use, **Arabic** is the dominant language in most aspects of Mauritanian life, including government, education, and media. However, French is also widely used, particularly in business and commerce, and is often used as a lingua franca among locals who speak different languages. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Mauritania is complex and diverse, reflecting the country's strategic location at the crossroads of Africa and the Arab world.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | As-salamu alaykum | Ah-sah-lah-moo ah-lay-koom | Formal |\n| Hello | Marhaba | Mar-hah-bah | Informal |\n| Thank you | Shukraan | Shoo-krah-n | Formal |\n| Please | Afwan | Ahf-wahn | Formal |\n| Yes / No | Na'am / La | Nah-am / Lah | Formal |\n| Excuse me | A'udhu billahi | Ah-oo-dhoo bee-lah-hee | Formal |\n| How much? | Kam? | Kahm | Formal |\n| Where is...? | Ayn...? | Ay-n... | Formal |\n| I don't understand | La afham | Lah ah-fahm | Formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Hal tatakallam al-ingliziyya? | Hahl tah-tah-kah-lahm al-een-glee-zee-yah | Formal |\n| Help! | Musa'ada! | Moo-sah-ah-dah | Formal |\n| Goodbye | Ma'a as-salaama | Mah-ah ah-sah-lah-mah | Formal |\n| Sorry | Aasif | Ah-see-f | Formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Wahid | Wah-heed |\n| 2 | Ithnayn | Ee-thnayn |\n| 3 | Thalatha | Thah-lah-thah |\n| 4 | Arba'a | Ah-rbah-ah |\n| 5 | Khamsa | Khahm-sah |\n| 6 | Sitta | See-tah |\n| 7 | Sab'a | Sah-bah |\n| 8 | Thamaaniya | Thah-mah-nee-yah |\n| 9 | Tis'a | Tee-sah |\n| 10 | Ashara | Ah-shah-rah |\n| 100 | Mi'a | Mee-ah |\n| 1000 | Alf | Ahlf |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, and avoid using **body language** that may be considered offensive, such as pointing with the left hand or touching someone's head.\n- Avoid **gestures** that may be considered rude, such as blowing one's nose in public or eating with the left hand.\n- **Formality** is highly valued in Mauritanian culture, and visitors should address locals with respect and deference, using titles such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" and avoiding familiar language.\n- When **bargaining**, be patient and respectful, and avoid aggressive or confrontational behavior.\n- Learn a few basic **Arabic phrases**, such as \"As-salamu alaykum\" (hello) and \"Shukraan\" (thank you), to show respect for the local culture.\n- Avoid **public displays of affection**, as these may be considered impolite or even offensive.\n- Be mindful of **dressing modestly**, covering one's shoulders and knees, and avoiding revealing clothing.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- **Google Translate** is a useful app for translating **Arabic** text and speech, and can be downloaded on most smartphones.\n- **Phrasebooks** and **language guides** can be purchased at most bookstores or online, and can provide valuable insights into the local language and culture.\n- **Language learning apps**, such as Duolingo, can be a useful resource for visitors who want to learn basic **Arabic phrases** before their trip.\n- **Local guides** and **tour operators** can provide valuable assistance with communication and navigation, and can help visitors to avoid cultural faux pas.\n- **Embassy websites** and **travel advisories** can provide useful information on safety and security, as well as cultural norms and customs, and can be a valuable resource for visitors to Mauritania.",
