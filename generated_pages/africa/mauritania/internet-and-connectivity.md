[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Mauritania is still developing, with a significant urban-rural divide in terms of access and quality. In the capital city of Nouakchott, internet speeds are generally faster and more reliable, but outside of the city, connectivity can be slow and unreliable. This can make it difficult for travelers and remote workers to stay connected, especially in rural areas. The country's internet infrastructure is largely based on mobile networks, with limited fiber-optic connectivity, which contributes to the slow speeds and lack of reliability.

The reliability of the internet in Mauritania can also be affected by power outages and network congestion, especially during peak hours. This can make it challenging to access online services, communicate with family and friends, or work remotely. However, the government has been investing in improving the country's internet infrastructure, including the development of a national fiber-optic network, which is expected to improve internet speeds and reliability in the coming years.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Mauritania, travelers can visit one of the main carriers, such as Mauritel, Chinguitel, or Mattel, at their offices or authorized retailers. To purchase a SIM card, travelers will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, such as a hotel reservation or a letter from their employer. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans are available starting from 5 USD per month for 1 GB of data. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as some smaller operators may have limited coverage and reliability.
