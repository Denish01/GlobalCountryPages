[SECTION] Overview: Mauritania vs Senegal [/SECTION]
Mauritania and Senegal are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost structures. Mauritania has a relatively low GDP per capita and a high inflation rate, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Senegal has a more diversified economy and a higher GDP per capita, resulting in higher prices for goods and services. Overall, Mauritania is a more affordable option for expats, students, and travelers, with a cost of living that is around 15-20% lower than in Senegal.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost structures. Mauritania's economy is heavily reliant on natural resources, such as iron ore and fish, while Senegal has a more diversified economy with a strong services sector. This diversification has contributed to Senegal's higher cost of living, particularly in urban areas like Dakar. In contrast, Mauritania's capital city, Nouakchott, has a more relaxed and affordable atmosphere, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.
