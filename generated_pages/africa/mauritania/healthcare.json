  "content": "Healthcare in Mauritania is a mixed system that faces significant challenges, including limited access to quality care, especially in rural areas, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 117\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nMauritania's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The country has a **National Health Policy** that aims to improve healthcare access and quality, but the implementation of this policy is often hindered by limited resources and infrastructure. In urban areas, such as the capital city Nouakchott, there are more healthcare options available, including private clinics and hospitals, but in rural areas, access to healthcare is often limited to basic primary care services. The quality of care in Mauritania is also a concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Mauritania is **underfunded** and **understaffed**, which can result in long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality care, but at a higher cost, making it inaccessible to many Mauritarians. The government has implemented initiatives to improve healthcare access, including the introduction of **community health workers** and **mobile health clinics**, but more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system in Mauritania, including investments in **health infrastructure** and **health workforce development**. However, more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nouakchott Hospital | Nouakchott | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Centre Hospitalier National | Nouakchott | Public | Specialized care, including cardiology and oncology | Limited |\n| Clinique du Plateau | Nouakchott | Private | General medicine, surgery, dentistry | Yes |\n| Polyclinique de Nouakchott | Nouakchott | Private | General medicine, surgery, specialized care | Yes |\n| Hospital de Aleg | Aleg | Public | General medicine, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Centre de Santé de Kaédi | Kaédi | Public | Primary care, maternal and child health | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for expats and foreigners, as it provides access to better quality care and more comprehensive coverage.\n- **Local health insurance options** are limited, but some private insurance companies offer plans that cover basic medical expenses.\n- **Expats** should consider purchasing international health insurance that covers them in Mauritania and other countries.\n- **Costs** of health insurance vary depending on the provider and the level of coverage, but expect to pay around $500-1000 per year for a basic plan.\n- **Government-sponsored health insurance** is available for citizens, but it has limited coverage and is often underfunded.\n- **Supplementary insurance** may be necessary to cover additional expenses, such as dental care and specialized treatments.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are available in major cities, but the selection may be limited, and quality can vary.\n- **Prescription requirements** are often lax, and many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, but generic options may be more affordable.\n- **Costs** of medications vary depending on the type and brand, but expect to pay around 10-20% of the cost of medications in Western countries.\n- **Pharmacy access** is limited in rural areas, where patients may have to travel long distances to access basic medications.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for all travelers to Mauritania.\n- **Hepatitis A and B vaccinations** are recommended for all travelers.\n- **Typhoid vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Malaria** is a significant health risk in Mauritania, particularly in rural areas, and travelers should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking tap water and stick to bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat and raw vegetables.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Mauritania, and travelers are not recommended to seek medical care in the country unless absolutely necessary.\n- **Basic medical procedures** may be available in major cities, but specialized care is often limited.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are few, and quality of care can vary significantly.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for basic medical procedures, but the risks associated with seeking medical care in Mauritania often outweigh the potential cost savings.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In case of an emergency**, call the emergency number 117 or seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is limited, and travelers may need to rely on private transportation to get to a hospital.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be far away, particularly in rural areas, and travelers should be prepared for long wait times and limited access to medical care.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, and travelers should be sure to keep all medical records and receipts to facilitate the claims process.\n- **Emergency evacuation** may be necessary in severe cases, and travelers should consider purchasing evacuation insurance to cover the costs of emergency transportation.",
