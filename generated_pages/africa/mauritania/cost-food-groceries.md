[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritania's food prices are generally higher than the regional average due to its landlocked location and reliance on imports. The country's **inflation rate** of 2.5% in 2024 also contributes to the increasing cost of food. However, the **GDP per capita PPP** of $7,369 in 2024 indicates a relatively stable economy, which can help mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. Eating out is not a common practice in Mauritania, and most people prefer to cook at home. This is partly due to the limited number of restaurants, especially outside of Nouakchott, and the relatively high cost of dining out.

The **out-of-pocket health spend** of 43.8% in 2023 is a significant burden for many households, which can affect their ability to afford food and other essential items. As a result, many people in Mauritania rely on traditional and locally sourced ingredients to prepare their meals. The **education spend** of 4.7% of GDP in 2023 is also relatively low, which can limit access to information about healthy eating and nutrition. Despite these challenges, the country's cuisine is rich and diverse, with a focus on **meat**, **vegetables**, and **grains**. Popular dishes include **thieboudienne**, a hearty fish and rice stew, and **mechui**, a slow-cooked meat dish.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Mauritania. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, but they offer a wider range of products, including imported goods. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional ingredients at lower prices. However, the quality and availability of products can vary greatly depending on the market and the season. It is generally recommended to buy **fresh produce** and **meat** at local markets, while **canned goods** and **imported products** are often cheaper at supermarkets.

When shopping at local markets, it is common to **haggle** over prices, especially for bulk purchases. This can help to reduce the cost of groceries and is an integral part of the local shopping culture. However, it is essential to be respectful and fair when negotiating prices, as the sellers are often small-scale farmers or traders who rely on their daily sales to make a living. In contrast, supermarkets tend to have fixed prices, and haggling is not common.
