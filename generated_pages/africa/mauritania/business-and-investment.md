[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Mauritania's business environment is characterized by a complex bureaucracy and a relatively unstable political climate.

The country has a relatively small but growing economy, with a strong focus on **extractive industries** such as mining and oil. The government's attitude towards foreign investment is generally positive, with efforts to promote investment in key sectors and provide incentives for foreign investors.

The level of bureaucracy in Mauritania can be a significant obstacle for businesses, with complex and time-consuming procedures for registering and operating a business.
