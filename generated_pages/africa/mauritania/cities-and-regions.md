Mauritania has a limited transportation network, with few paved roads and limited public transportation. The country has several domestic airports, with flights connecting major cities such as Nouakchott, Nouadhibou, and Néma. There are also bus services connecting major cities, but these can be slow and unreliable. The country's roads are often in poor condition, and driving can be challenging, especially during the rainy season. However, the country's scenic coastline and desert landscapes make it an attractive destination for adventurous travelers. 

The best way to get around Mauritania is by car, either by renting a vehicle or hiring a driver. This allows for flexibility and the ability to explore the country's rural areas and scenic landscapes. However, it's essential to be aware of the country's security situation and to take necessary precautions when traveling, especially in the northern regions. [CALLOUT] Travelers should exercise caution when traveling in Mauritania, especially in areas near the border with Western Sahara and Mali, due to the risk of banditry and terrorism.
