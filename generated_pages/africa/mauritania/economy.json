The country has a developing economy, with a strong focus on primary industries such as mining and fishing. The economy is also heavily reliant on foreign aid and investment, particularly from countries such as China and the European Union. Despite its natural resources, Mauritania remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a significant portion of its population living below the poverty line.\n\nMauritania's economic development has been hindered by a number of factors, including a lack of infrastructure, a small and underdeveloped private sector, and a reliance on a few primary industries. The country has also faced significant challenges related to climate change, including drought and desertification, which have had a major impact on its agricultural sector. However, the government has been working to diversify the economy and attract foreign investment, with a focus on developing its mining and tourism sectors.\n\nIn recent years, Mauritania has made significant progress in terms of economic growth, with GDP growth averaging around 3-4% per year. The country has also made efforts to improve its business environment, including the introduction of new laws and regulations to encourage foreign investment. However, significant challenges remain, including a lack of infrastructure and a highly bureaucratic business environment.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mining | 20% of GDP | Iron ore, copper, and gold are the main minerals extracted |\n| Fishing | 15% of GDP | Mauritania has a significant fishing industry, with a focus on exports to Europe and Asia |\n| Agriculture | 10% of GDP | The country's agricultural sector is focused on subsistence farming, with crops such as millet, sorghum, and dates |\n| Manufacturing | 5% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is small, with a focus on food processing and textiles |\n| Services | 50% of GDP | The services sector is the largest sector of the economy, with a focus on trade, transport, and finance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Iron ore**: Mauritania is a significant producer of iron ore, with exports primarily going to China and Europe\n- **Fish and seafood**: The country's fishing industry is a major export earner, with a focus on high-value species such as shrimp and lobster\n- **Copper**: Mauritania is also a producer of copper, with exports primarily going to Europe and Asia\n- **Gold**: The country has significant gold reserves, with exports primarily going to Europe and the Middle East\n- **Livestock**: Mauritania exports livestock, particularly cattle and sheep, to countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Foodstuffs**: Mauritania imports a significant amount of food, particularly rice, wheat, and sugar\n- **Fuel**: The country imports a significant amount of fuel, particularly diesel and gasoline\n- **Machinery**: Mauritania imports machinery, particularly for the mining and fishing sectors\n- **Textiles**: The country imports textiles, particularly clothing and fabric\n- **Electronics**: Mauritania imports electronics, particularly mobile phones and computers\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: Mauritania's largest trading partner, with significant imports of machinery and exports of iron ore\n- France: A significant trading partner, with imports of foodstuffs and exports of fish and seafood\n- Spain: A key trading partner, with imports of machinery and exports of fish and seafood\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country has a relatively underdeveloped transport network, with a focus on roads and ports\n- Mauritania has significant energy challenges, with a reliance on imported fuel and a lack of access to electricity in rural areas\n- The country has a relatively low level of internet and mobile penetration, with around 20% of the population having access to the internet\n- Mauritania has a number of ports, including the Port of Nouakchott and the Port of Nouadhibou, which are significant for trade and commerce\n- The country has a number of airports, including the Nouakchott International Airport, which is a key hub for trade and tourism\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nMauritania's economic outlook is positive, with the country expected to continue to experience modest growth in the coming years.

The country will need to continue to work to improve its business environment and attract foreign investment in order to achieve its development goals.\n\nIn the short term, Mauritania's economy is expected to be driven by the mining and fishing sectors, with significant investment in these areas expected to drive growth. The country is also expected to benefit from significant investment in its infrastructure, including the development of new ports and roads. However, the country will need to be careful to manage its natural resources sustainably, and to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared equitably among the population.
