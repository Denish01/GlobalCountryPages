[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritania operates a **territorial tax system**, where only income earned within the country is subject to tax, regardless of the taxpayer's residence. However, residents are also taxed on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid abroad. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must have a permanent home in Mauritania, or spend more than 183 days in the country within a 12-month period.

The tax system in Mauritania is relatively complex, with different tax rates and rules applying to different types of income. The country has a relatively small tax treaty network, which can lead to double taxation for individuals and businesses with international connections. However, Mauritania is a member of several regional economic organizations, which can provide some relief from double taxation.
