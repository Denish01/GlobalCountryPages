  "content": "Mauritania is generally cheaper than Senegal, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMauritania GDP per Capita (PPP): $4,300\nSenegal GDP per Capita (PPP): $4,700\nMauritania Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nSenegal Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Mauritania\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Mauritania vs Senegal [/SECTION]\nMauritania and Senegal are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost structures. Mauritania has a relatively low GDP per capita and a high inflation rate, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Senegal has a more diversified economy and a higher GDP per capita, resulting in higher prices for goods and services. Overall, Mauritania is a more affordable option for expats, students, and travelers, with a cost of living that is around 15-20% lower than in Senegal.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost structures. Mauritania's economy is heavily reliant on natural resources, such as iron ore and fish, while Senegal has a more diversified economy with a strong services sector. This diversification has contributed to Senegal's higher cost of living, particularly in urban areas like Dakar. In contrast, Mauritania's capital city, Nouakchott, has a more relaxed and affordable atmosphere, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritania (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritania (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritania (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritania (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $30 | $50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mauritania (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $500 | $700 | 29% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,500 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mauritania is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 30-40% lower than in Senegal\n- Food and dining, with meal prices that are 50% lower than in Senegal\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices that are 30-50% lower than in Senegal\n- Utilities and internet, with prices that are 30-50% lower than in Senegal\n- **Senegal is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, such as electronics and clothing, which are often cheaper in Senegal due to its more developed trade networks\n- Healthcare, with better-equipped hospitals and medical facilities in Senegal\n- Education, with a more developed education system and a wider range of international schools in Senegal\n- Tourist attractions, with a wider range of cultural and historical sites in Senegal\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMauritania offers better value for expats, students, and travelers who are looking for an affordable and relaxed lifestyle.
