  "content": "Mauritania's infrastructure is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in roads, power, and water supply, particularly in rural areas, but the country has been investing in recent years to improve its overall infrastructure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 42% of population\nInternet Penetration: 22%\nRoad Network: 10,692 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: 717 km\nMajor Airports: 5\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMauritania's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has been investing in its infrastructure, with a focus on improving roads, increasing access to electricity, and expanding its port facilities. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on promoting economic growth and reducing poverty.\n\nDespite these challenges, Mauritania has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in its infrastructure totaling over $1 billion in 2020. The country has also received support from international donors, including the World Bank and the African Development Bank, to help finance its infrastructure development plans. These investments have helped to improve the country's business environment and attract foreign investment, which is expected to drive economic growth in the coming years.\n\nMauritania's infrastructure development plans are focused on promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, with a focus on improving access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has also been working to promote the development of its mining and fishing industries, which are expected to drive economic growth in the coming years. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled labor and limited access to finance, which are expected to hinder its ability to achieve its development goals.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 10,692 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved and in need of maintenance |\n| Railways | 717 km | Moderate | Limited network, but plans for expansion |\n| Airports | 5 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, but limited connections |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | Well-equipped, but limited capacity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Mauritania's power generation is mostly based on **thermal power**, with a limited contribution from **renewable energy** sources.\n- The country's electricity grid is unreliable, with frequent **power outages** and a lack of access to electricity in rural areas.\n- The government has been working to improve the reliability of the grid, with plans to increase the use of **renewable energy** sources, such as **solar** and **wind power**.\n- Mauritania has also been exploring the development of its **oil and gas** resources, which are expected to help increase the country's energy independence.\n- The country has set a goal of increasing access to electricity to 80% of the population by 2025, with a focus on promoting the use of **off-grid** energy solutions in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Mauritania's **tap water** is not always safe to drink, with a high risk of **water-borne diseases**.\n- The country's **sanitation** coverage is limited, with many households lacking access to **toilets** and other sanitation facilities.\n- The government has been working to improve access to **clean water** and **sanitation**, with a focus on promoting the use of **rainwater harvesting** and **waste management** systems.\n- Mauritania has also been investing in its **irrigation** systems, with a focus on promoting the development of its **agriculture** sector.\n- The country has set a goal of increasing access to **clean water** and **sanitation** to 90% of the population by 2030, with a focus on promoting the use of **community-based** water and sanitation systems.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mauritania's **mobile coverage** is relatively good, with coverage available in most urban areas.\n- The country's **fiber** and **broadband** networks are limited, with a focus on promoting the development of its **ICT** sector.\n- Mauritania has been investing in its **4G** and **5G** networks, with a focus on promoting the use of **mobile broadband** services.\n- The country's **postal services** are limited, with a focus on promoting the use of **digital** payment systems.\n- Mauritania has set a goal of increasing access to **internet** services to 50% of the population by 2025, with a focus on promoting the use of **community-based** internet services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Nouakchott Port** expansion project, which is expected to increase the port's capacity and promote the development of the country's **trade** sector.\n- The **Mauritania Railway** project, which is expected to improve the country's **transport** infrastructure and promote the development of its **mining** sector.\n- The **Nouakchott Power Plant** project, which is expected to increase the country's **energy** independence and promote the development of its **industry** sector.\n- The **Mauritania Water Supply** project, which is expected to improve access to **clean water** and **sanitation** in rural areas.\n- The **Mauritania ICT** project, which is expected to promote the development of the country's **ICT** sector and increase access to **internet** services.",
