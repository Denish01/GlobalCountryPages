[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritania's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has been investing in its infrastructure, with a focus on improving roads, increasing access to electricity, and expanding its port facilities. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on promoting economic growth and reducing poverty.

Despite these challenges, Mauritania has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in its infrastructure totaling over $1 billion in 2020. The country has also received support from international donors, including the World Bank and the African Development Bank, to help finance its infrastructure development plans. These investments have helped to improve the country's business environment and attract foreign investment, which is expected to drive economic growth in the coming years.

Mauritania's infrastructure development plans are focused on promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, with a focus on improving access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has also been working to promote the development of its mining and fishing industries, which are expected to drive economic growth in the coming years. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled labor and limited access to finance, which are expected to hinder its ability to achieve its development goals.
