[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritania's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. The quality of education in public schools is generally lower than in private schools, with limited resources and outdated teaching methods. The language of instruction is Arabic, with French being taught as a secondary language. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are available in the capital city, Nouakchott, and offer a range of curricula, including French, British, and American.

The education system in Mauritania faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing new curricula. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, with better resources and more qualified teachers, but are generally expensive and out of reach for most Mauritians.
