The market is largely driven by the country's growing economy, which is fueled by its natural resources, including iron ore, fish, and oil. As a result, there is a high demand for housing, particularly in urban areas such as Nouakchott, the capital city. The price trajectory of properties in Mauritania is generally upward, with prices increasing by around 10% per year. However, the market can be volatile, and prices may fluctuate depending on factors such as government policies and global economic trends. Urban areas tend to have higher property prices compared to rural areas, where prices are generally lower.\n\nThe property market in Mauritania is also influenced by the country's cultural and social factors. For example, many Mauritarians prefer to live in traditional houses made of mud or concrete, which can be more affordable than modern apartments. Additionally, the concept of **ownership** is often tied to social status, and owning a property is seen as a symbol of wealth and prosperity. As a result, there is a high demand for properties in desirable areas, particularly in Nouakchott, where the government and many businesses are located.\n\nDespite the challenges, the property market in Mauritania offers opportunities for investment and development. The government has implemented policies to encourage foreign investment, including the creation of free trade zones and tax incentives for businesses. Additionally, the country's growing economy and increasing demand for housing make it an attractive market for property developers and investors.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nouakchott | 600 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Nouadhibou | 400 | 150 | House |\n| Zouerate | 300 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Kaedi | 250 | 80 | House |\n| Kiffa | 200 | 60 | Apartment |\n| Néma | 150 | 40 | House |\n| Atar | 100 | 30 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Mauritania, but they must obtain a **permit** from the Ministry of Justice, which can be a lengthy and bureaucratic process.\n- Foreigners are restricted from buying property in certain areas, such as near military bases or in sensitive border regions.\n- Foreigners can set up a **company** in Mauritania to buy property, which can provide more flexibility and tax benefits.\n- Foreigners must pay a **registration fee** of around 10% of the property's value to register the property in their name.\n- Foreigners must also obtain a **residence permit** to live in Mauritania, which can be tied to the ownership of a property.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
