[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritania has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated equipment, while private healthcare providers offer higher quality services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, due to the high costs of private healthcare. However, for foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred choice, as it offers better quality care and shorter waiting times. It is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare, as the costs can be prohibitively expensive without it.

The healthcare system in Mauritania is also hampered by a lack of skilled healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. Many healthcare professionals migrate to other countries in search of better pay and working conditions, leaving a shortage of skilled staff in Mauritania. This can make it difficult for patients to access quality healthcare, particularly in emergency situations. Despite these challenges, there are some good quality private hospitals and clinics in the capital city, Nouakchott, which offer a range of services, including emergency care, surgery, and maternity services.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Prescription medication can be expensive, with prices ranging from $5 to $50 per month, depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.
- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, but prices can vary depending on the pharmacy and the location.
- Some pharmacies in Nouakchott offer a wide range of medications, including imported brands, while others may have limited supplies.
- It is recommended to bring any prescription medication with you when traveling to Mauritania, as it may not be available locally.
- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked with basic medications, such as painkillers and antibiotics.
- It is recommended to check the expiration dates of any medication before purchasing, as some pharmacies may sell expired or counterfeit medication.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number, 117, or to go to the nearest hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private hospitals, which have more modern facilities and skilled staff. However, these hospitals can be expensive, and it is recommended to have some form of health insurance to cover the costs. The **Centre Hospitalier National** in Nouakchott is one of the best public hospitals in the country, but it can be overcrowded and understaffed. Private hospitals, such as the **Clinique du Nord**, offer better quality care, but at a higher cost. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuation, as the healthcare system in Mauritania may not be able to provide the level of care required in serious emergency situations.
