The cuisine is characterized by the use of fresh fish from the coast, meat from the interior, and dates, which are abundant in the country. The national dish, **Thieboudienne**, is a hearty fish and rice dish that is often served on special occasions. Regional variations in cuisine exist, with the coastal regions favoring fish and seafood, while the interior regions favor meat and dates.\n\nThe country's cuisine has also been influenced by its history of trade and cultural exchange with other countries, including Morocco, Algeria, and France. As a result, many Mauritanian dishes have been adapted from other cuisines, with local ingredients and spices added to create a unique flavor. For example, **Maafe**, a rich meat stew, is a popular dish that originated in West Africa but has been adapted in Mauritania with local ingredients such as lamb and dates.\n\nIn Mauritania, mealtimes are often social occasions, with families and friends gathering to share food and conversation. The traditional **Mechoui**, a whole roasted sheep, is often served on special occasions such as weddings and holidays. The country's cuisine is also known for its use of aromatic spices, including cumin, coriander, and cinnamon, which add flavor and depth to many dishes.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thieboudienne | Fish and rice dish | Hearty fish and rice dish with vegetables and spices | Coastal restaurants |\n| Maafe | Meat stew | Rich lamb stew with vegetables and spices | Interior restaurants |\n| Mechoui | Roasted meat | Whole roasted sheep with spices and herbs | Special occasion venues |\n| Akara | Fried doughnuts | Fried doughnuts made with peanuts and honey | Street food vendors |\n| Yassa | Grilled meat | Grilled meat dish with onions, peppers, and spices | Street food vendors |\n| Couscous | Steamed semolina | Steamed semolina dish with meat, vegetables, and spices | Traditional restaurants |\n| Harira | Soup | Hearty soup made with lentils, tomatoes, and spices | Street food vendors |\n| Shakshuka | Egg dish | Eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce | Breakfast restaurants |\n| Msir | Stew | Hearty stew made with meat, vegetables, and spices | Interior restaurants |\n| Baguette avec Fromage | Sandwich | Grilled baguette with cheese and spices | Street food vendors |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Akara**, fried doughnuts made with peanuts and honey, $1-$2 USD\n- **Yassa**, grilled meat dish with onions, peppers, and spices, $3-$5 USD\n- **Harira**, hearty soup made with lentils, tomatoes, and spices, $2-$3 USD\n- **Msir**, hearty stew made with meat, vegetables, and spices, $3-$5 USD\n- **Baguette avec Fromage**, grilled baguette with cheese and spices, $2-$3 USD\n- **Fresh fruit**, including dates, oranges, and bananas, $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Mauritanian tea**, a sweet and spicy tea made with green tea and spices, $1-$2 USD\n- **Fresh juice**, including orange, mango, and grapefruit, $2-$3 USD\n- **Sahara beer**, a local beer made with malted barley and hops, $3-$5 USD\n- **Ginger beer**, a spicy and refreshing drink made with ginger and lemon, $2-$3 USD\n- **Fresh water**, $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with the right hand**, as the left hand is considered unclean\n- **Respecting Ramadan**, the Islamic holy month of fasting, by not eating in public during the day\n- **Tipping**, 5-10% of the total bill, as a sign of appreciation for good service\n- **Dress code**, modest dress, including covering the shoulders and knees, as a sign of respect for local customs\n- **Reservation culture**, not necessary, but recommended for large groups or special occasions\n- **Eating etiquette**, waiting for the host to start eating before beginning, and not leaving the table until everyone has finished\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional restaurants**, serving local dishes such as **Thieboudienne** and **Maafe**\n- **Street food vendors**, serving snacks and drinks such as **Akara** and **Yassa**\n- **Markets**, such as the **Nouakchott Market**, offering a variety of fresh produce, meat, and spices\n- **Food courts**, offering a range of local and international dishes\n- **Cafes**, serving coffee, tea, and pastries, as well as light meals and snacks\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Nouakchott Market**, a bustling market offering a variety of fresh produce, meat, and spices\n- **Fish market**, a market specializing in fresh fish and seafood\n- **Medina**, a historic neighborhood with narrow streets and traditional restaurants\n- **Desert dinner**, a unique dining experience under the stars in the Sahara Desert\n- **Cooking class**, a hands-on cooking class where you can learn to make traditional Mauritanian dishes",
