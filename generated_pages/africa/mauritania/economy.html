        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Mauritania's economy is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $1,130. The country has a developing economy, with a strong focus on primary industries such as mining and fishing. The economy is also heavily reliant on foreign aid and investment, particularly from countries such as China and the European Union. Despite its natural resources, Mauritania remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a significant portion of its population living below the poverty line.</p>
        <p>Mauritania's economic development has been hindered by a number of factors, including a lack of infrastructure, a small and underdeveloped private sector, and a reliance on a few primary industries. The country has also faced significant challenges related to climate change, including drought and desertification, which have had a major impact on its agricultural sector. However, the government has been working to diversify the economy and attract foreign investment, with a focus on developing its mining and tourism sectors.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Mauritania has made significant progress in terms of economic growth, with GDP growth averaging around 3-4% per year. The country has also made efforts to improve its business environment, including the introduction of new laws and regulations to encourage foreign investment. However, significant challenges remain, including a lack of infrastructure and a highly bureaucratic business environment.</p>

The country is also expected to benefit from significant investment in its infrastructure, including the development of new ports and roads. However, the country will need to be careful to manage its natural resources sustainably, and to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared equitably among the population. With careful planning and management, Mauritania has the potential to achieve significant economic growth and development in the coming years.</p>
