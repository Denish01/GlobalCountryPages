  "content": "The cost of education in Mauritania varies depending on the type of institution and the level of study, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private and international schools can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 4.7%\nLiteracy Rate: 52%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: MRU\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nMauritania's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. The quality of education in public schools is generally lower than in private schools, with limited resources and outdated teaching methods. The language of instruction is Arabic, with French being taught as a secondary language. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are available in the capital city, Nouakchott, and offer a range of curricula, including French, British, and American.\n\nThe education system in Mauritania faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing new curricula. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, with better resources and more qualified teachers, but are generally expensive and out of reach for most Mauritians.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Better resources, more qualified teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $50 (subsidized) | Limited resources, outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,000 | Better resources, more qualified teachers |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Offers French, British, and American curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$300 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs, outdated resources |\n| Private University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | Better resources, more qualified teachers |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$2,500 | $3,000-$4,000 | University of Nouakchott, limited programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability, especially outside Nouakchott |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Popular among students, especially for exam preparation |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | Arabic, French, and English courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic supplies, such as notebooks and pens |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for all students, especially in private schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats are international schools, which offer a range of curricula and better resources.\n- Scholarships are available for students, especially those from low-income families, but are limited and competitive.\n- Online learning options are limited in Mauritania, but some universities offer distance learning programs.\n- Education quality in Mauritania is generally lower than in other countries in the region, due to limited resources and outdated teaching methods.\n- Students who wish to pursue higher education abroad may need to take additional exams, such as the SAT or TOEFL.\n- The government has implemented programs to improve education quality, including teacher training and curriculum development, but more needs to be done to address the challenges facing the education system.",
