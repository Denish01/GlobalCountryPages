[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Mauritania has a limited number of international airports, with the main one being **Nouakchott International Airport** (NKC) in the capital city. This airport receives direct flights from major hubs in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, including Casablanca, Paris, and Dubai. If you're planning to enter Mauritania overland, the main entry points are from Western Sahara, Algeria, Mali, and Senegal, although the border crossings can be challenging and require careful planning.

Travelers can also enter Mauritania by sea, with the port city of **Nouadhibou** being a major entry point for cargo and passenger ships. However, this option is not commonly used by tourists and is mostly reserved for commercial activities. It's essential to research the current entry requirements and regulations before planning your trip to Mauritania, as they can change frequently.
