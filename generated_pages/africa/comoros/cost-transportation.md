[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Comoros, an archipelago off the coast of East Africa, has a limited but developing transportation network. The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and minibuses, which are commonly used by locals and visitors alike. The quality of public transit is relatively basic, with most buses and minibuses being privately owned and operated. Most people get around using these shared transportation services, which are affordable and widely available. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system can make it challenging for tourists to navigate the islands, especially outside of the capital city Moroni.

The roads in Comoros are generally in poor condition, which can make traveling by car or bus a bumpy and time-consuming experience. Despite these challenges, the scenic beauty of the islands and the friendly locals make traveling in Comoros a unique and rewarding experience. With some planning and flexibility, visitors can easily get around the islands and enjoy all that Comoros has to offer.
