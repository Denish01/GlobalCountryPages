The average internet speed is around 5 Mbps, which can be slow for heavy users, but sufficient for basic browsing and communication. However, there is a significant urban-rural divide, with cities like Moroni having better connectivity than rural areas, where internet access can be scarce and unreliable. The reliability of the internet connection also varies, with frequent outages and disruptions, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Comorian government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber-optic cables and mobile network upgrades. This has led to an increase in internet penetration, with more people having access to mobile networks and WiFi, especially in urban areas. However, the cost of internet access can be prohibitively expensive for many Comorians, making it a luxury that only a few can afford.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Comoros, tourists and residents can visit one of the main carriers' stores, such as Huri, Telco, or Comores Telecom, and provide a valid passport and proof of address. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, and it usually comes with a pre-loaded amount of credit that can be used for calls, texts, and data. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as they offer better coverage and quality of service. Data plans are available, with prices varying depending on the carrier and the amount of data included.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Huri | Huri Tourist | 1 GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Telco | Telco Visitor | 2 GB | 15 | Valid for 14 days |\n| Comores Telecom | Comores Telecom Tourist | 3 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Djeba | Djeba Tourist | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 7 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many hotels offering free WiFi to their guests, although the speed can be slow.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not well-established in Comoros, with few cafes offering WiFi, and the speed can be slow.\n- Coworking spaces are scarce, but some are available in Moroni, offering reliable WiFi and a productive environment.\n- Public WiFi is limited, with few hotspots available in public areas, such as airports and government buildings.\n- Some restaurants and bars may offer WiFi, but it is not always reliable or fast.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Moroni Coworking and Comoros Coworking offer reliable WiFi and a productive environment.\n- Cafe chains like Cafe de la Paix and Cafe du Port offer decent WiFi, although the speed can be slow.\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and satellite internet are available, although they can be expensive.\n- VPNs are recommended to ensure secure and private internet access, especially when using public WiFi.\n- Remote workers may need to consider alternative accommodation options, such as apartments or houses, that offer reliable WiFi and a quiet environment.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major issue in Comoros, but some websites may be blocked due to government restrictions.\n- **VPNs** are recommended to ensure secure and private internet access, especially when using public WiFi.\n- Roaming alternatives like eSIMs and portable WiFi hotspots are available, although they can be expensive.\n- Internet outages and disruptions can occur frequently, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.\n- **eSIMs** are a convenient option for tourists, as they do not require a physical SIM card and can be easily purchased online.\n- Public WiFi should be used with caution, as it can be vulnerable to hacking and cyber attacks.",
