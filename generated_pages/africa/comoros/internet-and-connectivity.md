[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Comoros is still in the development stage, with the majority of the population relying on mobile networks for access. The average internet speed is around 5 Mbps, which can be slow for heavy users, but sufficient for basic browsing and communication. However, there is a significant urban-rural divide, with cities like Moroni having better connectivity than rural areas, where internet access can be scarce and unreliable. The reliability of the internet connection also varies, with frequent outages and disruptions, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.

Despite these challenges, the Comorian government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber-optic cables and mobile network upgrades. This has led to an increase in internet penetration, with more people having access to mobile networks and WiFi, especially in urban areas. However, the cost of internet access can be prohibitively expensive for many Comorians, making it a luxury that only a few can afford.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Comoros, tourists and residents can visit one of the main carriers' stores, such as Huri, Telco, or Comores Telecom, and provide a valid passport and proof of address.

It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as they offer better coverage and quality of service. Data plans are available, with prices varying depending on the carrier and the amount of data included.
