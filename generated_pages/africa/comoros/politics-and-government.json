The president is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, while the prime minister is appointed by the president. The Assembly of the Union, the unicameral legislature, is composed of 33 members elected by popular vote for five-year terms. The system of government is characterized by a separation of powers, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **separation of powers** is designed to prevent any one branch of government from dominating the others, and to ensure that power is distributed evenly.\n\nThe Comorian government has a federal structure, with three main islands ( Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moheli) having a degree of autonomy. The federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and economic policy, while the island governments have responsibility for matters such as education, health, and infrastructure. This **federal system** allows for a degree of decentralization and regional autonomy, while also maintaining a strong central government.\n\nThe Comorian legal system is based on a mix of French civil law, Islamic law, and customary law. The **legal system** is designed to reflect the country's cultural and historical heritage, and to provide a framework for the resolution of disputes and the administration of justice.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Azali Assoumani | Head of State |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Mohamed Ousseini | Head of Government |\n| Legislative | Assembly of the Union | Speaker of the Assembly | Lawmaking |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Judicial Review |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Union for the Development of the Comoros | Center-right | President Azali Assoumani | 20 | Dominant party |\n| Democratic Rally of the Comoros | Center-left | Former President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi | 6 | Main opposition party |\n| Comorian Union for Progress | Center | Ibrahim Mlad | 3 | Minor party |\n| National Front for Justice | Right-wing | Ahmed Faiz | 2 | Minor party |\n| Rally for a Democratic Comoros | Center-left | Former Prime Minister Ikililou Dhoinine | 2 | Minor party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Comoros is based on a mix of direct and indirect elections, with the president and members of the Assembly of the Union elected by popular vote.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent presidential election taking place in 2019.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled to take place in 2024.\n- Voter participation in Comorian elections is generally high, with turnout rates often exceeding 50%.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Comoros is characterized by a degree of instability, with the country having experienced several coups and changes of government in recent years.\n- Key issues facing the government include poverty, corruption, and regional disparities in economic development.\n- The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global commodity prices and climate-related disasters.\n- Comoros has a low ranking in the Global Peace Index, reflecting the country's history of conflict and instability.\n- The country also has a low ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index, reflecting the prevalence of corruption and lack of transparency in government.\n- Freedom of speech and assembly are generally respected in Comoros, but there are limits on these freedoms, particularly in times of political unrest.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Comoros is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the Arab League.\n- The country has diplomatic relations with several countries, including France, the United States, and China.\n- Comoros has a strategic location in the Indian Ocean, and has sought to develop its relationships with countries in the region, including India and Japan.\n- The country has also sought to strengthen its economic ties with other countries, particularly in the areas of trade and investment.\n- Comoros has a neutral stance on most international issues, but has been supportive of African and Arab causes, particularly in the areas of development and human rights.",
