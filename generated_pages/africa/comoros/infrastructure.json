  "content": "The infrastructure in Comoros is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, with limited access to electricity, water, and sanitation, as well as a poor road network and limited transportation options. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 64% of population\nInternet Penetration: 8%\nRoad Network: 880 km, poor quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nComoros, an archipelago of four islands off the coast of East Africa, faces significant infrastructure challenges that hinder its economic development and affect the daily lives of its citizens. The country's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with a focus on basic services such as electricity, water, and transportation. Recent investments have been made to improve the road network and expand access to electricity, but much work remains to be done to address the urban-rural gap and provide reliable services to all citizens. The government has also launched initiatives to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, but progress has been slow due to funding constraints and bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nThe infrastructure gap between urban and rural areas is significant, with cities like Moroni and Mutsamudu having better access to basic services than rural areas. In rural areas, many communities lack access to electricity, clean water, and sanitation facilities, making them vulnerable to water-borne diseases and other health risks. The government has recognized the need to address this gap and has launched programs to expand access to basic services in rural areas, but progress has been slow due to funding constraints and logistical challenges.\n\nDespite these challenges, Comoros has made significant progress in recent years in improving its infrastructure, particularly in the areas of electricity and transportation. The government has invested in upgrading the road network, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones. Additionally, the country has seen an increase in private sector investment in the energy sector, with new power plants and renewable energy projects coming online.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 880 km | Poor | Many roads are unpaved and prone to flooding during the rainy season |\n| Railways | 0 km | N/A | Comoros has no railway network |\n| Airports | 4 international, 0 domestic | Good | The main airport, Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport, is located in Moroni |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | The ports of Moroni and Mutsamudu are the main entry points for goods and cargo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Comoros relies heavily on **fossil fuels** for power generation, with diesel-powered plants accounting for the majority of electricity production.\n- The country has made significant progress in recent years in increasing access to electricity, with the percentage of the population with access to electricity rising from 45% in 2010 to 64% in 2020.\n- However, the electricity supply is still **unreliable**, with frequent power outages and voltage fluctuations.\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote the use of **renewable energy**, including solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and improve energy security.\n- Comoros has also received funding from international organizations to upgrade its power grid and improve the efficiency of its energy sector.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **clean water** is a significant challenge in Comoros, particularly in rural areas where many communities lack access to piped water.\n- The country has made progress in recent years in improving access to sanitation facilities, with the percentage of the population with access to improved sanitation facilities rising from 20% in 2010 to 35% in 2020.\n- However, **water-borne diseases** remain a significant health risk, particularly in rural areas where sanitation facilities are limited.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve access to clean water and sanitation facilities, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sanitation facilities.\n- Comoros has also received funding from international organizations to support the development of its water and sanitation sector, including the provision of technical assistance and capacity-building programs.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile phone coverage** is widespread in Comoros, with all major operators offering coverage in urban and rural areas.\n- However, **internet penetration** is still relatively low, with only 8% of the population having access to the internet.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve access to telecommunications services, including the expansion of mobile phone coverage and the introduction of new internet services.\n- Comoros has also received funding from international organizations to support the development of its telecommunications sector, including the provision of technical assistance and capacity-building programs.\n- The country has also seen an increase in the use of **mobile money** services, which have improved access to financial services for many citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major **road upgrade project** to improve the condition of the country's road network, with funding from international organizations.\n- Comoros has also received funding to support the development of its **energy sector**, including the construction of new power plants and the upgrade of the power grid.\n- The country has also launched initiatives to improve access to **clean water** and **sanitation facilities**, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sanitation facilities.\n- The government has also received funding to support the development of its **telecommunications sector**, including the expansion of mobile phone coverage and the introduction of new internet services.\n- Comoros has also launched a major **port development project** to improve the efficiency and capacity of its ports, with funding from international organizations.",
