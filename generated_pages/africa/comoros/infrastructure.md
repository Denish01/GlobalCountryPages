[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Comoros, an archipelago of four islands off the coast of East Africa, faces significant infrastructure challenges that hinder its economic development and affect the daily lives of its citizens. The country's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with a focus on basic services such as electricity, water, and transportation. Recent investments have been made to improve the road network and expand access to electricity, but much work remains to be done to address the urban-rural gap and provide reliable services to all citizens. The government has also launched initiatives to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, but progress has been slow due to funding constraints and bureaucratic hurdles.

The infrastructure gap between urban and rural areas is significant, with cities like Moroni and Mutsamudu having better access to basic services than rural areas. In rural areas, many communities lack access to electricity, clean water, and sanitation facilities, making them vulnerable to water-borne diseases and other health risks. The government has recognized the need to address this gap and has launched programs to expand access to basic services in rural areas, but progress has been slow due to funding constraints and logistical challenges.

Despite these challenges, Comoros has made significant progress in recent years in improving its infrastructure, particularly in the areas of electricity and transportation. The government has invested in upgrading the road network, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones. Additionally, the country has seen an increase in private sector investment in the energy sector, with new power plants and renewable energy projects coming online.
