  "content": "Healthcare in Comoros is a mixed system with both public and private providers, offering a range of services, although the quality of care and access to facilities can vary significantly between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 15\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Comoros is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which provides public healthcare services through a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, limited resources, and inadequate infrastructure. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality services, but are largely unaffordable for the majority of the population. Urban areas, such as the capital Moroni, tend to have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often rely on traditional medicine and limited public health services.\n\nThe quality of care in Comoros is a significant concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies. Additionally, the country faces a shortage of specialized medical professionals, making it difficult for patients to access specialized care. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities.\n\nComoros also faces significant health challenges, including a high prevalence of infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. The country's healthcare system is also heavily reliant on foreign aid and support from international organizations, which can be unpredictable and subject to change.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| El-Maarouf Hospital | Moroni | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| CNAM (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie) | Moroni | Public | General medicine, pediatrics, cardiology | Limited |\n| Centre Hospitalier de Mitsamiouli | Mitsamiouli | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Clinique du Nord | Moutsamoudou | Private | General medicine, surgery, dentistry | Moderate |\n| Polyclinique de Moroni | Moroni | Private | General medicine, cardiology, ophthalmology | Moderate |\n| Hôpital de Fomboni | Fomboni | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it provides access to higher-quality private healthcare services.\n- Local insurance options are available, but may not provide comprehensive coverage.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** plans are available from international insurance providers, offering coverage for medical evacuation, hospitalization, and other medical expenses.\n- The cost of health insurance in Comoros can vary significantly, depending on the provider, level of coverage, and individual circumstances.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors, as it provides coverage for unexpected medical expenses and emergencies.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are available at pharmacies and some hospitals, but the selection can be limited, especially in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, but may not always be up-to-date or authentic.\n- **Costs** can vary significantly, depending on the medication and provider.\n- **Traditional medicine** is also widely used in Comoros, but its efficacy and safety can vary.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for travelers arriving from or passing through countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission.\n- **Hepatitis A and B vaccinations** are recommended for all travelers.\n- **Malaria prophylaxis** is recommended, especially for travelers to rural areas.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water or eating undercooked food.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating high-risk foods, such as undercooked meat or raw vegetables.\n- **Insect-borne diseases**, such as dengue fever and chikungunya, are present in Comoros, and travelers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Comoros, due to the limited availability of high-quality healthcare services.\n- However, some private clinics and hospitals may offer specialized services, such as dental care or cosmetic surgery.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for some medical procedures, but this is not always the case.\n- **Accreditation** is not always available, and travelers should research the credentials and reputation of any medical facility before seeking treatment.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, travelers should call the emergency number (15) or seek assistance from a local hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance services** are limited, and travelers may need to rely on private transportation or taxis.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may not always have the necessary equipment or staff to provide adequate care.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, and travelers should ensure they have the necessary documentation and contact information for their insurance provider.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in serious cases, and travelers should research the availability and cost of evacuation services before traveling to Comoros.",
