[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Comorian political system is based on the principles of democracy, with the president serving as head of state and the prime minister as head of government. The president is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, while the prime minister is appointed by the president. The Assembly of the Union, the unicameral legislature, is composed of 33 members elected by popular vote for five-year terms. The system of government is characterized by a separation of powers, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **separation of powers** is designed to prevent any one branch of government from dominating the others, and to ensure that power is distributed evenly.

The Comorian government has a federal structure, with three main islands ( Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moheli) having a degree of autonomy. The federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and economic policy, while the island governments have responsibility for matters such as education, health, and infrastructure. This **federal system** allows for a degree of decentralization and regional autonomy, while also maintaining a strong central government.

The Comorian legal system is based on a mix of French civil law, Islamic law, and customary law. The **legal system** is designed to reflect the country's cultural and historical heritage, and to provide a framework for the resolution of disputes and the administration of justice.
