[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Comoros is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which provides public healthcare services through a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, limited resources, and inadequate infrastructure. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality services, but are largely unaffordable for the majority of the population. Urban areas, such as the capital Moroni, tend to have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often rely on traditional medicine and limited public health services.

The quality of care in Comoros is a significant concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies. Additionally, the country faces a shortage of specialized medical professionals, making it difficult for patients to access specialized care. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities.

Comoros also faces significant health challenges, including a high prevalence of infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. The country's healthcare system is also heavily reliant on foreign aid and support from international organizations, which can be unpredictable and subject to change.
