        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The Comoros, an archipelago located in the Indian Ocean, has a rich and complex history dating back to the 8th century. The islands were initially inhabited by <strong>Bantu</strong> peoples from the African mainland, followed by <strong>Arabic</strong> and <strong>Persian</strong> settlers who introduced <strong>Islam</strong> to the region. In the 16th century, the Comoros became a major hub for trade and commerce, with the islands serving as a key stopover for merchants traveling between Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.</p>
        <p>The Comoros was colonized by <strong>France</strong> in the 19th century, with the islands becoming a French protectorate in 1886. The French established a colonial administration, introduced <strong>French</strong> as the official language, and promoted the development of the islands' economy. The Comoros gained independence from France on July 6, 1975, with <strong>Ahmed Abdallah</strong> becoming the country's first president. Since then, the Comoros has experienced a series of coups and power struggles, with the current government seeking to promote stability and economic development.</p>
        <p>The Comoros is a <strong>sovereign</strong> nation, with a <strong>presidential system</strong> of government. The country is a member of the <strong>African Union</strong>, the <strong>Arab League</strong>, and the <strong>United Nations</strong>, and has diplomatic relations with countries around the world.
