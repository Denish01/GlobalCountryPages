[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Comoros has a **mixed healthcare system**, which means that both public and private healthcare services are available. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and equipment, while private healthcare services are often more modern and well-equipped, but also more expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it may choose to use private healthcare services.

The healthcare system in Comoros is not universal, and many people rely on **out-of-pocket payments** to access healthcare services. This can be a significant burden for many individuals and families, particularly those living in rural areas where healthcare services may be limited. Insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners who may not be familiar with the local healthcare system. There are several insurance options available, including local and international plans, which can help to cover the cost of healthcare services.
