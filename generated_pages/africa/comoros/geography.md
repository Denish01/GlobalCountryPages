[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Comoros is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa. It is situated between the northern tip of Madagascar and the coast of Mozambique, with the Mozambique Channel to the west and the Indian Ocean to the east. The country is an archipelago, comprising four main islands: Grande Comore, Anjouan, Moheli, and Mayotte. However, Mayotte is currently an overseas department of France and is not part of the Union of the Comoros.

The Comoros islands are strategically positioned at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel, which separates the island of Madagascar from the African mainland. The country's unique location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The islands are also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, with many species found nowhere else in the world. The surrounding waters are home to an incredible array of marine life, including coral reefs, dolphins, and whales.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The Comoros islands are volcanic in origin, with rugged terrain and dramatic landscapes. The highest point, Mount Karthala, is an active volcano that dominates the island of Grande Comore. The volcano is over 2,300 meters tall and is considered one of the most active volcanoes in the world. The islands are also home to numerous smaller volcanic peaks, as well as scenic valleys and coastal plains. The terrain is generally mountainous, with steep slopes and deep valleys carved out by rivers and streams.

The islands are covered in lush tropical forests, with a wide range of plant species, including coconut palms, mangroves, and fruit trees. The forests are home to a variety of wildlife, including lemurs, birds, and reptiles. The coastal areas are characterized by beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and rocky shores. The islands are also home to several scenic lakes and waterfalls, including the stunning Lac Salé on the island of Grande Comore.

The unique geography of the Comoros islands has created a diverse range of ecosystems, from the coral reefs and marine life of the coastal areas to the lush forests and volcanic peaks of the interior. The islands are also home to several important wetlands, including the Mitsamiouli-Mwali marine and coastal ecosystem, which is a vital breeding ground for sea turtles and other marine species.
