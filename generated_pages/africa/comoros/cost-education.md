[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Comoros is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest provider of education. Public education is generally of lower quality compared to private education, with limited resources and infrastructure. The language of instruction in public schools is Comorian, Arabic, and French, while private schools may use French or English as the primary language of instruction. Compulsory education in Comoros lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are available in the capital city of Moroni, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the French baccalaureate.

The quality of education in Comoros is a concern, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, with better infrastructure and more qualified teachers. However, private education is not accessible to all, as it is expensive and often reserved for the wealthy. International schools in Comoros offer a high-quality education, but are also expensive and mainly cater to the expatriate community.
