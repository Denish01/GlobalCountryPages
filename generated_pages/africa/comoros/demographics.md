[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Comoros is relatively small, with a total of approximately 919,901 people, according to the latest estimates. The country has experienced a moderate population growth rate of 1.8% per annum, driven by a relatively high total fertility rate of 4.3 children per woman. The population is predominantly young, with a median age of 20.4 years, and is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slowing rate, due to declining fertility rates and increasing urbanization. Comoros has a relatively low level of urbanization, with only 28% of the population residing in urban areas, although this is expected to increase as the economy develops and more people move to cities in search of employment opportunities.

Comoros has a long history of migration, with many citizens traveling to other countries in search of work or education. The country has a significant diaspora community, particularly in France, where many Comorians have settled. However, the country also faces challenges related to migration, including brain drain and the loss of skilled workers to other countries. Despite these challenges, Comoros has made significant progress in recent years in terms of economic development and poverty reduction, and the government is working to create more job opportunities and improve living standards for its citizens.

The population of Comoros is also characterized by a high level of population density, with an average of 495 people per square kilometer. This has put pressure on the country's natural resources, including land, water, and energy, and has contributed to environmental degradation and poverty in some areas. However, the government is working to address these challenges through sustainable development initiatives and investments in infrastructure and social services.
