Comoros, with a smaller population and economy, tends to have lower prices for goods and services compared to Madagascar. The economic context of Comoros is largely driven by agriculture, fishing, and tourism, which contributes to its relatively low cost of living.

However, it's worth noting that Comoros has a more limited range of goods and services available, particularly in terms of luxury items and high-end amenities.
