  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Comoros can vary, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $100 to $200, while internet plans with 60 Mbps speed can cost around $30 to $50 per month.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($150 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($40 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.20 per kWh)\nCurrency: KMF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Comoros is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The costs of utilities can fluctuate due to the country's reliance on imported fuel and the impact of inflation, which was 5.0% in 2024. The Comorian government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the quality of services can vary depending on the location. In general, utility costs in Comoros are relatively high compared to other African countries, but they can be managed with careful planning and budgeting.\n\nThe seasonal variation in utility costs is also a factor to consider in Comoros. During the dry season, which runs from May to October, water shortages can occur, leading to increased costs for water tankers and other alternative sources of water. In contrast, the rainy season, which runs from November to April, can lead to flooding and power outages, resulting in increased costs for repairs and maintenance. Understanding these seasonal variations can help individuals and businesses plan their utility budgets more effectively.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane or butane) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$160** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Comores Telecom, Telma |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 60 Mbps | Comores Telecom, Telma |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Comores Telecom, Telma |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | Comores Telecom, Telma |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Comores Telecom, Telma |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | (available in Comoros) |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | (available in Comoros) |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Comores TV) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Comoros, it is recommended to contact the utility providers (e.g. Comores Telecom, Telma) directly and provide the necessary documents, such as a passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available in Comoros, which can help individuals and businesses manage their electricity costs more effectively.\n- The best internet providers in Comoros are Comores Telecom and Telma, which offer a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use water wisely.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with utility providers to get the best rates and plans, especially for long-term contracts or bulk purchases.",
