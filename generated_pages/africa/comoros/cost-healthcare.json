The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and equipment, while private healthcare services are often more modern and well-equipped, but also more expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it may choose to use private healthcare services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Comoros is not universal, and many people rely on **out-of-pocket payments** to access healthcare services. This can be a significant burden for many individuals and families, particularly those living in rural areas where healthcare services may be limited. Insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners who may not be familiar with the local healthcare system. There are several insurance options available, including local and international plans, which can help to cover the cost of healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Prices vary by location and dentist |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Prices vary by location and optometrist |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by laboratory and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Prices vary by type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Covers medical services worldwide, including evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in Comoros, but may be more expensive than in other countries.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also widely available, but may be limited in terms of selection and quality.\n- The cost of **common medications**, such as antibiotics and painkillers, can range from $5-$20 per prescription.\n- **Pharmacies** are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Prescription rules** vary by medication and pharmacy, but generally require a doctor's prescription.\n- **Medication prices** can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek help quickly and efficiently. The **emergency number** in Comoros is 15, and ambulances are available in major cities. However, emergency services may be limited in rural areas, and it may be necessary to seek help from a private clinic or hospital. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek help from a private hospital or clinic, as they are often better equipped to handle emergency situations and may have staff who speak English or other foreign languages.\n\nFor emergency care, it is recommended to visit one of the major hospitals in Moroni, such as the **CNAM** (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie) hospital or the **El-Maarouf** hospital. These hospitals have better equipment and more experienced staff, and may be able to provide more comprehensive care in emergency situations. Additionally, it is essential to have **health insurance** that covers emergency medical evacuations, as medical facilities in Comoros may not be equipped to handle all types of medical emergencies.",
