Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month security deposit required. Tenant rights are generally protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract to avoid disputes. Compared to regional neighbors like Madagascar and Mozambique, Comoros's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and locals alike. However, the quality of housing can vary significantly, with many older buildings in need of renovation.\n\nThe housing market in Comoros is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with an inflation rate of 5.0% in 2024, which can impact the cost of living and housing prices. Additionally, the government's education spend of 2.3% of GDP in 2023 may have a positive effect on the overall quality of life, but it may not directly impact housing prices. The out-of-pocket health spend of 56.6% in 2023 may also be a consideration for those looking to rent or buy property in Comoros, as healthcare costs can be a significant expense.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$250 | $100-$200 | Basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$350 | $150-$300 | Furnished, with kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $250-$450 | Spacious, with living room and kitchen |\n| 3 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $350-$600 | Luxury, with modern amenities and parking |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,000-$2,000 | Prime locations, modern apartments |\n| Suburbs | $500-$1,500 | Residential areas, older houses |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | Traditional houses, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Moroni City Center**: $200-$500 USD per month, modern apartments with amenities like restaurants and shops\n- **Itsandra**: $150-$300 USD per month, residential area with a mix of old and new houses\n- **Fumbuni**: $100-$250 USD per month, coastal area with traditional houses and a relaxed atmosphere\n- **Mitsamiouli**: $200-$400 USD per month, beach town with a growing expat community\n- **Hahaya**: $150-$300 USD per month, suburban area with a mix of apartments and houses\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Comoros [/SECTION]\n- Research local real estate agents and property owners to find available rentals\n- Inspect the property thoroughly before signing a lease to avoid disputes\n- Negotiate the rent and deposit with the landlord, as prices can be flexible\n- Be aware of scams, such as fake property listings or agents demanding upfront fees\n- Utilities like electricity and water are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, so clarify with the landlord before signing a lease",
