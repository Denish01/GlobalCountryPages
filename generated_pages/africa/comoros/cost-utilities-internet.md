[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Comoros is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The costs of utilities can fluctuate due to the country's reliance on imported fuel and the impact of inflation, which was 5.0% in 2024. The Comorian government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the quality of services can vary depending on the location. In general, utility costs in Comoros are relatively high compared to other African countries, but they can be managed with careful planning and budgeting.

The seasonal variation in utility costs is also a factor to consider in Comoros. During the dry season, which runs from May to October, water shortages can occur, leading to increased costs for water tankers and other alternative sources of water. In contrast, the rainy season, which runs from November to April, can lead to flooding and power outages, resulting in increased costs for repairs and maintenance. Understanding these seasonal variations can help individuals and businesses plan their utility budgets more effectively.
