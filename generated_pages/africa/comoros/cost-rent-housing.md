[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Comoros is relatively small, with a limited supply of modern apartments and houses, particularly in the city center. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month security deposit required. Tenant rights are generally protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract to avoid disputes. Compared to regional neighbors like Madagascar and Mozambique, Comoros's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and locals alike. However, the quality of housing can vary significantly, with many older buildings in need of renovation.

The housing market in Comoros is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with an inflation rate of 5.0% in 2024, which can impact the cost of living and housing prices. Additionally, the government's education spend of 2.3% of GDP in 2023 may have a positive effect on the overall quality of life, but it may not directly impact housing prices. The out-of-pocket health spend of 56.6% in 2023 may also be a consideration for those looking to rent or buy property in Comoros, as healthcare costs can be a significant expense.
