The country's food prices are generally higher than the regional average due to its island location and limited agricultural production. The inflation rate of 5.0% in 2024 has also contributed to the increase in food prices. However, the cost of food in Comoros can be managed by opting for local cuisine and ingredients, which are often cheaper than imported goods. Eating out is not a common practice in Comoros, and most people prefer to cook at home using fresh ingredients from the local markets.\n\nThe food prices in Comoros are driven by various factors, including the cost of transportation, import duties, and the country's limited agricultural production. The country relies heavily on imports to meet its food needs, which can drive up prices. However, the government has implemented initiatives to promote local agriculture and reduce dependence on imports. The eating-out culture in Comoros is not well-developed, and most restaurants cater to tourists and expatriates. As a result, the prices of meals at mid-range and fine dining restaurants can be relatively high. On the other hand, street food and local eateries offer affordable options for those who want to try traditional Comorian cuisine.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 750 KMF | Imported from South Africa |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 600 KMF | Local production |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 1000 KMF | Local production |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 500 KMF | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $4.00 | 2000 KMF | Local production |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 3000 KMF | Imported from South Africa |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 1500 KMF | Imported from France |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 750 KMF | Local production |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 500 KMF | Local production |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 400 KMF | Local production |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00 | 2500 KMF | Local production |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 500 KMF | Local production |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | Traditional dishes like **skoudehkaris** and **langouste** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | One person, local cuisine |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$40 | 3 courses, international cuisine |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | Upscale, international cuisine |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | **Comoros beer** |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | European beers |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | Coffee shops |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | Local and international brands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Comoros can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices that are often 20-30% higher than those at local markets. However, supermarkets offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and often have better quality control. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and local products at lower prices. It is recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while opting for supermarkets for packaged goods and imported products.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets is due to various factors, including the cost of transportation, storage, and marketing. Supermarkets have higher operational costs, which are reflected in the prices of their products. Local markets, on the other hand, are often informal and have lower operational costs, which enables them to offer lower prices. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and visitors can often negotiate prices by 10-20%. It is recommended to learn some basic Comorian phrases, such as **\"nzuri\"** (hello) and **\"beha\"** (goodbye), to engage with local vendors and get better prices.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Comoros is to opt for street food and local eateries, which offer traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- Local staples like **rice**, **beans**, and **vegetables** are good value and can be bought at local markets.\n- Fresh seafood is abundant in Comoros and can be bought at local markets or from fishermen.\n- Avoid buying imported products, such as **apples** and **beef**, which can be expensive.\n- Try local fruits, such as **mangos** and **papayas**, which are abundant and cheap.\n- Learn to cook local dishes, such as **skoudehkaris** and **langouste**, to save money and experience the local culture.",
