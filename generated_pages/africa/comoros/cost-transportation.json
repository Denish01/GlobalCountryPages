The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and minibuses, which are commonly used by locals and visitors alike. The quality of public transit is relatively basic, with most buses and minibuses being privately owned and operated. Most people get around using these shared transportation services, which are affordable and widely available. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system can make it challenging for tourists to navigate the islands, especially outside of the capital city Moroni.\n\nThe roads in Comoros are generally in poor condition, which can make traveling by car or bus a bumpy and time-consuming experience. Despite these challenges, the scenic beauty of the islands and the friendly locals make traveling in Comoros a unique and rewarding experience. With some planning and flexibility, visitors can easily get around the islands and enjoy all that Comoros has to offer.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $10 | Limited coverage, mostly in Moroni |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | Routes connect major towns and villages |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Not always available |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Moroni city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited schedules and routes |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Between major islands, limited schedules |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using shared taxis or minibuses, which are affordable and widely available.\n- Be prepared to negotiate taxi fares, as meters are not always used.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or services, especially when traveling at night.\n- Consider renting a car for flexibility and convenience, but be aware of the poor road conditions.\n- Download maps or transportation apps to help navigate the islands, as internet connectivity can be limited.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.",
