Public education is generally of lower quality compared to private education, with limited resources and infrastructure. The language of instruction in public schools is Comorian, Arabic, and French, while private schools may use French or English as the primary language of instruction. Compulsory education in Comoros lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are available in the capital city of Moroni, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the French baccalaureate.\n\nThe quality of education in Comoros is a concern, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, with better infrastructure and more qualified teachers. However, private education is not accessible to all, as it is expensive and often reserved for the wealthy. International schools in Comoros offer a high-quality education, but are also expensive and mainly cater to the expatriate community.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and infrastructure |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Range of quality and curricula |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and infrastructure |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,000 | Range of quality and curricula |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | IB, French, and other curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$300 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs and resources |\n| Private University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Range of programs and quality |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | University of Comoros, limited programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Range of subjects and quality |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | French, Arabic, and Comorian |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic supplies, e.g., notebooks, pens |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Required for public and private schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Comoros are international schools, offering a range of curricula and high-quality education.\n- Scholarships are limited in Comoros, but some organizations offer scholarships to students pursuing higher education.\n- Online learning options are limited in Comoros, but some universities offer online courses and programs.\n- The education quality in Comoros is lower compared to other countries in the region, due to limited resources and infrastructure.\n- **French** and **Arabic** are the most widely spoken languages in Comoros, and proficiency in these languages can be beneficial for students.\n- The **University of Comoros** is the top-ranked university in the country, offering a range of programs, including medicine, law, and engineering.",
