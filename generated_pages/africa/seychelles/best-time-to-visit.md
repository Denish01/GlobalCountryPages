[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Seychelles: April, May, September, October, and November. Peak season: December to March and June to August. Budget season: April to May and September to November. Avoid: January and February due to the northwest monsoon, which brings heavy rainfall and strong winds. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Seychelles has a tropical climate with two distinct seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from April to May and September to November, is characterized by calm and pleasant weather, with average temperatures ranging from 75°F to 88°F (24°C to 31°C). This is the best time to visit Seychelles, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and hiking. The wet season, which runs from December to March and June to August, is marked by heavy rainfall and strong winds, making it less ideal for water activities.

The climate in Seychelles is also influenced by its location near the equator, which means that the temperature remains relatively constant throughout the year. However, the **humidity** levels can be high, especially during the wet season. The **trade winds** also play a significant role in shaping the climate, with the northwest monsoon bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds during the wet season.

The seasons in Seychelles can significantly affect travel plans, as some activities and attractions may be closed or restricted during the wet season. For example, some **islands** may be inaccessible due to rough seas, and some **hiking trails** may be closed due to heavy rainfall. However, the wet season can also be a good time to visit Seychelles if you're looking for **lower prices** and fewer crowds.
