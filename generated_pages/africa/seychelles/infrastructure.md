[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Seychelles has a relatively high level of infrastructure development compared to other African countries, with a strong focus on supporting its tourism industry. Recent investments have been made in upgrading the country's roads, ports, and energy systems, with a particular emphasis on increasing the use of renewable energy sources. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to certain basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water.

The government of Seychelles has been actively working to address these disparities, with a range of initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure and services in rural areas. This includes investments in new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities, as well as programs to improve access to clean water and sanitation. Despite these efforts, however, challenges remain, and the country's infrastructure is still vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events.

Overall, Seychelles' infrastructure is well-suited to supporting the country's tourism industry, with a range of high-quality amenities and services available in urban areas. However, further investment is needed to address the needs of rural communities and to ensure that the country's infrastructure is resilient and sustainable in the face of future challenges.
