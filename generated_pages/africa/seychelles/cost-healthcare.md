[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Seychelles is a mixed system, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, and is usually free or low-cost for locals. However, foreigners may be required to pay for services, and the quality of care can vary depending on the facility and location. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, tend to offer higher-quality care and more modern equipment, but at a significantly higher cost. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.

The healthcare system in Seychelles is generally well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the islands. However, there can be a shortage of specialized medical care and equipment, particularly on the outer islands. In such cases, patients may need to be transferred to the main island of Mahé for further treatment. It is essential for visitors and expats to research their options and choose a reputable healthcare provider, and to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 151, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic. Ambulance services are available, but may be limited on the outer islands. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally the private hospitals on the main island of Mahé, such as the Seychelles Hospital or the North Island Hospital. These hospitals offer more comprehensive services and better-equipped facilities, but may be more expensive than public hospitals. It is crucial to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency, including having a list of emergency contact numbers and knowing the location of the nearest hospital or clinic.

The quality of emergency care in Seychelles can vary depending on the facility and location. However, the public healthcare system has made significant improvements in recent years, and emergency services are generally well-organized. It is still recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency medical evacuation, as in some cases, patients may need to be transferred to a hospital in a nearby country for further treatment. Visitors and expats should research their options and choose a reputable healthcare provider, and have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency.
