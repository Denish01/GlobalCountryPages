[SECTION] How Seychelles Is Divided [/SECTION]
Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands, with a total land area of approximately 455 square kilometers. The country is divided into 26 districts, each with its own unique character and charm. The districts are further grouped into three main regions: the Inner Islands, the Outer Islands, and the distant islands of Bird Island and Denis Island. The Inner Islands are the most populous and economically developed, with the capital city of Victoria located on the island of Mahé.

The administrative structure of Seychelles is designed to promote local governance and community development. Each district has its own district administration, which is responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure maintenance. The districts are also represented in the national assembly, which is the country's legislative body. This system of governance allows for a high degree of autonomy and flexibility, enabling the districts to respond to local needs and priorities.
