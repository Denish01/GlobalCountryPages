[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Seychelles, an archipelago of 115 islands, has a relatively well-developed transportation system, considering its size and population. The main modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and rental cars, with most people relying on buses and taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is generally good, with buses covering most areas of the main islands, including Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue. However, the frequency and coverage of buses can vary depending on the time of day and the island.

The lack of a comprehensive rail network and the limited availability of ride-hailing services outside of the capital, Victoria, can make it challenging to get around without a car. Nevertheless, the scenic beauty of the islands and the relatively short distances between destinations make walking and cycling attractive options for shorter journeys. Additionally, many hotels and resorts offer shuttle services to and from the airport, making it easier for tourists to get around without having to worry about transportation.
