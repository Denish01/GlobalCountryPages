[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Seychelles is relatively small and competitive, with a high demand for apartments and houses, particularly in the city center of Victoria. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to carefully review the lease agreement before signing. Compared to regional neighbors like Madagascar and Mauritius, Seychelles has a more expensive housing market, driven by its limited land area and high demand for tourism-related accommodations. The country's strong economy and high standard of living also contribute to the relatively high cost of housing.

The housing market in Seychelles is influenced by the tourism industry, with many apartments and houses being rented out to visitors and expatriates. This has driven up prices, particularly in the city center and popular tourist areas. However, for those who are willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available. The government has also implemented measures to control rents and protect tenants, but the market remains competitive, and renters need to be prepared to act quickly to secure a suitable property.
