[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Seychelles is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being generally considered to be of high quality. The language of instruction is predominantly **Seychellois Creole**, with **English** and **French** also being widely used. Compulsory education in Seychelles lasts for 12 years, from the age of 5 to 17, and is free for all citizens. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more exclusive and often bilingual education, with some institutions following international curricula such as the **International Baccalaureate**.

The availability of international schools in Seychelles is limited, but there are a few institutions that cater to the needs of expatriate families. These schools often follow international curricula and offer a high-quality education, but at a significantly higher cost than public or private schools. The quality of education in Seychelles is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on **literacy** and **numeracy**. However, there are some concerns about the **equity** of the education system, with some schools in rural areas lacking resources and infrastructure.
