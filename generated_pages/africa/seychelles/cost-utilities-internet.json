However, costs can fluctuate depending on seasonal variation, with higher demand during the peak tourist season from December to April. The Seychelles government has implemented measures to stabilize utility prices, including subsidies for low-income households and a tariff structure that incentivizes energy-efficient practices.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Seychelles is generally good, with a high level of access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there may be occasional disruptions to services due to maintenance or weather-related events. The utility sector is regulated by the Seychelles Energy Commission, which oversees the provision of electricity, water, and telecommunications services. The commission sets tariffs and monitors the performance of utility providers to ensure that they meet standards for quality and reliability.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane or LPG) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in rent or separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$160** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | Seychelles Telecom, Cable & Wireless |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 50-100 Mbps | Seychelles Telecom, Cable & Wireless |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Seychelles Telecom, Cable & Wireless |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Seychelles Telecom, Cable & Wireless |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Seychelles Telecom, Cable & Wireless |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, contact the relevant provider (e.g. Seychelles Telecom for internet and phone, Seychelles Water and Sewerage Company for water) and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Consider prepaid electricity options, which can help you budget and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Choose a reputable internet provider that offers reliable speeds and good customer service.\n- Take advantage of **energy-efficient** practices, such as using LED light bulbs and turning off appliances when not in use, to reduce your utility bills.\n- Compare prices and plans from different providers to find the best deal for your needs and budget.",
