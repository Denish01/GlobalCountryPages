[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Seychelles is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The president has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the cabinet and dissolve the National Assembly. The **legislative branch** consists of a unicameral National Assembly, composed of 34 members who are elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The National Assembly is responsible for passing laws, approving the budget, and exercising parliamentary oversight. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, and subordinate courts.

The Seychelles government is a **unitary system**, where the central government has authority over the entire territory. The country is divided into 25 administrative districts, each with its own district administrator. The government has implemented various measures to promote **decentralization** and empower local communities, including the establishment of district councils and the allocation of funds for local development projects.

The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Constitution, which provides for checks and balances between the three branches of government. The president, for example, can dissolve the National Assembly, but the Assembly can also impeach the president with a two-thirds majority vote. The judiciary is independent and can review the constitutionality of laws and government actions.
