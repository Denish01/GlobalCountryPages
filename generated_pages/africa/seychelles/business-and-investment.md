The business environment in Seychelles is generally favorable, with a government that actively encourages foreign investment. The country has a relatively low level of bureaucracy, and the government has implemented various measures to simplify the process of starting and running a business. However, as with many small island nations, Seychelles is vulnerable to external economic shocks and has a limited domestic market. The government has also taken steps to reduce corruption, but it remains a concern in certain areas, such as procurement and licensing.

The government's attitude towards foreign investment is positive, with a range of incentives and benefits available to investors. These include tax breaks, investment allowances, and streamlined procedures for obtaining necessary permits and licenses. The Seychelles Investment Board is the primary agency responsible for promoting investment and providing support to investors.

Additionally, the country's infrastructure, while improving, can be limited in certain areas, such as transportation and telecommunications.
