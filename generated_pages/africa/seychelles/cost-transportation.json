The main modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and rental cars, with most people relying on buses and taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is generally good, with buses covering most areas of the main islands, including Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue. However, the frequency and coverage of buses can vary depending on the time of day and the island.\n\nThe lack of a comprehensive rail network and the limited availability of ride-hailing services outside of the capital, Victoria, can make it challenging to get around without a car. Nevertheless, the scenic beauty of the islands and the relatively short distances between destinations make walking and cycling attractive options for shorter journeys. Additionally, many hotels and resorts offer shuttle services to and from the airport, making it easier for tourists to get around without having to worry about transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $30 | Good coverage of main islands, including Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used for shorter journeys |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $1.50 | $10-$20 | Available throughout the main islands |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5 | $1.50 | $10-$20 | Bolt and Uber available, but limited outside of Victoria |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $30-$50 | To city center, depending on the island and time of day |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 |  |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 |  |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on the rental company and season |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking spaces available, especially in Victoria |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, as there are no toll roads in Seychelles |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mainly between Mahé and Praslin |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route between Mahé and Praslin, depending on the airline and season |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass, which can be used on buses and some taxis.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Bolt and Uber to get around, especially in Victoria, where they are more widely available.\n- Always negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before starting your journey, especially if you're not using a metered taxi.\n- Be aware of the limited parking spaces available, especially in Victoria, and consider using public transportation or walking whenever possible.\n- If you plan to rent a car, book in advance to ensure availability, especially during peak season.\n- Consider using the **Seychelles Public Transport Corporation** website or app to plan your journey and get the latest information on bus schedules and routes.",
