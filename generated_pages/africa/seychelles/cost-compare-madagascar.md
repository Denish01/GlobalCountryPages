[SECTION] Overview: Seychelles vs Madagascar [/SECTION]
The Seychelles and Madagascar are two island nations located off the coast of East Africa, but they have distinct economic profiles. Seychelles is a high-income economy with a strong tourism industry, while Madagascar is a low-income economy with a growing agricultural sector. As a result, Seychelles tends to have higher prices for goods and services, particularly when it comes to accommodation, food, and transportation. On the other hand, Madagascar offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower costs for housing, food, and other necessities. Overall, Madagascar is around 30-50% cheaper than Seychelles, making it a more attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Seychelles has a more developed economy, with a strong focus on tourism and financial services, which drives up prices for goods and services. In contrast, Madagascar has a more traditional economy, with a focus on agriculture and manufacturing, which keeps prices lower. Additionally, Seychelles has a smaller population and a more limited supply of goods and services, which can drive up prices due to scarcity. In Madagascar, the larger population and more extensive supply of goods and services help to keep prices lower.
