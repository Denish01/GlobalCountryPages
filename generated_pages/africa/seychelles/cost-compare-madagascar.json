Seychelles is a high-income economy with a strong tourism industry, while Madagascar is a low-income economy with a growing agricultural sector. As a result, Seychelles tends to have higher prices for goods and services, particularly when it comes to accommodation, food, and transportation. On the other hand, Madagascar offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower costs for housing, food, and other necessities. Overall, Madagascar is around 30-50% cheaper than Seychelles, making it a more attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Seychelles has a more developed economy, with a strong focus on tourism and financial services, which drives up prices for goods and services. In contrast, Madagascar has a more traditional economy, with a focus on agriculture and manufacturing, which keeps prices lower. Additionally, Seychelles has a smaller population and a more limited supply of goods and services, which can drive up prices due to scarcity. In Madagascar, the larger population and more extensive supply of goods and services help to keep prices lower.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Seychelles (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 250 | 68% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 150 | 70% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 500 | 66% cheaper in Madagascar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Seychelles (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 3 | 80% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 200 | 50 | 75% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 1 | 80% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Coffee | 3 | 1 | 66% cheaper in Madagascar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Seychelles (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 10 | 80% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 0.5 | 75% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 0.8 | 33% cheaper in Madagascar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Seychelles (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 30 | 80% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 20 | 60% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper in Madagascar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Seychelles (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 400 | 66% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Mid-Range | 2,000 | 800 | 60% cheaper in Madagascar |\n| Comfortable | 3,500 | 1,500 | 57% cheaper in Madagascar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Seychelles is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end tourism activities, such as luxury resorts and diving excursions\n  - International flights and connectivity\n  - High-quality healthcare and medical services\n  - Modern amenities and infrastructure, such as shopping malls and restaurants\n- **Madagascar is cheaper for:**\n  - Accommodation, including apartments and houses\n  - Food, including groceries and dining out\n  - Transportation, including taxis and public transport\n  - Utilities, including electricity, water, and internet\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Madagascar offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower costs for accommodation, food, and transportation.
