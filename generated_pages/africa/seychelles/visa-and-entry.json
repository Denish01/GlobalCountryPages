The country's visa-free access policy is one of the most liberal in the region, making it an attractive destination for tourists and business travelers alike. Whether you're planning a short trip or an extended stay, it's essential to understand the visa requirements and regulations that apply to your nationality and purpose of visit.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Indian Citizens | On Arrival | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds |\n| Chinese Citizens | On Arrival | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Seychelles visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival, depending on their nationality.
