The country's food prices are driven up by the cost of transportation, import duties, and a relatively high standard of living. Eating out is a popular activity in Seychelles, with a mix of Creole, French, and international cuisine available. However, home cooking is also common, especially among locals, as it is often more affordable and allows for the use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The **Seychellois Creole** cuisine is a fusion of different flavors and spices, and is a key part of the country's cultural identity.\n\nThe food prices in Seychelles are relatively high compared to other African countries, but they are still lower than in many European or North American destinations. The **inflation rate** in Seychelles is low, at 0.3% in 2024, which means that food prices are relatively stable. However, the country's **GDP per capita** is high, at $33,239 in 2024, which reflects the relatively high standard of living and the corresponding high food prices. Overall, Seychelles offers a unique and flavorful dining experience, with a mix of local and international cuisine available at various price points.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 35 SCR | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | 20 SCR | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 25 SCR | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 15 SCR | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 80 SCR | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 130 SCR | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 65 SCR | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 30 SCR | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 20 SCR | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.20 | 15 SCR | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 100 SCR | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 10 SCR | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (coconut curry, fish cakes) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$30 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $100-$150 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Seychelles can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market.

It's worth noting that bargaining is not typically expected at supermarkets, but it is more common at local markets, especially for bulk purchases.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to **haggle** politely and to be respectful of the vendors. You can often get a better price by buying in bulk or by shopping during the off-season. Additionally, local markets often offer a wider selection of **fresh produce**, including fruits, vegetables, and seafood, which can be a great way to experience the local cuisine and to support the local economy. Overall, a combination of supermarket and local market shopping can offer the best of both worlds, with a wide selection of goods and a chance to experience the local culture.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **cheapest way to eat** in Seychelles is to buy **street food** or to eat at **local eateries**, which offer a range of affordable and delicious options.\n- **Local staples** like rice, beans, and fresh produce are often good value and can be used to make a range of dishes.\n- **Fresh seafood** is abundant in Seychelles and can be a great way to experience the local cuisine, especially when bought directly from the fishermen or at local markets.\n- It's a good idea to **avoid buying imported goods**, especially if you're on a budget, as they can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- **Cooking at home** can be a great way to save money and to experience the local cuisine, especially if you're staying in a self-catering apartment or house.\n- **Local markets** are a great place to find **fresh produce** and to experience the local culture, and can be a good alternative to supermarkets, especially for bulk purchases.",
