# The Truth About Seychelles - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
The Seychelles, an archipelago of 115 islands, has a rich and diverse history. The first recorded sighting of the islands was by European explorers in 1502, when Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese navigator, spotted the islands. However, it was not until 1756 that the French formally claimed the islands, naming them after Jean Moreau de Séchelles, the French Minister of Finance. The French established the first settlement on the island of Mahé in 1770, and the islands became a French colony. 
During the French colonial period, the Seychelles developed a unique culture, with the French introducing their language, customs, and religion to the islands. The British also took an interest in the Seychelles, and in 1814, the islands were ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Paris. The Seychelles remained a British colony until it gained independence on June 29, 1976. 
The early years of independence were marked by a struggle for stability, with the country experiencing a coup in 1977. However, since then, the Seychelles has developed into a stable democracy, with a diverse economy and a strong focus on conservation and tourism. The country has also maintained its unique cultural heritage, with a blend of French, British, and African influences. 
Today, the Seychelles is a **sovereign** nation, with a population of approximately 0.1 million people, and a diverse economy based on tourism, fishing, and agriculture. The country has a **presidential system**, with a president serving as head of state and government.
