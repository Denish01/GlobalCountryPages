[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands off the eastern coast of Africa, and the main entry point is Seychelles International Airport, located on the island of Mahé. The airport is a hub for Air Seychelles and receives direct flights from major airlines such as Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Ethiopian Airlines, as well as charter flights from Europe and Asia. There are no overland entry points, as Seychelles is an island nation, and visitors typically arrive by air or sea.

To get to Seychelles, you can fly into Seychelles International Airport from major hubs such as Dubai, Doha, Addis Ababa, or Nairobi, or take a connecting flight from Europe or Asia. Alternatively, you can arrive by sea on a cruise ship or a private yacht, with several ports of entry on the islands of Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue. It is essential to research and book your flights or sea travel in advance, especially during peak season, to ensure availability and the best rates.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
For domestic travel within Seychelles, you can use the services of Air Seychelles, which operates flights between the islands of Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue. The main routes are between Seychelles International Airport and Praslin Island Airport, as well as between Praslin and La Digue. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak season, and you can expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year. It is also possible to charter a private plane or helicopter for a more exclusive and flexible travel experience.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Seychelles has no rail network, and the only way to get around the islands is by road, sea, or air. This means that you will not find any trains or high-speed rail options, and you will need to rely on other modes of transportation to explore the islands.

The buses are generally reliable and affordable, with fares starting from around $1-$2, depending on the route and distance.
