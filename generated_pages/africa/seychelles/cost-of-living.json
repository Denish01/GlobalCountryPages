[/SECTION]\nSeychelles is considered one of the most expensive countries in Africa, with a high cost of living due to its remote island location and limited resources. The country's economy is largely driven by tourism, which has led to a surge in prices for accommodations, food, and activities. Compared to its neighbors, Madagascar and Mauritius, Seychelles is significantly more expensive, with prices often rivaling those found in Western Europe or North America. Visitors to Seychelles should be prepared for high costs, particularly when it comes to accommodations and food.\n\nThe high cost of living in Seychelles is also driven by the country's reliance on imports, which can be expensive due to transportation costs. Additionally, the government has implemented various taxes and fees to help conserve the country's unique environment and support the local economy. While Seychelles can be a pricey destination, its stunning natural beauty, diverse wildlife, and rich culture make it a unique and rewarding experience for visitors.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-60 | Basic rooms with shared facilities, often in guesthouses or small hotels |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $100-250 | Comfortable rooms with private facilities, often including breakfast and amenities like pools or gyms |\n| Luxury/Resort | $300-600 | High-end rooms and villas with luxurious amenities, often including fine dining and water sports |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $800-2,000 | City center apartments can be expensive, while those outside of town may be more affordable, but still pricey |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-80 |\n| Fine Dining | $80-150 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.50-1.00 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1.50-3.00 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20-1.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 800 | 1,500 | 2,500 |\n| Food | 500 | 800 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 150 | 250 | 350 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **1,750** | **3,050** | **4,950** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting Seychelles during the off-season (April-May or September-November) to take advantage of lower prices for accommodations and flights.\n- Look for apartments or guesthouses outside of the city center to save on rent.\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls to enjoy affordable and delicious Creole cuisine.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce transport costs.\n- Take advantage of free activities like visiting the local markets or exploring the beautiful beaches and nature reserves.\n- Book accommodations and flights well in advance to secure the best prices and availability.",
