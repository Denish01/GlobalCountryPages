[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Seychelles has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival.

To extend their stay, tourists must apply for an extension at least 24 hours before their current visa expires.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may require a visa, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit.
