Guinea has a higher GDP per capita and a more diversified economy, with a strong mining sector, while Mali's economy is more reliant on agriculture. Despite these differences, both countries have a relatively low cost of living compared to other countries in the region. However, Guinea is generally cheaper than Mali, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The cost of living in Guinea is around 15% lower than in Mali, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Guinea's economy has been growing steadily in recent years, driven by investments in the mining sector, while Mali's economy has been affected by security concerns and political instability. As a result, Guinea has a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of goods and services available, which can affect the cost of living. However, Mali's economy is more reliant on informal trade and traditional industries, which can make it more challenging to compare prices and costs between the two countries.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea (USD) | Mali (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 250 | 20% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 180 | 17% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 500 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea (USD) | Mali (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 6 | 17% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 120 | 17% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 2.5 | 20% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 1.2 | 17% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea (USD) | Mali (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 12 | 17% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.6 | 17% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 0.9 | 11% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea (USD) | Mali (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 60 | 17% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 25 | 20% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 12 | 17% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Guinea (USD) | Mali (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 500 | 20% |\n| Mid-Range | 700 | 900 | 22% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,500 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Guinea is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 20% lower than in Mali\n- Food and dining, with meal prices up to 17% lower than in Mali\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices up to 17% lower than in Mali\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 20% lower than in Mali\n- **Mali is cheaper for:**\n- Certain types of groceries, such as rice and beans, which can be up to 10% cheaper than in Guinea\n- Traditional clothing and handicrafts, which can be up to 15% cheaper than in Guinea\n- Local transportation, such as bush taxis, which can be up to 10% cheaper than in Guinea\n- Certain types of accommodation, such as guesthouses, which can be up to 10% cheaper than in Guinea\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nGuinea offers better value for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.
