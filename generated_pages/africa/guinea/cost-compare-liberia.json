Guinea has a relatively higher GDP per capita and a more stable inflation rate, which contributes to its lower cost of living. Liberia, on the other hand, has a lower GDP per capita and a higher inflation rate, making it more expensive for everyday items and services. The cost of living in Guinea is generally lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more affordable.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Guinea has a more diversified economy, with a strong mining sector and a growing agricultural industry, which helps to keep prices stable. Liberia, however, has a more limited economy, with a heavy reliance on imports, which can drive up prices.
