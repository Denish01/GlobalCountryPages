[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Guinea has a limited but developing transportation network, with most people relying on **minibuses**, **taxis**, and **motorcycles** to get around. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Conakry having a more comprehensive network than other urban areas. However, the lack of a well-organized public transportation system means that many people rely on informal modes of transport, such as **shared taxis** and **bush taxis**. The road network is also limited, with many roads in poor condition, especially during the rainy season.

The main transportation modes in Guinea are road-based, with a few **ferry services** operating on the coast and rivers. The country's geography, with its mountainous terrain and limited infrastructure, makes it challenging to develop a comprehensive transportation network. However, efforts are being made to improve the road network and expand public transportation services, including the introduction of **new bus services** and **ride-hailing apps**. Despite these challenges, Guinea's transportation sector is growing, with an increasing number of **private transport operators** offering services, including **car rentals** and **tourist transportation**.
