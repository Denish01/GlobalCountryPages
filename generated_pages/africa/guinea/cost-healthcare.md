[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Guinea has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The healthcare system in Guinea is not universal, and many people rely on traditional medicine or self-medication due to the high cost of healthcare. 

The need for insurance in Guinea is significant, especially for foreigners and those who can afford it. While there are some local insurance options available, they may not provide adequate coverage, and many people opt for international health insurance that covers them globally. This is especially important for emergency medical evacuations, which may be necessary due to the limited medical resources available in Guinea. The high out-of-pocket spend in Guinea also highlights the need for insurance, as many people are forced to pay for healthcare expenses themselves.
