  "content": "Guinea is generally cheaper than Guinea-Bissau, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGuinea GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,390\nGuinea-Bissau GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,950\nGuinea Inflation Rate: 7.5%\nGuinea-Bissau Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Guinea\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Guinea vs Guinea-Bissau [/SECTION]\nGuinea and Guinea-Bissau are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Guinea has a relatively higher GDP per capita and a more diverse economy, driven by mining, agriculture, and manufacturing. In contrast, Guinea-Bissau's economy is primarily based on agriculture and fishing. The cost of living in Guinea is generally lower, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being more affordable. However, Guinea-Bissau has a lower inflation rate, which can contribute to a more stable cost of living.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Guinea's economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by investments in the mining sector. This growth has led to an increase in demand for goods and services, which has, in turn, driven up prices. On the other hand, Guinea-Bissau's economy has been relatively stagnant, with a high dependence on foreign aid and a limited private sector. As a result, prices for goods and services in Guinea-Bissau are generally lower, but the country's economy is more vulnerable to external shocks.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea (USD) | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 200 | 25% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea (USD) | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 7 | 28% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 70 | 28% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea (USD) | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea (USD) | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 70 | 28% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Guinea-Bissau |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Guinea (USD) | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper in Guinea |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% cheaper in Guinea |\n| Comfortable | 1,500 | 2,500 | 40% cheaper in Guinea |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Guinea is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices being 25-33% lower\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries being 28-50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with monthly transit passes and taxi fares being 33-50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices being 28-33% lower\n- **Guinea-Bissau is cheaper for:**\n- Some imported goods, due to its proximity to the port city of Bissau\n- Certain types of accommodation, such as guesthouses and hostels\n- Local handicrafts and souvenirs, which can be found at lower prices in Guinea-Bissau\n- Traditional meals and street food, which can be more affordable in Guinea-Bissau\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nGuinea offers better value for expats, students, and families due to its lower cost of living and more affordable accommodation options.
