[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Guinea is overseen by the Ministry of Education and consists of three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, also known as **enseignement primaire**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 12 and is divided into two cycles. Secondary education, or **enseignement secondaire**, is divided into two levels: lower secondary and upper secondary, and is not compulsory. Tertiary education, or **enseignement supérieur**, is provided by universities and other institutions, and is relatively underdeveloped compared to other countries in the region.

The quality of education in Guinea is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure, such as classrooms, desks, and educational materials. Additionally, there is a shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in rural areas. Public education is generally considered to be of lower quality than private education, which is often expensive and inaccessible to many Guineans. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve teacher training and curriculum development.
