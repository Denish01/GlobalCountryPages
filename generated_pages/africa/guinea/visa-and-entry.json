[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nGuinea has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of certain African countries, such as ECOWAS member states, can enter Guinea visa-free, while others may need to obtain a visa in advance or on arrival. The country's visa policy aims to balance the need to facilitate travel and trade with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.\n\nGuinea offers visa-free access to citizens of several countries, including ECOWAS member states, such as Senegal, Mali, and Sierra Leone. However, citizens of most other countries, including the US, UK, and EU member states, require a visa to enter Guinea.
