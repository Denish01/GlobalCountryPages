[SECTION] How Guinea Is Divided [/SECTION]
Guinea is a sovereign country located in West Africa, divided into 8 regions, which are further subdivided into 33 prefectures. The regions are Boké, Conakry, Faranah, Kankan, Kindia, Labé, Mamou, and Nzérékoré. Each region has its own administrative capital and is responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. The prefectures, on the other hand, are smaller administrative units that are responsible for managing local services and implementing national policies at the local level.

The administrative structure of Guinea is designed to promote decentralization and local autonomy, allowing regions and prefectures to manage their own affairs and respond to local needs. However, the central government in Conakry still plays a significant role in setting national policies and providing financial support to the regions and prefectures.
