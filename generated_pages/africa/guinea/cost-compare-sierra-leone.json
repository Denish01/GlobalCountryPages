Both countries have a lower cost of living compared to other West African nations, but Guinea's larger economy and more developed infrastructure contribute to its relatively lower prices. The main difference in costs between the two countries lies in the prices of rent, food, and transportation, with Guinea offering more affordable options in these categories.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Guinea has a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on mining and agriculture, which contributes to its relatively higher GDP per capita. Sierra Leone, on the other hand, has a smaller economy that is more reliant on mining and agriculture, which can lead to price fluctuations and a higher cost of living.
