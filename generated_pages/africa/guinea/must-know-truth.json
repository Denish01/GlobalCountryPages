  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nGuinea, a sovereign country located in West Africa, has a rich and diverse history. The country was first inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the Fulani, Mandinka, and Susu, before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1890, Guinea became a French colony, and it remained under French rule until it gained independence on October 2, 1958. The country's first president, Sékou Touré, played a significant role in Guinea's struggle for independence and served as the country's leader until his death in 1984.\n\nDuring the colonial period, Guinea's economy was primarily based on agriculture, with a focus on crops such as coffee, bananas, and pineapples. The country's natural resources, including iron ore, bauxite, and diamonds, were also exploited by the French. After independence, Guinea's economy continued to rely heavily on agriculture and natural resources, with the government attempting to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on foreign aid.\n\nGuinea's post-independence history has been marked by periods of instability and authoritarian rule. In 1984, Lansana Conté seized power in a military coup and ruled the country until his death in 2008. Conté's regime was marked by human rights abuses and corruption, and the country's economy suffered as a result. In 2010, Guinea held its first democratic elections, which were won by Alpha Condé, who served as president until 2021.\n\nToday, Guinea is classified as a **presidential republic**, with a **multiparty system**. The country's government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial.
