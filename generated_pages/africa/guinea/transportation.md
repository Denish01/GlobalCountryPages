[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Guinea has one main international airport, Conakry International Airport (CKY), which is located about 10 kilometers from the city center of Conakry. The airport receives direct flights from major European cities such as Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam, as well as flights from other West African countries like Senegal, Mali, and Ivory Coast. If you're traveling from outside of Africa, you may need to connect through a European or other African city to reach Conakry. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from neighboring countries like Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

For those traveling overland, it's essential to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations, as they can change frequently. Additionally, be prepared for long wait times and potential delays at the border. It's also recommended to hire a reputable **taxi** or **bus** service to transport you from the border to your final destination, as the road conditions can be poor and the journey can be lengthy.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Guinea has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating within the country. The main domestic airline is **Air Guinee**, which offers flights from Conakry to other major cities like Labé, Mamou, and Kankan. However, the frequency and reliability of these flights can be unpredictable, and it's essential to book in advance to secure a seat. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $300 USD, depending on the route and airline. It's recommended to book through a local travel agency or directly with the airline to ensure the best rates and to stay up-to-date with any changes to the flight schedule.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Guinea does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option within the country. However, there are plans to develop a railway system in the future, which would connect Conakry to other major cities and neighboring countries. For now, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and domestic flights, to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are several intercity bus companies operating in Guinea, including **SOTRAM** and **STG**, which offer services from Conakry to other major cities like Labé, Mamou, and Kankan. The quality of the buses can vary, but most are relatively comfortable and reliable. The costs for bus travel are generally affordable, ranging from $10 to $30 USD, depending on the route and company. However, the journey times can be long due to the poor road conditions, and it's essential to be prepared for delays and potential breakdowns.
