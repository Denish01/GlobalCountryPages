[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Guinea is a low-income economy with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of approximately $15.7 billion. The country's economic development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Guinea's economy is primarily driven by the agricultural and mining sectors, with a growing manufacturing sector. The country has significant natural resources, including bauxite, iron ore, and gold, which are the main drivers of the economy. However, the economy is also vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related disruptions to agricultural production.

Guinea's economic trajectory has been marked by periods of growth and decline. The country has implemented various economic reforms aimed at improving the business environment, increasing investment, and promoting economic growth. Despite these efforts, the economy remains challenged by inadequate infrastructure, corruption, and a lack of economic diversification. The government has prioritized the development of the agricultural and mining sectors, as well as the promotion of private sector investment, to drive economic growth and reduce poverty.

The Guinean economy is also heavily reliant on foreign aid and investment. The country has received significant support from international organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to help stabilize the economy and promote economic growth. However, the country's economic development is also hindered by a lack of economic infrastructure, including roads, ports, and energy facilities. The government has recognized the need to invest in these areas to promote economic growth and reduce poverty.
