[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Guinea is still in the process of development, with the majority of the population relying on mobile networks for access. The average internet speed in Guinea is approximately 5 Mbps download, which can be slow for streaming and other data-intensive activities. There is a significant urban-rural divide in terms of internet access, with cities like Conakry having more reliable and faster connections compared to rural areas. The reliability of the internet can also be a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions reported, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.

Despite these challenges, the Guinean government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber-optic cables and mobile network upgrades. However, more needs to be done to address the digital divide and provide universal access to reliable and affordable internet services. For visitors, it is essential to research and plan ahead to ensure they have a reliable means of staying connected, whether through a local SIM card, portable WiFi hotspot, or other alternative solutions.
