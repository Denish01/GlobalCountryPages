This growth rate is relatively high, which can put pressure on the country's resources and infrastructure. The median age in Guinea is 19.4 years, indicating a relatively young population. The urban population accounts for approximately 37.4% of the total population, with the majority of people living in rural areas. The population density is around 58.3 people per square kilometer, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region.\n\nGuinea has experienced significant urbanization in recent years, with many people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities. The capital city, Conakry, is the largest city in the country and has a population of over 1.5 million people. However, the rapid urbanization has also led to challenges such as overcrowding, poverty, and inadequate access to basic services like healthcare and education. Migration patterns in Guinea are largely driven by economic factors, with many people moving to neighboring countries like Senegal and Mali in search of work.\n\nThe population of Guinea is also affected by various social and economic factors, including poverty, education, and healthcare. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving access to education and healthcare, but there is still much work to be done.
