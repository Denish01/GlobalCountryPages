Guinea has experienced significant urbanization in recent years, with many people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities. The capital city, Conakry, is the largest city in the country and has a population of over 1.5 million people. However, the rapid urbanization has also led to challenges such as overcrowding, poverty, and inadequate access to basic services like healthcare and education.

The population of Guinea is also affected by various social and economic factors, including poverty, education, and healthcare. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving access to education and healthcare, but there is still much work to be done.
