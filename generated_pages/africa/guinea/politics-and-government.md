[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Guinea is structured around the principles of a unitary state, with a strong central government and limited powers granted to regional authorities. The **separation of powers** is established between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, with checks and balances in place to prevent any one branch from dominating the others. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and serves as both the head of state and head of government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, a unicameral body with 114 seats, where members are elected by proportional representation for five-year terms.

The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and lower courts. The Supreme Court has the final say on matters of constitutional interpretation and has the power to review laws and government actions for constitutionality. The **civil law system** in Guinea is based on French law, with some modifications to reflect local customs and traditions. The government has also established a number of **independent agencies**, such as the National Electoral Commission and the Anti-Corruption Agency, to oversee key aspects of governance.

The political system in Guinea has undergone significant changes in recent years, with a **transition to democracy** in 2010, following decades of authoritarian rule. The country has made significant progress in establishing democratic institutions and holding regular elections, but challenges remain, including **corruption**, **inequality**, and **poverty**. The government has implemented a number of reforms aimed at addressing these challenges, including the establishment of a new **anti-corruption agency** and the implementation of measures to increase **transparency** and **accountability** in government.
