# Guinea Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Guinea's infrastructure is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in access to electricity, water, and telecommunications, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 34% of population
Internet Penetration: 12%
Road Network: 44,438 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: 1,086 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 1, the Port of Conakry
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Guinea's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has made efforts to improve its infrastructure in recent years, with investments in the energy and transportation sectors. However, the gap between urban and rural areas remains significant, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of a national infrastructure plan and partnerships with international organizations to support infrastructure development.

The country's infrastructure challenges are further complicated by its rugged terrain, which makes it difficult to build and maintain roads and other infrastructure. Additionally, Guinea's economy has been impacted by the Ebola outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have slowed down infrastructure development efforts. Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to improving the country's infrastructure, recognizing its critical role in driving economic growth and improving living standards.

Guinea's infrastructure development is also hindered by a lack of funding and capacity. The government relies heavily on external funding to support infrastructure projects, which can be unpredictable and subject to changing donor priorities. Furthermore, the country's institutions and regulatory frameworks are still evolving, which can create uncertainty and risks for investors. To address these challenges, the government is working to strengthen its institutions and improve the business environment, including by establishing a one-stop shop for investors and streamlining regulatory procedures.
