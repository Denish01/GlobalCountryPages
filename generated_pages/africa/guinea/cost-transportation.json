The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Conakry having a more comprehensive network than other urban areas. However, the lack of a well-organized public transportation system means that many people rely on informal modes of transport, such as **shared taxis** and **bush taxis**. The road network is also limited, with many roads in poor condition, especially during the rainy season.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Guinea are road-based, with a few **ferry services** operating on the coast and rivers. The country's geography, with its mountainous terrain and limited infrastructure, makes it challenging to develop a comprehensive transportation network. However, efforts are being made to improve the road network and expand public transportation services, including the introduction of **new bus services** and **ride-hailing apps**. Despite these challenges, Guinea's transportation sector is growing, with an increasing number of **private transport operators** offering services, including **car rentals** and **tourist transportation**.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, variable quality |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Extensive network, variable quality |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00-$3.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Africab, Allo Taxi |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, variable prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Variable prices |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00-$1.30 | Variable prices |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, variable prices |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Variable prices, limited services |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes, variable prices |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Africab or Allo Taxi for convenient and affordable transportation.\n- **Negotiate taxi fares** before starting your journey to avoid overcharging.\n- **Be cautious** when using public transportation, especially at night, and avoid carrying large amounts of cash.\n- Consider **renting a car** for long-distance travel or for exploring rural areas.\n- **Check the weather forecast** before embarking on a journey, as roads can become impassable during the rainy season.\n- Use **local currency (GNF)** for transactions, as not all businesses accept foreign currency.",
