  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Guinea can vary significantly depending on whether you use public or private facilities, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $59 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 54.4% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 117 or 18\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: GNF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGuinea has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The healthcare system in Guinea is not universal, and many people rely on traditional medicine or self-medication due to the high cost of healthcare. \n\nThe need for insurance in Guinea is significant, especially for foreigners and those who can afford it. While there are some local insurance options available, they may not provide adequate coverage, and many people opt for international health insurance that covers them globally. This is especially important for emergency medical evacuations, which may be necessary due to the limited medical resources available in Guinea. The high out-of-pocket spend in Guinea also highlights the need for insurance, as many people are forced to pay for healthcare expenses themselves.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Public hospitals often have long wait times and limited resources |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Private clinics often have more experienced specialists |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-70 | Private dental clinics often have better equipment and more experienced dentists |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-50 | Public hospitals may not have the latest equipment for eye exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $30-70 | Private labs often have faster turnaround times and more accurate results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Public hospitals may not have the necessary equipment or staff for emergency care |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-100 | Private hospitals often have better facilities and more experienced staff |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-500 | Private clinics often have more experienced surgeons and better equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-500 | Private hospitals often have better facilities and more experienced staff for childbirth |\n| MRI Scan | $100-300 | Private clinics often have more modern equipment and faster turnaround times |\n| X-Ray | $10-50 | Public hospitals may have older equipment and longer wait times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-20 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays, but often has limited coverage and high deductibles |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Covers a wide range of medical expenses, including surgeries and specialist consultations, with lower deductibles and better coverage |\n| International / Expat | $100-300 | Covers medical expenses globally, including emergency medical evacuations, with comprehensive coverage and low deductibles |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **painkillers** can be found at local pharmacies for $5-10\n- **Prescription medications** may require a doctor's prescription, which can cost $10-20\n- Pharmacy availability varies by city, with more options available in **Conakry**\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but the quality and authenticity of these medications can vary\n- Some pharmacies may not have the latest or most effective medications, especially for chronic conditions\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary medications with you when traveling to Guinea, as they may not be readily available\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 117 or 18 for emergency services.
