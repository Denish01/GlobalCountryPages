The **Mali Empire**, which rose to power in the 13th century, played a significant role in the region's early history, with its influence extending over a vast area of West Africa. As the Mali Empire declined, other kingdoms and empires, such as the **Songhai Empire**, rose to power, shaping the region's cultural, economic, and political landscape. The arrival of European colonizers in the 19th century marked a significant turning point in Guinea's history, as the country became a French colony, known as French Guinea.\n\nThe colonial period had a profound impact on Guinea, with the French exploiting the country's natural resources and imposing their language and culture on the local population. The struggle for independence began to gain momentum in the mid-20th century, with nationalist leaders such as **Sékou Touré** playing a key role in the movement. Guinea gained independence from France on October 2, 1958, becoming the first French colony in West Africa to do so. The post-independence period was marked by significant challenges, including economic struggles, political instability, and regional conflicts.

The country has a rich cultural heritage, with over 24 ethnic groups, each with their own language, customs, and traditions. The **Fula**, **Mandingo**, and **Susu** are among the largest ethnic groups, and they have all played a significant role in shaping Guinea's history and culture.
