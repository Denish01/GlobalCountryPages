[SECTION] Overview: Guinea vs Guinea-Bissau [/SECTION]
Guinea and Guinea-Bissau are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Guinea has a relatively higher GDP per capita and a more diverse economy, driven by mining, agriculture, and manufacturing. In contrast, Guinea-Bissau's economy is primarily based on agriculture and fishing. The cost of living in Guinea is generally lower, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being more affordable. However, Guinea-Bissau has a lower inflation rate, which can contribute to a more stable cost of living.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Guinea's economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by investments in the mining sector. This growth has led to an increase in demand for goods and services, which has, in turn, driven up prices. On the other hand, Guinea-Bissau's economy has been relatively stagnant, with a high dependence on foreign aid and a limited private sector. As a result, prices for goods and services in Guinea-Bissau are generally lower, but the country's economy is more vulnerable to external shocks.
