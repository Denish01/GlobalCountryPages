[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Guinea has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by dry and cooler weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). This season is ideal for traveling and exploring the country, as the roads are more accessible and the weather is more pleasant. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it more challenging to travel and explore the country.

The climate in Guinea varies depending on the region, with the coastal areas tend to be more humid and hot, while the mountainous regions are cooler and more temperate. The Fouta Djallon highlands, located in the center of the country, have a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 20°C (59°F to 68°F). The dry season is the best time to visit the highlands, as the weather is mild and pleasant, making it ideal for hiking and trekking.

The seasons in Guinea also affect the country's festivals and events, with many of them taking place during the dry season. The country's Independence Day, for example, is celebrated on October 2nd, but the festivities often start in September and continue until November. The wet season, on the other hand, is a time for agricultural activities, with many farmers planting and harvesting their crops during this period.
