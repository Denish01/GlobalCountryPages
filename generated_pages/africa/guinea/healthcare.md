[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Guinea is a mixed model that includes both public and private providers. The public sector is the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population, with a network of government-run hospitals and health centers. However, the public system is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of access to quality medical care, especially in rural areas. The private sector, on the other hand, offers better quality care, but it is often expensive and out of reach for many Guineans. The quality of care in Guinea is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, with a [RATING] 2/5 rating. Urban areas, such as the capital Conakry, have better access to healthcare services, including specialized care and advanced medical equipment, while rural areas often rely on basic health centers with limited resources.

The Guinean government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, but more work is needed to address the significant challenges facing the sector. One of the major challenges is the shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. Many healthcare workers have left the country in search of better opportunities, leaving a significant gap in the healthcare workforce. Additionally, the country's healthcare infrastructure is often in disrepair, with many facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies.

Despite these challenges, there are some positive developments in the Guinean healthcare sector. The government has increased its investment in the healthcare system, including the construction of new hospitals and health centers. Additionally, there are a number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations working in Guinea to improve access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas. These efforts are helping to increase access to quality medical care, especially for vulnerable populations such as women and children.
