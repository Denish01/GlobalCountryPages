[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nAngola has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. Currently, only a few countries have visa-free access to Angola, including Portugal, Mozambique, and a few other African nations. Citizens from other countries can obtain a visa on arrival or through the Angolan embassy or consulate in their home country.\n\nThe Angolan government has been working to improve its visa system, introducing an electronic visa (eVisa) system for citizens from certain countries. This has made it easier for tourists and business travelers to obtain a visa and visit the country. However, the requirements and regulations can still be complex, and it's essential to check with the official authorities for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply at the Angolan embassy or consulate |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply at the Angolan embassy or consulate |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Some EU citizens may be eligible for an eVisa |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply at the Angolan embassy or consulate |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply at the Angolan embassy or consulate |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply at the Angolan embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply at the Angolan embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a tourist visa, which is typically valid for 30 days.
