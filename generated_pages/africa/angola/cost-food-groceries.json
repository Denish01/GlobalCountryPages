  "content": "The cost of food in Angola can vary greatly, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant starting from around $5 USD and a monthly grocery budget for one person ranging from $200-$500 USD. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($5 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($30 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($200-$500 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($3 USD)\nCurrency: AOA\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nFood prices in Angola are generally higher compared to the regional average, mainly due to the country's reliance on imports and high transportation costs. The inflation rate of 28.2% in 2024 has also driven up prices, making it challenging for locals and expats to afford basic necessities. Eating out is not a common practice among locals, with many preferring to cook at home due to the high costs of dining out. However, for those who do eat out, there are various options available, ranging from inexpensive restaurants to fine dining establishments.\n\nThe high cost of food in Angola is also attributed to the country's limited agricultural production, which leads to a reliance on imported goods. This, combined with the high inflation rate, has resulted in a significant increase in food prices over the years. Despite these challenges, there are still affordable options available for those who are willing to cook at home and explore local markets. With a GDP per capita PPP of $10,119, many Angolans have a relatively high purchasing power, which has contributed to the growth of the middle class and an increasing demand for high-quality food products.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 1,200 AOA | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | 700 AOA | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 900 AOA | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 550 AOA | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 2,800 AOA | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 4,500 AOA | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 2,200 AOA | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 700 AOA | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 450 AOA | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 350 AOA | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 3,500 AOA | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 450 AOA | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like calulu or funge) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$40 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$6 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, there is a significant price difference between supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices ranging from 10-20% higher than those found at local markets. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, which may be difficult to find at local markets. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and staples at lower prices, making them a more affordable option for many Angolans. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and visitors can expect to haggle over prices to get the best deal.\n\nFor those looking to save money, it's recommended to shop at local markets for fresh produce and staples, and reserve supermarket shopping for imported goods or specialty items. Additionally, buying in bulk and shopping during off-peak hours can also help reduce costs. It's also worth noting that many local markets offer a wide range of traditional dishes and snacks, which can be a great way to experience the local cuisine without breaking the bank. With a little planning and flexibility, it's possible to eat well in Angola without overspending.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Angola is to opt for traditional dishes like **calulu** or **funge**, which can be found at local eateries or street food stalls.\n- **Local staples** like rice, beans, and cassava are good value and can be purchased at local markets.\n- **Fresh produce** like tomatoes, onions, and potatoes are widely available and relatively affordable.\n- It's best to **avoid buying imported goods**, as they tend to be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- **Bargaining** is a common practice at local markets, so be prepared to haggle over prices.\n- For a unique and affordable dining experience, try visiting a **local market** or **street food stall**, where you can sample traditional dishes and drinks.",
