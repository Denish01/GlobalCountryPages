[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Angola is a mixed model, combining public and private providers to deliver healthcare services to its population of over 36 million people. The public sector is the main provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality services, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the majority of the population. In urban areas, such as Luanda, there are more healthcare options available, including private hospitals and clinics, while in rural areas, access to healthcare services is often limited.

The quality of care in Angola varies significantly depending on the provider and location. Public hospitals often struggle with limited resources, outdated equipment, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, resulting in a lower quality of care. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer higher-quality services, with more modern equipment and better-trained staff. However, these services are often expensive and may not be accessible to the majority of the population.

Despite these challenges, the Angolan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new infrastructure and implementing programs to increase access to healthcare services. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality, particularly in rural areas.
