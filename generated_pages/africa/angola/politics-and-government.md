[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Angola is divided into three branches: the **Executive**, **Legislative**, and **Judicial**. The **Executive** branch is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the **Prime Minister**, who is the head of government, and other ministers. The **Legislative** branch is composed of the **National Assembly**, a unicameral body with 220 seats, where members are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **Judicial** branch is independent and composed of the **Supreme Court** and lower courts.

The **Separation of Powers** is enshrined in the **Constitution**, which ensures that each branch has distinct responsibilities and checks on the others. However, the **President** has significant influence over the **Legislative** and **Judicial** branches, which can limit their independence. Angola has a **unitary** system, with a strong central government, but there are also **decentralized** elements, with provinces and municipalities having some autonomy.

The **Constitution** also provides for **political pluralism**, with multiple parties allowed to participate in the political process. However, the **ruling party**, the **MPLA**, has dominated politics since independence in 1975. The **opposition parties** have struggled to gain significant traction, and the political landscape is often characterized by **tensions** between the **ruling party** and the **opposition**.
