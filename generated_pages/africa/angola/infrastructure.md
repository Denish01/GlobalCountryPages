# Angola Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Angola is still developing, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications, but there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 40% of population
Internet Penetration: 13%
Road Network: 73,000 km, with many roads in poor condition
Rail Network: 2,761 km
Major Airports: 11
Major Ports: 3
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Angola's infrastructure development has been hindered by years of civil war and underinvestment, but in recent years, the government has made significant efforts to improve the country's infrastructure. The **National Development Plan** has outlined major investments in roads, railways, and energy generation, with a focus on improving access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Despite these efforts, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic infrastructure. The capital city, Luanda, has seen significant investment in recent years, with new roads, buildings, and amenities being constructed, but other parts of the country remain underdeveloped.

The government has also made efforts to attract foreign investment to help develop the country's infrastructure, with a number of major projects currently underway, including the construction of new roads, railways, and energy generation facilities. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled labor and a complex bureaucracy, which can make it difficult to get projects off the ground. Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to developing the country's infrastructure, and there are signs that progress is being made.

One of the major challenges facing Angola's infrastructure development is the country's vast size and geographical diversity. With a territory of over 1.2 million square kilometers, Angola is a large and sprawling country, and developing infrastructure that covers the entire country is a significant challenge. However, the government is working to address this challenge, with a number of major projects currently underway to improve the country's transportation network and increase access to basic services.
