# Angola History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Angola is a complex and multifaceted narrative that spans thousands of years, from the earliest known inhabitants to the modern era, with key events including the pre-colonial period, colonial rule, independence, and the country's ongoing development.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
Angola's history began with the migration of various **Bantu** tribes to the region around 1000 BC, with these groups developing complex societies and trading networks. The **Kingdom of Kongo**, established in the 14th century, was one of the most prominent pre-colonial states in the area, playing a significant role in the region's politics and economy. In the late 15th century, **Portuguese** explorers arrived in Angola, marking the beginning of the colonial period, which would last for nearly five centuries. Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, but the country was immediately plunged into a devastating civil war that lasted for over two decades.

The pre-colonial period in Angola was characterized by the presence of various kingdoms and chiefdoms, with the **Kingdom of Ndongo** and the **Kingdom of Matamba** being two of the most notable. These kingdoms developed complex systems of government, agriculture, and trade, and were often at odds with one another. The arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century marked a significant turning point in Angolan history, as the colonial powers exploited the country's natural resources and enslaved many of its inhabitants. The **transatlantic slave trade** had a profound impact on Angola, with millions of people being forcibly taken from the country and sold into slavery in the Americas.

The colonial period in Angola was marked by **exploitation** and **oppression**, with the Portuguese extracting the country's natural resources and imposing their own language and culture on the local population. However, the 20th century saw a growing movement for independence, with **nationalist** groups such as the **MPLA** and the **UNITA** emerging to challenge Portuguese rule. Angola gained independence in 1975, but the country was immediately plunged into a devastating civil war that lasted for over two decades. The war was fueled by **Cold War** rivalries, with the **Soviet Union** backing the MPLA and the **United States** supporting the UNITA.

In recent years, Angola has made significant progress in rebuilding its economy and infrastructure, with the country becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including **corruption**, **poverty**, and **inequality**. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and improving living standards, but much work remains to be done. Despite these challenges, Angola has a rich cultural heritage and a strong sense of national identity, with the country's **music**, **art**, and **literature** being highly regarded both domestically and internationally.
