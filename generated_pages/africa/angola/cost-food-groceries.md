[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Angola are generally higher compared to the regional average, mainly due to the country's reliance on imports and high transportation costs. The inflation rate of 28.2% in 2024 has also driven up prices, making it challenging for locals and expats to afford basic necessities. Eating out is not a common practice among locals, with many preferring to cook at home due to the high costs of dining out. However, for those who do eat out, there are various options available, ranging from inexpensive restaurants to fine dining establishments.

The high cost of food in Angola is also attributed to the country's limited agricultural production, which leads to a reliance on imported goods. This, combined with the high inflation rate, has resulted in a significant increase in food prices over the years. Despite these challenges, there are still affordable options available for those who are willing to cook at home and explore local markets. With a GDP per capita PPP of $10,119, many Angolans have a relatively high purchasing power, which has contributed to the growth of the middle class and an increasing demand for high-quality food products.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, there is a significant price difference between supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices ranging from 10-20% higher than those found at local markets. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, which may be difficult to find at local markets. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and staples at lower prices, making them a more affordable option for many Angolans. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and visitors can expect to haggle over prices to get the best deal.

For those looking to save money, it's recommended to shop at local markets for fresh produce and staples, and reserve supermarket shopping for imported goods or specialty items. Additionally, buying in bulk and shopping during off-peak hours can also help reduce costs. It's also worth noting that many local markets offer a wide range of traditional dishes and snacks, which can be a great way to experience the local cuisine without breaking the bank. With a little planning and flexibility, it's possible to eat well in Angola without overspending.
