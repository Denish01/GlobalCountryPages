Primary education, also known as **ensino primário**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 11 and lasts for 6 years. Secondary education, or **ensino secundário**, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for 2 years and the second cycle lasts for 3 years. Tertiary education, or **ensino superior**, includes universities and polytechnic institutions, and offers a range of undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The quality of education in Angola varies, with public schools often facing challenges such as limited resources and outdated infrastructure, while private schools tend to offer higher quality education but at a higher cost.\n\nThe public education system in Angola is free and compulsory for all children, but the quality of education can vary greatly depending on the region and the school. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a range of educational programs and are often preferred by families who can afford the tuition fees. Despite the challenges facing the education system, the Angolan government has made efforts to improve the quality of education, including investing in teacher training and infrastructure development.\n\nThe education system in Angola also faces challenges such as a shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in rural areas, and a lack of resources and infrastructure. However, the government has made efforts to address these challenges, including implementing programs to attract and retain qualified teachers and investing in the development of new schools and educational facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
