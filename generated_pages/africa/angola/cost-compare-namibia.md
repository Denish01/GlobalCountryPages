[SECTION] Overview: Angola vs Namibia [/SECTION]
Angola and Namibia are two neighboring countries in southern Africa with distinct economic profiles. Angola is a major oil producer, while Namibia has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on mining, agriculture, and tourism. The cost of living in Angola is influenced by its oil-driven economy, which has led to higher prices for housing, food, and transportation. In contrast, Namibia has a more stable economy with lower inflation, resulting in a lower cost of living. Overall, Namibia is generally cheaper than Angola, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Angola's economy has been heavily reliant on oil exports, which has led to a high cost of living in the capital city of Luanda. In contrast, Namibia's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on tourism, mining, and agriculture, which has helped to keep costs lower. Additionally, Namibia has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, transportation, and communication systems, which has also contributed to its lower cost of living.
