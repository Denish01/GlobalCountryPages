In general, the cost of utilities in Angola is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The costs are also subject to fluctuation due to the country's high inflation rate, which was 28.2% in 2024. Additionally, there is a seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season, which can lead to increased prices.\n\nThe Angolan government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the electricity grid and the development of new water treatment plants. However, the country still faces challenges in providing reliable and affordable utility services to its citizens. The high cost of utilities can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited incomes. As a result, many people rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators and solar panels, to supplement their electricity needs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Angola Telecom, Unitel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 60 Mbps | Angola Telecom, Unitel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Movicel, Unitel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Movicel, Unitel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Angola Telecom, Unitel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Angola, it is recommended to contact the local providers, such as Angola Telecom or Unitel, and provide the necessary documentation, including a passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity is a popular option in Angola, as it allows users to control their energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Angola are Angola Telecom and Unitel, which offer a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of promotional offers and discounts from providers.\n- It is also a good idea to monitor your utility usage regularly and adjust your consumption habits accordingly to avoid unexpected bills and reduce your environmental impact.",
