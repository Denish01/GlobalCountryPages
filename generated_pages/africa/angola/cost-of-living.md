[SECTION] How Expensive Is Angola? [/SECTION]
Angola is considered one of the most expensive countries in Africa, with a high cost of living, especially in the capital city of Luanda. The country's economy is largely driven by its oil industry, which has led to a significant influx of foreign workers and investors, driving up prices for accommodation, food, and other living expenses. Compared to its neighbors, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, Angola is significantly more expensive, with prices often rivaling those found in Western countries.

The high cost of living in Angola is due to a combination of factors, including the country's limited infrastructure, high demand for goods and services, and a relatively small market. Additionally, the country's import-oriented economy means that many goods are imported from abroad, which can drive up prices due to transportation and customs costs. As a result, visitors and expatriates can expect to pay premium prices for accommodation, food, and other living expenses, making Angola a challenging destination for budget-conscious travelers.
