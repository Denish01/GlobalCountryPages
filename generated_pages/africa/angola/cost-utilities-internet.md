[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Angola's utility infrastructure is still developing, and the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location. In general, the cost of utilities in Angola is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The costs are also subject to fluctuation due to the country's high inflation rate, which was 28.2% in 2024. Additionally, there is a seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season, which can lead to increased prices.

The Angolan government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the electricity grid and the development of new water treatment plants. However, the country still faces challenges in providing reliable and affordable utility services to its citizens. The high cost of utilities can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited incomes. As a result, many people rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators and solar panels, to supplement their electricity needs.
