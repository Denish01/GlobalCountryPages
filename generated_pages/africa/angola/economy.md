[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Angola has an upper-middle income economy, driven primarily by its oil and natural gas reserves. The country has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, although it still faces challenges related to poverty, inequality, and corruption. Angola's economy is classified as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing its dependence on oil exports. However, the country's development level remains relatively low, with significant disparities in income and access to basic services such as healthcare and education.

Angola's economic trajectory has been shaped by its history of conflict and colonization. The country gained independence from Portugal in 1975, but was embroiled in a civil war that lasted for nearly three decades. The war had a devastating impact on the economy, with many infrastructure and industries destroyed or neglected. Since the end of the war in 2002, Angola has made significant progress in rebuilding its economy, with oil production being the main driver of growth. However, the country's reliance on oil exports makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.

The government has recognized the need to diversify the economy and has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting non-oil sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. However, the pace of reform has been slow, and the country still faces significant challenges related to corruption, bureaucracy, and infrastructure constraints. Despite these challenges, Angola has the potential to become a major economic player in Africa, with its strategic location, abundant natural resources, and large market.
