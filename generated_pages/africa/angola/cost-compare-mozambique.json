  "content": "Mozambique is generally cheaper than Angola, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAngola GDP per Capita (PPP): $6,389\nMozambique GDP per Capita (PPP): $1,266\nAngola Inflation Rate: 17.3%\nMozambique Inflation Rate: 3.9%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Mozambique\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Angola vs Mozambique [/SECTION]\nAngola and Mozambique are two neighboring countries in southern Africa with distinct economic profiles. Angola has a more developed economy, driven by its oil and gas sector, while Mozambique's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and services. The cost of living in Angola is generally higher due to the country's limited domestic production, reliance on imports, and high demand for goods and services. In contrast, Mozambique has a more competitive market, with lower prices for many essential goods and services.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Angola's economy has been affected by the decline in oil prices, which has led to a depreciation of the local currency and higher inflation. Mozambique, on the other hand, has experienced more stable economic growth, with lower inflation rates and a more stable currency. As a result, Mozambique is generally cheaper than Angola, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower. This makes Mozambique a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a affordable lifestyle in southern Africa.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $800 | $400 | 50% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $500 | $250 | 50% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $1,800 | $900 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $15 | $8 | 46% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $300 | $200 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $3 | $2 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $2 | $1.50 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1.50 | $1 | 33% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $0.90 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $150 | $100 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $20 | $15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Angola (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $1,200 | $800 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | $2,000 | $1,400 | 30% |\n| Comfortable | $3,500 | $2,500 | 29% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Angola is cheaper for:**\n- High-end dining and entertainment options\n- Luxury goods and imported products\n- International flights and travel\n- Private education and healthcare services\n- **Mozambique is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing\n- Food and groceries\n- Transportation and fuel\n- Utilities and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMozambique offers better value for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle in southern Africa.
