[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Angola has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by cooler temperatures and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making it challenging for travel. The country can be divided into three climate zones: the coastal area, which has a milder climate, the central highlands, which have a cooler climate, and the southern region, which has a hot and dry climate. The dry season is the best time to explore the country's national parks, go on safaris, and enjoy outdoor activities.

The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travel, especially in the rural areas where roads may become impassable due to flooding. However, the wet season is also a time of great beauty, with the countryside becoming lush and green, and the waterfalls and rivers becoming full and impressive. The wet season is also the best time to see the country's wildlife, as the animals tend to congregate around the water sources. Overall, the best time to visit Angola depends on your preferences and what you want to do during your trip.

The dry season is also the peak tourist season, with many tourists flocking to the country to take advantage of the good weather and outdoor activities. The prices for accommodations and tours tend to be higher during this time, but the experience is well worth the extra cost. If you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to May or September to November, when the weather is still pleasant and the prices are lower.
