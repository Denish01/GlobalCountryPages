  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Angola can vary greatly depending on whether you choose public or private healthcare services, with public services being generally more affordable but often overcrowded and underfunded, while private services offer better quality care but at a significantly higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $76 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 32.5% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: AOA\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nAngola's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, with limited resources and long waiting times. In contrast, private healthcare services offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost, making them inaccessible to many locals. For foreigners, private healthcare services are often the preferred option, as they offer a higher standard of care and more English-speaking staff. However, it is recommended that foreigners have health insurance that covers them in Angola, as medical evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of a serious medical emergency.\n\nThe healthcare system in Angola is not universal, and many locals rely on out-of-pocket payments to access healthcare services. The government has been working to improve the public healthcare system, but progress has been slow. For foreigners, it is essential to have a good understanding of the healthcare system and to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency. This may include having health insurance that covers them in Angola, as well as knowing the location of the best hospitals and medical facilities in the area.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$200 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical services in Angola and abroad, including medical evacuation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available in pharmacies, but may be more expensive than in other countries.\n- Prescription rules are generally not well enforced, and many medications can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas.\n- The cost of medications can vary greatly depending on the brand and quality, with generic medications being significantly cheaper.\n- It is recommended to bring any prescription medications with you when traveling to Angola, as they may not be available locally.\n- Some pharmacies may not accept credit or debit cards, so it is essential to have cash on hand.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to know what to do and where to go. The emergency number in Angola is 112, and ambulance services are available in urban areas. However, ambulance services may not be readily available in rural areas, and it may be necessary to seek alternative transportation to a medical facility. The best hospitals for foreigners in Angola are generally private hospitals, such as the Clinica Girassol in Luanda, which offer a higher standard of care and more English-speaking staff. It is recommended to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of transportation to get there.\n\nIn the event of a serious medical emergency, medical evacuation to another country may be necessary. This can be a costly and complex process, and it is essential to have health insurance that covers medical evacuation. It is also recommended to research the best hospitals and medical facilities in the region, and to have a plan in place for emergency situations. By being prepared and having a good understanding of the healthcare system in Angola, foreigners can minimize their risk and ensure that they receive the best possible care in case of a medical emergency.",
