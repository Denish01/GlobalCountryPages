  "content": "The population of Angola is approximately 35.6 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that shape the country's cultural identity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 35.6 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 3.2%\nMedian Age: 16.5 years\nUrban Population: 66%\nPopulation Density: 28.5 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 61.2 years\nFertility Rate: 5.6 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nAngola has a large and growing population, with an estimated 35.6 million people living in the country. The population growth rate is approximately 3.2%, which is one of the highest in the world. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a high fertility rate and declining mortality rates. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 16.5 years, and is increasingly urbanized, with approximately 66% of the population living in urban areas. The population density is relatively low, at 28.5 people per square kilometer, due to the country's large size and the fact that much of the population is concentrated in a few urban areas.\n\nThe population of Angola is expected to continue growing rapidly in the coming years, driven by high fertility rates and declining mortality rates. This growth will likely put pressure on the country's infrastructure and resources, particularly in urban areas. However, it also presents opportunities for economic growth and development, as a large and growing population can provide a significant workforce and consumer market.\n\nAngola's population is also characterized by significant migration patterns, both within the country and internationally. Many Angolans have migrated to other countries in search of economic opportunities, particularly during the country's long civil war. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in migration to Angola from other African countries, particularly from the Democratic Republic of Congo and West Africa.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ovimbundu | 37% | Central Highlands | Largest ethnic group in Angola |\n| Kimbundu | 25% | Luanda and surrounding areas | Traditional rulers of the Kingdom of Ndongo |\n| Bakongo | 13% | North and Cabinda | Influential in the country's politics and economy |\n| Chokwe | 8% | Eastern Angola | Known for their skilled artisans and traders |\n| Nganguela | 5% | Eastern Angola | Traditional farmers and herders |\n| Kwanyama | 4% | Southern Angola | Part of the larger Ovambo people |\n| Luchazi | 3% | Eastern Angola | Known for their expertise in hunting and gathering |\n[/TABLE]\nAngola is a culturally diverse country, with over 40 ethnic groups represented.
