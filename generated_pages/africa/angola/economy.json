  "content": "[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($124 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($3,441 estimate)\nIncome Classification: Upper-Middle\nMain Industries: Oil, Diamonds, Agriculture\nCurrency: AOA\nUnemployment Rate: (approximately 20%)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 177 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nAngola has an upper-middle income economy, driven primarily by its oil and natural gas reserves. The country has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, although it still faces challenges related to poverty, inequality, and corruption. Angola's economy is classified as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing its dependence on oil exports. However, the country's development level remains relatively low, with significant disparities in income and access to basic services such as healthcare and education.\n\nAngola's economic trajectory has been shaped by its history of conflict and colonization. The country gained independence from Portugal in 1975, but was embroiled in a civil war that lasted for nearly three decades. The war had a devastating impact on the economy, with many infrastructure and industries destroyed or neglected. Since the end of the war in 2002, Angola has made significant progress in rebuilding its economy, with oil production being the main driver of growth. However, the country's reliance on oil exports makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.\n\nThe government has recognized the need to diversify the economy and has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting non-oil sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. However, the pace of reform has been slow, and the country still faces significant challenges related to corruption, bureaucracy, and infrastructure constraints. Despite these challenges, Angola has the potential to become a major economic player in Africa, with its strategic location, abundant natural resources, and large market.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Oil and Gas | 50% of GDP | Angola is the second-largest oil producer in Africa, with most of its oil being exported to China, the US, and Europe |\n| Diamonds | 10% of GDP | Angola is one of the world's largest diamond producers, with the government-owned Endiama being the main player in the industry |\n| Agriculture | 8% of GDP | Agriculture is a significant sector in Angola, with crops such as maize, cassava, and beans being major exports |\n| Manufacturing | 5% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is still relatively underdeveloped in Angola, but has potential for growth in areas such as textiles, food processing, and construction materials |\n| Services | 20% of GDP | The services sector is growing in Angola, with the government aiming to develop the tourism industry and promote the country as a hub for financial services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Crude Oil**: accounting for over 90% of Angola's export revenue\n- **Diamonds**: with the country being one of the world's largest diamond producers\n- **Coffee**: with Angola being a significant producer of coffee in Africa\n- **Sisal**: a plant fiber used to make rope and other products\n- **Iron Ore**: with the country having significant iron ore reserves\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery and Equipment**: with Angola importing significant amounts of machinery and equipment for its oil and gas industry\n- **Vehicles**: with the country having a large market for vehicles\n- **Foodstuffs**: with Angola importing significant amounts of food, particularly wheat and rice\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: with the country having a growing demand for pharmaceuticals\n- **Electronics**: with Angola importing significant amounts of electronics, particularly mobile phones and computers\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: Angola's largest trading partner, with China being the main destination for Angola's oil exports\n- Portugal: a significant trading partner, with Portugal being a major investor in Angola's economy\n- United States: a major trading partner, with the US being a significant market for Angola's oil exports\n- Brazil: a growing trading partner, with Brazil being a major investor in Angola's economy\n- South Africa: a significant trading partner, with South Africa being a major market for Angola's exports\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Angola has a relatively underdeveloped transport network, with significant investment needed in roads, railways, and ports\n- The country has significant energy reserves, with oil and gas being the main sources of energy\n- Internet and mobile penetration is growing in Angola, with the country having a relatively high level of mobile penetration\n- Angola has several major ports, including the port of Luanda and the port of Lobito, which are significant hubs for trade\n- The country has several international airports, including the Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport in Luanda, which is a major hub for air travel in southern Africa\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nAngola's economic outlook is positive, with the country expected to continue growing in the coming years.
