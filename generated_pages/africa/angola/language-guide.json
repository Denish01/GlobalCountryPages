  "content": "The official language of Angola is **Portuguese**, which is widely spoken throughout the country, and visitors will find that speaking some basic Portuguese phrases can greatly enhance their experience.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Portuguese\nWidely Spoken: Umbundu, Kimbundu, and Kikongo\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Angola is characterized by a mix of **Portuguese**, the official language, and various local languages, including **Umbundu**, **Kimbundu**, and **Kikongo**. These local languages are widely spoken in different regions of the country, with Umbundu being the most widely spoken. While Portuguese is the language of government, education, and media, many Angolans also speak one or more local languages. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of major cities like Luanda, and visitors may find that not many people speak English, especially among older generations. However, there is a growing trend of young Angolans learning English, particularly in the tourism and business sectors.\n\nRegional dialects of Portuguese are also spoken in Angola, with the Luanda dialect being the most widely understood. Minority languages, such as **Chokwe** and **Kwanyama**, are also spoken in certain regions, particularly in the north and east of the country. Visitors who speak some Portuguese will find it easier to communicate and navigate the country, but it's still possible to get by with limited language skills, especially in tourist areas.\n\nThe use of local languages is an important part of Angolan culture, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few words and phrases in the local languages will be well-received by the locals. For example, learning to greet people in the local language, such as \"kiaru\" in Kimbundu, can go a long way in building relationships and showing respect for the culture.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Olá | oh-LAH | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Kiço | kee-soh | informal |\n| Thank you | Obrigado/Obrigada | oh-bree-GAH-doo/oh-bree-GAH-dah | male/female speaker |\n| Please | Por favor | pohr fah-VOHR | polite |\n| Yes / No | Sim/Não | SEEM/NAH-oh | yes/no |\n| Excuse me | Desculpe | deh-SKOOL-peh | apology |\n| How much? | Quanto custa? | KWAHN-toh KOOS-tah | asking price |\n| Where is...? | Onde é...? | OHN-deh EH | asking for location |\n| I don't understand | Não entendo | NAH-oh ehn-TEHN-doo | not understanding |\n| Do you speak English? | Fala inglês? | FAH-lah eeng-lee-EHZ | asking if someone speaks English |\n| Help! | Socorro! | soh-KOH-roh | emergency |\n| Goodbye | Tchau | CHOW | informal |\n| Sorry | Peço desculpas | PEH-soo deh-SKOOL-pahs | apology |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Um | oom |\n| 2 | Dois | DOH-ees |\n| 3 | Três | TRAYS |\n| 4 | Quatro | KWAH-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | SEEN-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | SAY-is |\n| 7 | Sete | SEH-teh |\n| 8 | Oito | OH-ee-toh |\n| 9 | Nove | NOH-veh |\n| 10 | Dez | deh-Z |\n| 100 | Cem | SEHM |\n| 1000 | Mil | MEEL |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when interacting with older generations.\n- Use **body language** to show respect, such as using both hands when giving or receiving something.\n- Avoid **gestures** that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the index finger.\n- **Formality** is important in Angolan culture, so use formal titles and last names when addressing someone.\n- **Learn some basic Portuguese phrases** to show respect and appreciation for the culture.\n- **Smile and be patient** when communicating, as it can go a long way in building relationships.\n- **Ask for help** if you need it, and don't be afraid to ask someone to repeat themselves if you don't understand.\n- **Use visual aids** like maps or pictures to help communicate, especially if you don't speak the same language.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- **Google Translate** is a useful app for translating Portuguese to English and vice versa.\n- **Phrasebooks** can be a helpful resource for learning basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- **Language learning apps** like Duolingo can be a great way to learn some basic Portuguese before your trip.\n- **Hiring a local guide** can be a good way to get help with communication and navigation, especially if you don't speak Portuguese.\n- **Carrying a dictionary** or a phrasebook can be a useful backup in case you need to look up a word or phrase.",
