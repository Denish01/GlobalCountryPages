The GDP per capita (PPP) of $10,119 is a good indicator of the overall affordability of the country. A budget of $1,200 per month would allow for a basic lifestyle, with shared accommodation and limited expenses on entertainment and travel. A mid-range budget of $2,500 per month would provide a more comfortable lifestyle, with a one-bedroom apartment in the city center and the ability to afford some luxuries. A comfortable budget of $4,500 per month would allow for a high standard of living, with a nice two-bedroom apartment and the ability to afford regular travel and entertainment.\n\nThe cost of living in Angola is high due to the country's history of economic instability and the resulting high inflation rate of 28.2%. This has driven up the cost of basic necessities such as food, housing, and transportation. However, the country's economy is growing, and the cost of living is slowly becoming more manageable. Compared to neighboring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, Angola is more expensive, but it offers a unique cultural experience and a growing expat community.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 200 | 800 | 1,500 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 300 | 500 | 800 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 50 | 100 | 200 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 100 | 150 | 250 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 50 | 100 | 200 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 100 | 200 | 500 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 50 | 100 | 200 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 100 | 200 | 500 | |\n| **Total** | **1,200** | **2,500** | **4,500** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle in Angola would be quite basic, with a focus on necessity over luxury.
