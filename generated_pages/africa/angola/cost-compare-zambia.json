Angola has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed economy, driven by its oil and gas sector, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Zambia, on the other hand, has a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, mining, and tourism, resulting in a lower cost of living. Overall, Zambia is generally cheaper than Angola, with a cost of living that is around 20-30% lower, depending on the specific category and lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living levels. Angola's economy has been affected by fluctuations in global oil prices, which has led to periods of high inflation and economic instability. Zambia, on the other hand, has a more stable economy, with a growing tourism sector and a diverse range of industries. This stability has contributed to a lower cost of living in Zambia, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 60% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 300 | 67% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 1,000 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 50% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 200 | 50% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 67% more |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 15 | 33% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.5 | 1 | 50% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 0.8 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 50% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 67% more |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 33% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Angola (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 29% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,500 | 37% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Angola is cheaper for:**\n- High-end dining and entertainment options\n- Luxury goods and services\n- International flights and travel\n- Private education and healthcare\n- **Zambia is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation and rent\n- Local transportation and fuel\n- Groceries and everyday essentials\n- Outdoor activities and tourism\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Angola and Zambia varies significantly, depending on the specific category and lifestyle.
