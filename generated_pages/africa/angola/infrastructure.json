  "content": "The infrastructure in Angola is still developing, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications, but there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 40% of population\nInternet Penetration: 13%\nRoad Network: 73,000 km, with many roads in poor condition\nRail Network: 2,761 km\nMajor Airports: 11\nMajor Ports: 3\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nAngola's infrastructure development has been hindered by years of civil war and underinvestment, but in recent years, the government has made significant efforts to improve the country's infrastructure. The **National Development Plan** has outlined major investments in roads, railways, and energy generation, with a focus on improving access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Despite these efforts, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic infrastructure. The capital city, Luanda, has seen significant investment in recent years, with new roads, buildings, and amenities being constructed, but other parts of the country remain underdeveloped.\n\nThe government has also made efforts to attract foreign investment to help develop the country's infrastructure, with a number of major projects currently underway, including the construction of new roads, railways, and energy generation facilities. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled labor and a complex bureaucracy, which can make it difficult to get projects off the ground. Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to developing the country's infrastructure, and there are signs that progress is being made.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing Angola's infrastructure development is the country's vast size and geographical diversity. With a territory of over 1.2 million square kilometers, Angola is a large and sprawling country, and developing infrastructure that covers the entire country is a significant challenge. However, the government is working to address this challenge, with a number of major projects currently underway to improve the country's transportation network and increase access to basic services.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 73,000 km | Poor | Many roads are in disrepair, particularly in rural areas |\n| Railways | 2,761 km | Moderate | Rail network is limited, but there are plans to expand |\n| Airports | 11 international, 30 domestic | Good | Major airports are well-maintained, but smaller airports are often in poor condition |\n| Ports | 3 major | Good | Ports are well-maintained and play a critical role in the country's economy |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Angola's power generation is primarily based on **hydroelectric power**, with a number of major dams located throughout the country.\n- The country's energy sector is still developing, and there are frequent **power outages**, particularly in rural areas.\n- The government has made efforts to increase the use of **renewable energy**, including solar and wind power, but these sources still account for a relatively small percentage of the country's overall energy generation.\n- The country's **energy transmission and distribution network** is still underdeveloped, and there are significant losses during transmission and distribution.\n- There are plans to increase the country's power generation capacity, including the construction of new hydroelectric dams and other energy generation facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **safe drinking water** is still a challenge in many parts of the country, particularly in rural areas.\n- The country's **sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many communities lacking access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- The government has made efforts to improve access to water and sanitation, including the construction of new water treatment facilities and sanitation systems.\n- However, there is still a significant gap in access to these services, particularly in rural areas.\n- The country is also working to improve the **management of water resources**, including the development of new water storage facilities and irrigation systems.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile phone coverage** is widespread in Angola, with a number of major operators providing services throughout the country.\n- The country's **fiber optic network** is still underdeveloped, but there are plans to expand the network in the coming years.\n- **4G services** are available in major cities, but coverage is still limited in rural areas.\n- The government has made efforts to improve the country's **telecommunications infrastructure**, including the construction of new fiber optic cables and the expansion of mobile phone coverage.\n- The country's **postal services** are still underdeveloped, but there are plans to improve the services in the coming years.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a number of major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of new roads, railways, and energy generation facilities.\n- The **Angola LNG project** is a major development project that aims to increase the country's liquefied natural gas production.\n- The government has also launched a number of initiatives to improve access to basic services, including the construction of new water treatment facilities and sanitation systems.\n- The country is also working to develop its **mining sector**, with a number of major mining projects currently underway.\n- The government has also made efforts to improve the country's **transportation network**, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the country's railways.",
