[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Angola has been improving in recent years, with the average internet speed increasing to 5 Mbps download, although this can be slower in rural areas. The urban vs rural divide is significant, with cities like Luanda and Benguela having more reliable and faster internet connections, while rural areas often struggle with poor connectivity and slow speeds. The reliability of the internet can also be a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.

The Angolan government has been investing in the development of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, including the expansion of fiber-optic networks and the introduction of new technologies like 4G. However, despite these efforts, the internet in Angola remains relatively expensive and inaccessible to many people, particularly in rural areas. The cost of internet services, including SIM cards and data plans, can be prohibitively expensive for many Angolans, and the lack of infrastructure and connectivity in rural areas can make it difficult for people to access online services and information.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Angola is relatively straightforward, with several mobile providers offering tourist-friendly plans and data packages. The main carriers, Unitel, Movicel, and Angola Telecom, all offer SIM cards that can be purchased at their stores or at many retail outlets and markets. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide some identification, such as a passport, and register your details with the provider. The cost of a SIM card can vary, but you can expect to pay around 20 USD for a tourist SIM with a data package.

The recommended carriers for tourists are Unitel and Movicel, which both offer a range of data plans and packages that can be tailored to your needs. Unitel's tourist plan, for example, includes 1 GB of data, 100 minutes of calls, and 100 SMS, all for around 10 USD per day. Movicel's plan includes 2 GB of data, 200 minutes of calls, and 200 SMS, all for around 20 USD per week.
