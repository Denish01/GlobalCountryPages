# The Truth About Angola - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Angola, a **sovereign** country located in southern Africa, has a rich and complex history. The area that is now Angola was first inhabited by various indigenous groups, including the **Khoisan** and **Bantu** peoples. In 1575, the Portuguese established a settlement in Luanda, which became the capital of the colony. Angola was a Portuguese colony from 1575 to 1975, with the Portuguese exploiting the country's natural resources, including **slaves**, **cotton**, and **minerals**. On November 11, 1975, Angola gained its independence from Portugal, with Agostinho Neto as its first president.

The early years of independence were marked by a **civil war** between the **MPLA** (People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola), the **UNITA** (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), and the **FNLA** (National Front for the Liberation of Angola). The civil war lasted from 1975 to 2002, with the MPLA eventually emerging as the dominant force. During this time, Angola received support from the **Soviet Union** and **Cuba**, while the United States and **South Africa** supported the UNITA.

In 1992, Angola held its first **multiparty elections**, with the MPLA winning a majority of seats in the National Assembly. However, the elections were marred by violence and allegations of **fraud**. In 2002, the civil war ended with the death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, and the MPLA has since maintained control of the government.

Today, Angola is a **presidential republic**, with a president serving as both head of state and head of government. The country has a **unicameral** legislature, with a National Assembly composed of 220 members. Angola is a member of the **African Union**, the **Southern African Development Community**, and the **Portuguese-speaking Countries Community**.
