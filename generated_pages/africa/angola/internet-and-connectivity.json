  "content": "The internet in Angola is characterized by moderate speeds and coverage, with a growing number of options for getting a SIM card and accessing WiFi, although the quality and reliability can vary greatly between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Unitel, Movicel, Angola Telecom\nSIM Card Cost: 20 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Angola has been improving in recent years, with the average internet speed increasing to 5 Mbps download, although this can be slower in rural areas. The urban vs rural divide is significant, with cities like Luanda and Benguela having more reliable and faster internet connections, while rural areas often struggle with poor connectivity and slow speeds. The reliability of the internet can also be a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.\n\nThe Angolan government has been investing in the development of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, including the expansion of fiber-optic networks and the introduction of new technologies like 4G. However, despite these efforts, the internet in Angola remains relatively expensive and inaccessible to many people, particularly in rural areas. The cost of internet services, including SIM cards and data plans, can be prohibitively expensive for many Angolans, and the lack of infrastructure and connectivity in rural areas can make it difficult for people to access online services and information.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Angola is relatively straightforward, with several mobile providers offering tourist-friendly plans and data packages. The main carriers, Unitel, Movicel, and Angola Telecom, all offer SIM cards that can be purchased at their stores or at many retail outlets and markets. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide some identification, such as a passport, and register your details with the provider. The cost of a SIM card can vary, but you can expect to pay around 20 USD for a tourist SIM with a data package.\n\nThe recommended carriers for tourists are Unitel and Movicel, which both offer a range of data plans and packages that can be tailored to your needs. Unitel's tourist plan, for example, includes 1 GB of data, 100 minutes of calls, and 100 SMS, all for around 10 USD per day. Movicel's plan includes 2 GB of data, 200 minutes of calls, and 200 SMS, all for around 20 USD per week.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Unitel | Daily Plan | 1 GB | 10 | Includes 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS |\n| Movicel | Weekly Plan | 2 GB | 20 | Includes 200 minutes of calls and 200 SMS |\n| Angola Telecom | Monthly Plan | 5 GB | 50 | Includes 500 minutes of calls and 500 SMS |\n| Unitel | Monthly Plan | 10 GB | 100 | Includes 1000 minutes of calls and 1000 SMS |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many hotels and resorts offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not very common in Angola, although some cafes and restaurants in larger cities may offer WiFi\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more popular in Luanda and other major cities, and often offer fast and reliable WiFi\n- Public WiFi is limited, although some cities and towns may have public WiFi hotspots in areas like parks and plazas\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer WiFi, although the quality can vary\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Luanda Cowork and Angola Cowork offer fast and reliable WiFi, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and printers\n- Reliable cafe chains like Cafe Continental and Cafe Luanda offer WiFi, although the quality can vary\n- Backup internet options like portable WiFi hotspots and mobile data plans can be useful in case of outages or disruptions\n- VPNs can be useful for remote workers who need to access sensitive information or communicate with colleagues and clients securely\n- Many hotels and resorts also offer coworking spaces and meeting rooms, which can be useful for remote workers who need a quiet and productive space\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major concern in Angola, although some websites and online services may be blocked or restricted\n- Blocked sites can include those that are deemed to be a threat to national security or that promote hate speech or violence\n- VPNs can be useful for accessing blocked websites and online services, although they may not always work\n- Roaming alternatives like portable WiFi hotspots and local SIM cards can be more cost-effective and convenient than roaming with your home carrier\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Angola, although some carriers may offer eSIM plans and services\n- It's a good idea to research and compare different internet service providers and plans before choosing one, to ensure that you get the best value and service for your needs.",
