Angola has a relatively high GDP per capita due to its significant oil reserves, while DR Congo has a much lower GDP per capita due to its struggling economy. The cost of living in Angola is generally higher than in DR Congo, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being significantly higher in Luanda, the capital city of Angola. The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living, with Angola's oil-driven economy leading to higher prices for goods and services.\n\nThe overall cost of living in Angola is around 20-30% higher than in DR Congo, making DR Congo a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees. However, the cost of living in Angola can vary greatly depending on the lifestyle and location, with Luanda being one of the most expensive cities in Africa. In contrast, DR Congo offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. Despite the lower cost of living, DR Congo still faces significant economic challenges, including high inflation and a lack of infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | DR Congo (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $1,200 | $400 | 66% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $800 | $250 | 68% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $2,500 | $800 | 68% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | DR Congo (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $15 | $5 | 66% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $150 | $80 | 46% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | $3 | $2 | 33% more expensive |\n| Coffee | $2 | $1 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | DR Congo (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $10 | 50% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1.50 | $0.50 | 66% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $0.80 | 33% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | DR Congo (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $150 | $80 | 46% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $30 | 40% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | $20 | $10 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Angola (USD) | DR Congo (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $800 | $500 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,200 | $800 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $1,200 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Angola is cheaper for:**\n- - High-end shopping and dining options\n- - Better infrastructure and amenities\n- - Higher quality healthcare services\n- - More entertainment options\n- **DR Congo is cheaper for:**\n- - Accommodation and housing options\n- - Food and groceries\n- - Transportation and fuel\n- - Utilities and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nThe choice between Angola and DR Congo ultimately depends on the individual's lifestyle and priorities.
