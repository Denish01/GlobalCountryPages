You can fly into Luanda from cities like Lisbon, Paris, and Johannesburg, among others. Overland entry points are also available, particularly from neighboring countries like Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, although traveling by land can be challenging due to poor road conditions and border formalities.\n\nIf you plan to enter Angola by land, it is essential to research the current border crossing requirements and road conditions, as these can change frequently. Additionally, consider the time of year and weather conditions, as some roads may become impassable during the rainy season. It is also recommended to join a guided tour or use a reputable transportation service when traveling overland to ensure a smooth and safe journey.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nAngola has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities like Luanda, Benguela, and Huambo. The main domestic airlines are TAAG Angola Airlines and Fly Angola, which offer regular flights to various destinations within the country. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs can range from $100 to $500 or more, depending on the route and class of service. It is also a good idea to check with the airlines for any travel restrictions or requirements, such as proof of onward travel or a return ticket.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nAngola's rail network is limited, with only a few lines operating, including the Benguela Railway, which connects the port city of Benguela to the eastern part of the country. The rail network is primarily used for freight transportation, and passenger services are limited. There are no high-speed train options available, and the booking process can be challenging due to limited online resources and infrastructure. However, taking the train can be a unique and scenic way to see the country, and it is worth considering for those who have the time and flexibility.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nSeveral bus companies operate in Angola, offering intercity services between major towns and cities. The quality of the buses and coaches can vary, ranging from modern and comfortable to older and more basic vehicles.

However, taking the bus can be a good way to see the countryside and meet locals, and it is often the most affordable option for travelers on a budget.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Luanda, Benguela | $0.50-$1.00 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10/km | Metered taxis are scarce, negotiate fare before departure |\n| Ride-Hailing | Luanda | $5-$10 | Local alternatives like Taxify and Kubinga |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Some cities | $1-$2 | Limited availability and safety concerns |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Angola, you will need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a local license or international driving permit.\n- Road conditions in Angola are generally poor, with many roads being unpaved or in disrepair, especially outside of major cities.\n- Fuel costs can be high, and availability can be limited in some areas, so it is essential to plan your route and fill up when possible.\n- Car rental options are available in major cities, but prices can be steep, and the quality of the vehicles may vary.\n- When driving in Angola, be aware of potential hazards like potholes, pedestrians, and animals on the road, as well as the risk of carjacking or theft.\n- It is also a good idea to hire a driver or join a guided tour, especially if you are not familiar with the local roads and customs.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Always negotiate the fare before departing when using taxis or ride-hailing services.\n- Be cautious of scams, such as drivers demanding extra payment or taking you to unnecessary destinations.\n- Download local transportation apps, such as Taxify or Kubinga, to book rides and track your journey.\n- Keep your valuables secure and be mindful of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas or at night.\n- Consider hiring a reputable driver or joining a guided tour to ensure a safe and smooth journey.\n- Learn some basic Portuguese phrases, such as \"onde fica...\" (where is...) or \"quanto custa...\" (how much does it cost...), to help you navigate and communicate with locals.\n- Be prepared for delays and flexibility when traveling in Angola, as transportation options can be limited and unpredictable.",
