[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Angola has a large and growing population, with an estimated 35.6 million people living in the country. The population growth rate is approximately 3.2%, which is one of the highest in the world. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a high fertility rate and declining mortality rates. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 16.5 years, and is increasingly urbanized, with approximately 66% of the population living in urban areas. The population density is relatively low, at 28.5 people per square kilometer, due to the country's large size and the fact that much of the population is concentrated in a few urban areas.

The population of Angola is expected to continue growing rapidly in the coming years, driven by high fertility rates and declining mortality rates. This growth will likely put pressure on the country's infrastructure and resources, particularly in urban areas. However, it also presents opportunities for economic growth and development, as a large and growing population can provide a significant workforce and consumer market.

Angola's population is also characterized by significant migration patterns, both within the country and internationally. Many Angolans have migrated to other countries in search of economic opportunities, particularly during the country's long civil war. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in migration to Angola from other African countries, particularly from the Democratic Republic of Congo and West Africa.
