[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Angola is characterized by a mix of **Portuguese**, the official language, and various local languages, including **Umbundu**, **Kimbundu**, and **Kikongo**. These local languages are widely spoken in different regions of the country, with Umbundu being the most widely spoken. While Portuguese is the language of government, education, and media, many Angolans also speak one or more local languages. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of major cities like Luanda, and visitors may find that not many people speak English, especially among older generations. However, there is a growing trend of young Angolans learning English, particularly in the tourism and business sectors.

Regional dialects of Portuguese are also spoken in Angola, with the Luanda dialect being the most widely understood. Minority languages, such as **Chokwe** and **Kwanyama**, are also spoken in certain regions, particularly in the north and east of the country. Visitors who speak some Portuguese will find it easier to communicate and navigate the country, but it's still possible to get by with limited language skills, especially in tourist areas.

The use of local languages is an important part of Angolan culture, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few words and phrases in the local languages will be well-received by the locals. For example, learning to greet people in the local language, such as "kiaru" in Kimbundu, can go a long way in building relationships and showing respect for the culture.
