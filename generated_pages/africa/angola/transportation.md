[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Angola has several international airports, with the main one being Quatro de Fevereiro Airport (LAD) in the capital city Luanda, which receives direct flights from major hubs in Europe, Africa, and South America. You can fly into Luanda from cities like Lisbon, Paris, and Johannesburg, among others. Overland entry points are also available, particularly from neighboring countries like Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, although traveling by land can be challenging due to poor road conditions and border formalities.

If you plan to enter Angola by land, it is essential to research the current border crossing requirements and road conditions, as these can change frequently. Additionally, consider the time of year and weather conditions, as some roads may become impassable during the rainy season. It is also recommended to join a guided tour or use a reputable transportation service when traveling overland to ensure a smooth and safe journey.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Angola has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities like Luanda, Benguela, and Huambo. The main domestic airlines are TAAG Angola Airlines and Fly Angola, which offer regular flights to various destinations within the country. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs can range from $100 to $500 or more, depending on the route and class of service. It is also a good idea to check with the airlines for any travel restrictions or requirements, such as proof of onward travel or a return ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Angola's rail network is limited, with only a few lines operating, including the Benguela Railway, which connects the port city of Benguela to the eastern part of the country. The rail network is primarily used for freight transportation, and passenger services are limited. There are no high-speed train options available, and the booking process can be challenging due to limited online resources and infrastructure. However, taking the train can be a unique and scenic way to see the country, and it is worth considering for those who have the time and flexibility.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Several bus companies operate in Angola, offering intercity services between major towns and cities. The quality of the buses and coaches can vary, ranging from modern and comfortable to older and more basic vehicles. Routes and schedules are often limited, and costs can be relatively high, especially for longer journeys. However, taking the bus can be a good way to see the countryside and meet locals, and it is often the most affordable option for travelers on a budget.
