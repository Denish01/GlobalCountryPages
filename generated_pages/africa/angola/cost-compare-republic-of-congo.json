Angola has a more developed economy, driven by its oil industry, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, the Republic of Congo has a more diversified economy, with a stronger focus on agriculture and manufacturing.

The difference in cost of living between the two countries can be attributed to various factors, including the cost of housing, food, transportation, and utilities.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Angola's economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by its oil industry, which has led to an increase in the cost of living.
