[SECTION] Overview: Angola vs Zambia [/SECTION]
Angola and Zambia are two neighboring countries in southern Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living levels. Angola has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed economy, driven by its oil and gas sector, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Zambia, on the other hand, has a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, mining, and tourism, resulting in a lower cost of living. Overall, Zambia is generally cheaper than Angola, with a cost of living that is around 20-30% lower, depending on the specific category and lifestyle.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living levels. Angola's economy has been affected by fluctuations in global oil prices, which has led to periods of high inflation and economic instability. Zambia, on the other hand, has a more stable economy, with a growing tourism sector and a diverse range of industries. This stability has contributed to a lower cost of living in Zambia, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.
