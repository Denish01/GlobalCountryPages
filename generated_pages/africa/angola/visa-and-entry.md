# Angola Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Angola before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Angola has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. Currently, only a few countries have visa-free access to Angola, including Portugal, Mozambique, and a few other African nations. Citizens from other countries can obtain a visa on arrival or through the Angolan embassy or consulate in their home country.

The Angolan government has been working to improve its visa system, introducing an electronic visa (eVisa) system for citizens from certain countries. This has made it easier for tourists and business travelers to obtain a visa and visit the country. However, the requirements and regulations can still be complex, and it's essential to check with the official authorities for the latest information.
