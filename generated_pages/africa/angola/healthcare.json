  "content": "Healthcare in Angola is a mixed system with both public and private providers, offering a range of services, but with varying quality and access, especially between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Angola is a mixed model, combining public and private providers to deliver healthcare services to its population of over 36 million people. The public sector is the main provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality services, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the majority of the population. In urban areas, such as Luanda, there are more healthcare options available, including private hospitals and clinics, while in rural areas, access to healthcare services is often limited.\n\nThe quality of care in Angola varies significantly depending on the provider and location. Public hospitals often struggle with limited resources, outdated equipment, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, resulting in a lower quality of care. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer higher-quality services, with more modern equipment and better-trained staff. However, these services are often expensive and may not be accessible to the majority of the population.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Angolan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new infrastructure and implementing programs to increase access to healthcare services. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital Josina Machel | Luanda | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Girassol | Luanda | Private | Cardiology, oncology, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Hospital Municipal de Luanda | Luanda | Public | Emergency medicine, pediatrics, gynecology | Limited |\n| Clinica Sagrada Esperanca | Luanda | Private | General medicine, surgery, dentistry | Yes |\n| Hospital do Huambo | Huambo | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Medimar | Benguela | Private | Cardiology, oncology, orthopedics | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for expats and foreigners, as it provides access to higher-quality private healthcare services.\n- Local insurance options are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** plans often include coverage for emergency medical evacuations, which may be necessary due to the limited medical facilities in Angola.\n- The cost of health insurance in Angola can be high, especially for comprehensive plans that include coverage for specialized treatments and evacuations.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n- It is essential to research and compare different insurance options to find the best plan for your needs and budget.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are available in **pharmacies** and **clinics**, but the selection may be limited, especially in rural areas.\n- **Prescriptions** are often required for medications, and it is essential to keep a copy of your prescription with you when traveling.\n- **Common brands** of medications may not be available in Angola, and generic alternatives may be the only option.\n- The **cost** of medications can be high, especially for imported brands.\n- It is recommended to bring a supply of essential medications with you when traveling to Angola, as they may not be available locally.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever** vaccination is required for travel to Angola, and it is essential to ensure that your vaccination is up to date.\n- **Malaria** is a significant health risk in Angola, and it is recommended to take prophylactic medication and use insecticide-treated bed nets.\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are also recommended, as these diseases are prevalent in Angola.\n- **Rabies** is a risk, especially in rural areas, and it is essential to avoid contact with animals that may be infected.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and it is recommended to drink bottled or filtered water to avoid waterborne diseases.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and it is essential to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and raw vegetables.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Angola is not a popular destination for medical tourism**, due to the limited medical facilities and infrastructure.\n- However, some private hospitals and clinics in Luanda may offer specialized treatments, such as **cardiology** and **oncology**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are available, but it is essential to research and verify the credentials of any hospital or clinic before seeking treatment.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for certain treatments, but it is essential to weigh the risks and benefits of seeking medical care in Angola.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, it is essential to call the emergency number, 112, or seek immediate attention at a hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is a concern, and it may be necessary to use a private taxi or transportation service to get to a hospital.\n- **Nearest hospitals** should be identified in advance, and it is essential to have a plan in place in case of an emergency.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, and it is essential to keep all medical records and receipts to facilitate the claims process.\n- It is recommended to have a **contact person** or **emergency contact** who can assist in case of an emergency.",
