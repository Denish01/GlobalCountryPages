Angola is a major oil producer, while Namibia has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on mining, agriculture, and tourism. The cost of living in Angola is influenced by its oil-driven economy, which has led to higher prices for housing, food, and transportation. In contrast, Namibia has a more stable economy with lower inflation, resulting in a lower cost of living. Overall, Namibia is generally cheaper than Angola, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Angola's economy has been heavily reliant on oil exports, which has led to a high cost of living in the capital city of Luanda. In contrast, Namibia's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on tourism, mining, and agriculture, which has helped to keep costs lower. Additionally, Namibia has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, transportation, and communication systems, which has also contributed to its lower cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Namibia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 800 | 33% cheaper in Namibia |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 800 | 500 | 38% cheaper in Namibia |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% cheaper in Namibia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Namibia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 350 | 30% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 40% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 33% cheaper in Namibia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Namibia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 100 | 50 | 50% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1 | 50% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 0.90 | 25% cheaper in Namibia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Angola (USD) | Namibia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper in Namibia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Angola (USD) | Namibia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% cheaper in Namibia |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,800 | 30% cheaper in Namibia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Angola is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end dining and entertainment\n  - Luxury accommodations\n  - International flights\n  - Business and financial services\n- **Namibia is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing\n  - Food and groceries\n  - Transportation and fuel\n  - Utilities and internet\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Namibia is generally the better value, with a lower cost of living and a more stable economy.
