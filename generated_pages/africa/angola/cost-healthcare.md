[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Angola's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, with limited resources and long waiting times. In contrast, private healthcare services offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost, making them inaccessible to many locals. For foreigners, private healthcare services are often the preferred option, as they offer a higher standard of care and more English-speaking staff. However, it is recommended that foreigners have health insurance that covers them in Angola, as medical evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of a serious medical emergency.

The healthcare system in Angola is not universal, and many locals rely on out-of-pocket payments to access healthcare services. The government has been working to improve the public healthcare system, but progress has been slow. For foreigners, it is essential to have a good understanding of the healthcare system and to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency. This may include having health insurance that covers them in Angola, as well as knowing the location of the best hospitals and medical facilities in the area.
