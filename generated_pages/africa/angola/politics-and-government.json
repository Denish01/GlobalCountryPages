The **Executive** branch is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the **Prime Minister**, who is the head of government, and other ministers. The **Legislative** branch is composed of the **National Assembly**, a unicameral body with 220 seats, where members are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **Judicial** branch is independent and composed of the **Supreme Court** and lower courts.\n\nThe **Separation of Powers** is enshrined in the **Constitution**, which ensures that each branch has distinct responsibilities and checks on the others. However, the **President** has significant influence over the **Legislative** and **Judicial** branches, which can limit their independence. Angola has a **unitary** system, with a strong central government, but there are also **decentralized** elements, with provinces and municipalities having some autonomy.\n\nThe **Constitution** also provides for **political pluralism**, with multiple parties allowed to participate in the political process. However, the **ruling party**, the **MPLA**, has dominated politics since independence in 1975. The **opposition parties** have struggled to gain significant traction, and the political landscape is often characterized by **tensions** between the **ruling party** and the **opposition**.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President João Lourenço | Head of State and Government |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Prime Minister | Head of Government |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker of the National Assembly | Legislative authority |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Judicial authority |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MPLA | Center-left | President João Lourenço | 150 | Ruling party since 1975 |\n| UNITA | Center-right | Adalberto Costa Júnior | 51 | Main opposition party |\n| CASA-CE | Center | Miguel Pires | 16 | Coalition of opposition parties |\n| PRS | Left-wing | Benedito Daniel | 2 | Opposition party |\n| FNLA | Right-wing | Lucas Ngonda | 1 | Opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The **electoral system** is based on **proportional representation**, with voters electing members to the **National Assembly**.\n- **Presidential elections** are held every five years, with the **President** serving as both **Head of State** and **Head of Government**.\n- The last **general election** was held in 2022, with the **MPLA** winning a majority of seats in the **National Assembly**.\n- The next **general election** is scheduled for 2027, with **voter participation** expected to be high, given the country's history of **electoral engagement**.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current **political climate** is characterized by **tensions** between the **ruling party** and the **opposition**, with **protests** and **demonstrations** occurring regularly.\n- **Corruption** is a significant **challenge**, with Angola ranked low in the **Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index**.\n- The **economy** is heavily dependent on **oil exports**, which has made the country vulnerable to **fluctuations** in global oil prices.\n- **Regional dynamics** are also a **challenge**, with Angola's neighbors, including the **Democratic Republic of Congo** and **Namibia**, having their own **security concerns**.\n- **Freedom indices** show that Angola has **limited freedom of speech** and **assembly**, with the **government** often **restricting** these rights.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Angola is a member of the **United Nations**, the **African Union**, and the **Southern African Development Community**.\n- The country has **strong relations** with **Portugal**, its former colonial power, and **China**, which is a significant **trading partner**.\n- Angola has also **strengthened ties** with **Brazil** and **Russia**, with which it shares **cultural** and **economic** interests.\n- The country has **challenging relations** with its neighbors, particularly the **Democratic Republic of Congo**, with which it has **border disputes**.\n- Angola has **participated** in **regional peacekeeping missions**, including in the **Democratic Republic of Congo** and **Mozambique**.",
