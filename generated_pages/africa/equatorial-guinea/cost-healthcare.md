[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Equatorial Guinea is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering medical services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality services, but at a higher cost. Locals often rely on traditional medicine and public healthcare services, while foreigners and affluent locals tend to opt for private healthcare services. It is recommended to have health insurance to cover medical expenses, especially for foreigners, as the cost of healthcare can be high and the quality of public healthcare services can be variable.

The healthcare system in Equatorial Guinea is not well-developed, and medical facilities and equipment are often in short supply. The country has a high burden of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, which can put a strain on the healthcare system. Additionally, the country has a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, which can affect the quality of care. Despite these challenges, there are some well-equipped private hospitals and clinics in the major cities, such as Malabo and Bata, which offer high-quality medical services.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112 or seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital. Ambulance services are limited, and it may be necessary to rely on private transportation to reach a medical facility. The best hospitals for foreigners are typically private hospitals, such as the Malabo General Hospital or the Bata Regional Hospital, which offer high-quality medical services and have English-speaking staff. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuations, as the quality of medical care in Equatorial Guinea can be variable and may not always meet international standards.

In addition to having a plan in place for emergency medical evacuations, it is also important to take precautions to prevent illnesses and injuries. This can include taking **malaria prophylaxis**, practicing good hygiene, and avoiding risky behaviors. It is also recommended to have a **first aid kit** on hand, which should include basic medical supplies, such as bandages, antiseptic wipes, and painkillers. By taking these precautions and having a plan in place for emergency medical situations, foreigners can help to ensure their safety and well-being while in Equatorial Guinea.
