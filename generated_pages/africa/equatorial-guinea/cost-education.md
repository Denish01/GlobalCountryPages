[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Equatorial Guinea is primarily based on the Spanish and French systems, with Spanish being the predominant language of instruction. The country has a 6-4-2 education system, where students attend primary school for 6 years, followed by 4 years of secondary school, and then 2-3 years of higher education. Public education is generally free or subsidized, but the quality can vary significantly depending on the location and availability of resources. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of Malabo, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.

The education system in Equatorial Guinea faces several challenges, including a lack of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, the country has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly at the primary level. However, there is still a significant gap in the quality of education between public and private schools, and between urban and rural areas. Expatriates and international students often opt for private or international schools, which offer a higher quality of education and a more familiar curriculum.
