        <h2>Visa Policy Overview</h2>
        <p>Equatorial Guinea has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. Only a few countries, such as Cameroon and Gabon, are exempt from visa requirements due to their membership in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). Citizens of other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and European Union member states, must obtain a visa prior to arrival. The country's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate international travel and trade with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.</p>
        <p>The visa application process in Equatorial Guinea can be complex and time-consuming, requiring applicants to submit a range of documents and wait for approval from the relevant authorities. In general, visa applicants must demonstrate that they have a legitimate reason for traveling to Equatorial Guinea, such as tourism, business, or education, and that they have sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay. The country's visa policy is subject to change, and applicants should always check with the official embassy or consulate of Equatorial Guinea for the latest information and requirements.</p>

        <h2>Entry Points & Procedures</h2>
        <p>The main entry points for Equatorial Guinea are Malabo International Airport and Bata Airport. Upon arrival, visitors must present their visa, passport, and other required documents to the immigration authorities. Visitors must also complete a declaration form, which will be provided by the airline or at the airport. The immigration authorities may ask questions about the purpose of your visit, your travel arrangements, and your accommodation. Visitors must also declare any goods they are bringing with them, including gifts and souvenirs. The entry process can be slow and bureaucratic, and visitors should be prepared to wait in line and answer questions from the immigration authorities.</p>
        <p>Equatorial Guinea also has several land borders, including borders with Cameroon and Gabon. Visitors who enter the country by land must present their visa, passport, and other required documents to the immigration authorities at the border crossing. The entry process at land borders can be more complex and time-consuming than at airports, and visitors should be prepared to wait in line and answer questions from the immigration authorities.</p>
        <h2>Common Mistakes To Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Not applying for a visa in advance, or applying for the wrong type of visa</li>
