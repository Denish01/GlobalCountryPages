The cost of food is driven up by factors such as transportation costs, taxes, and the limited competition in the market. Eating out is not a common practice in Equatorial Guinea, with most people preferring to cook at home due to the high cost of restaurant meals. However, in urban areas like Malabo, there is a growing trend of eating out, particularly among the expat community and the wealthy locals.\n\nThe high cost of food in Equatorial Guinea is also reflected in the limited availability of certain products, particularly fresh produce. The country's **tropical climate** and **poor infrastructure** make it difficult to transport and store perishable goods, resulting in a limited selection of fresh fruits and vegetables. As a result, many people rely on **canned goods** and **imported products**, which are often more expensive. Despite these challenges, the government has been working to improve the country's **agricultural sector**, with initiatives aimed at increasing local production and reducing reliance on imports.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 1,375 XAF | Imported from Europe |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | 825 XAF | Local production |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 1,100 XAF | Local production |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 660 XAF | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 3,300 XAF | Imported from Brazil |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 5,500 XAF | Imported from Europe |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 2,750 XAF | Imported from South Africa |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 825 XAF | Local production |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 550 XAF | Local production |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 440 XAF | Local production |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 4,400 XAF | Local production |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 550 XAF | Local production |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | Traditional dishes like **pepesup** and **calulu** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | One person, **African cuisine** |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | 3 courses, **international cuisine** |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | Upscale, **European cuisine** |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | **Equatoguinean beer** |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | **European beer** |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$4 | **European-style coffee** |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | **International brands** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Equatorial Guinea can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market.
