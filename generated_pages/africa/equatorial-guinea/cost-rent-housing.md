[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Equatorial Guinea is relatively small and expensive, particularly in the capital city of Malabo. The country's oil-driven economy has led to a high demand for housing, especially from expatriates and foreigners working in the oil and gas industry. As a result, rental prices are relatively high compared to other countries in the region. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and it is essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Cameroon and Gabon, Equatorial Guinea's housing costs are significantly higher, reflecting the country's unique economic situation.

The housing market in Equatorial Guinea is also characterized by a shortage of quality housing, particularly in the city center. Many apartments and houses are old and in need of renovation, which can drive up prices. Additionally, the country's infrastructure is still developing, and amenities such as electricity, water, and internet may not be as reliable as in other countries. Despite these challenges, Equatorial Guinea's housing market offers a unique opportunity for investors and renters to experience the country's vibrant culture and stunning natural beauty.
