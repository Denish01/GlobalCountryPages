[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Equatorial Guinea's population is relatively small compared to other countries in Africa, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The country's population growth rate is approximately 2.5%, which is higher than the global average. The population is predominantly urban, with about 73% of the population living in cities, mainly in the capital city of Malabo and the port city of Bata. The country's urbanization trend is driven by economic opportunities, access to education, and healthcare. Migration patterns in Equatorial Guinea are mainly internal, with people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better living conditions. However, there are also some international migration flows, particularly to neighboring countries such as Cameroon and Gabon.

The population of Equatorial Guinea is also characterized by a high fertility rate, with an average of 4.5 children per woman. This has contributed to the country's high population growth rate and has put pressure on the country's resources, including healthcare and education. The government has implemented policies to reduce the fertility rate and promote family planning, but more needs to be done to address the challenges posed by the country's rapid population growth.

Equatorial Guinea's population is also affected by the country's economic situation. The country has significant oil reserves, which have driven economic growth and improved living standards. However, the economy is also vulnerable to fluctuations in the global oil market, which can have a negative impact on the population's well-being.
