The president is directly elected by popular vote for a seven-year term, with no term limits. The separation of powers is not clearly defined, and the executive branch dominates the legislative and judicial branches. The country has a unitary system, with a centralized government and limited autonomy for local authorities. The ruling party, the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE), has maintained a tight grip on power since its founding in 1987.\n\nThe political system in Equatorial Guinea is also marked by a lack of transparency and accountability, with widespread corruption and human rights abuses. The government has been criticized for its authoritarian tendencies and suppression of opposition voices. Despite these challenges, the country has made efforts to improve its democratic institutions and promote economic development. The government has also sought to diversify its economy, which is heavily reliant on oil exports, and promote foreign investment.\n\nThe political system in Equatorial Guinea is influenced by the country's history and cultural context. The country gained independence from Spain in 1968 and has since been ruled by a series of authoritarian regimes. The current president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has been in power since 1979 and is one of the longest-serving heads of state in Africa. The government has also been criticized for its treatment of opposition groups and human rights activists, with many facing arrest, torture, and imprisonment.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo | Head of state and government, commander-in-chief of the armed forces |\n| Legislative | Chamber of People's Representatives | Speaker Gaudencio Mohaba Mesu | Unicameral legislature with 100 members, responsible for passing laws and approving the budget |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Highest court in the land, responsible for interpreting the constitution and laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) | Center-right, authoritarian | President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo | 99 | Dominant ruling party, founded in 1987 |\n| Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS) | Center-left, social democratic | Plácido Micó Abogo | 1 | Main opposition party, founded in 1990 |\n| Popular Action of Equatorial Guinea (APGE) | Center-right, liberal | Carmelo Modú | 0 | Small opposition party, founded in 2002 |\n| National Union for Democracy (UNDE) | Center-left, nationalist | Buenaventura Monsuy Asumu | 0 | Small opposition party, founded in 2007 |\n| Social Democratic Coalition Party (PCSD) | Center-left, social democratic | Guillermo Nguema Ela | 0 | Small opposition party, founded in 2010 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Equatorial Guinea is based on a simple majority system, where the candidate with the most votes wins the presidency.\n- Presidential elections are held every seven years, with the most recent election taking place in 2016.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled to take place in 2023, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n- Voter participation in Equatorial Guinea is relatively low, with turnout rates ranging from 30% to 50% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Equatorial Guinea is characterized by a lack of transparency and accountability, with widespread corruption and human rights abuses.\n- Key issues facing the country include poverty, inequality, and lack of access to basic services such as healthcare and education.\n- The country is also vulnerable to regional dynamics, including the threat of piracy and terrorism in the Gulf of Guinea.\n- Equatorial Guinea ranks poorly in terms of freedom indices, with a score of 4 out of 100 in the 2022 Freedom in the World report.\n- The country is also subject to international sanctions and criticism for its human rights record, including the use of torture and arbitrary detention.\n- The government has also been criticized for its treatment of opposition groups and human rights activists, with many facing arrest, torture, and imprisonment.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Equatorial Guinea is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS).\n- The country has close ties with other African countries, particularly in the Central African region.\n- Equatorial Guinea has also sought to strengthen its relations with European countries, particularly Spain and France, which are major investors in the country's oil sector.\n- The country has a complex relationship with the United States, which has imposed sanctions on the government for human rights abuses and corruption.\n- Equatorial Guinea is also a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and has sought to promote its energy interests through international cooperation.",
