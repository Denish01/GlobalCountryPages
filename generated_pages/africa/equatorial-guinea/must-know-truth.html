        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Equatorial Guinea is a sovereign country located in Central Africa, with a rich and complex history that spans over five centuries. The country was first inhabited by the Bantu people, who migrated to the region from other parts of Africa around the 2nd century BC. In the 15th century, the Portuguese arrived in the region, and in 1472, they established a settlement on the island of Fernando Pó (now known as Bioko). The Spanish took control of the island in 1778, and it remained a Spanish colony until Equatorial Guinea gained its independence on October 12, 1968.</p>
        <p>During the colonial period, the Spanish established a number of plantations and trading posts in the region, and the country became a major producer of <strong>cocoa</strong>, <strong>coffee</strong>, and <strong>timber</strong>. The Spanish also introduced <strong>Christianity</strong> to the region, which had a significant impact on the local culture. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Spanish expanded their control over the mainland territory, which is now divided into the provinces of Centro Sur, Kié-Ntem, Litoral, and Wele-Nzas.</p>
        <p>Equatorial Guinea's road to independence was long and difficult, with the country experiencing a number of different colonial administrators and governors. In 1959, the Spanish government granted the country a degree of autonomy, and in 1963, Equatorial Guinea became a self-governing province of Spain. However, it was not until October 12, 1968, that the country finally gained its full independence, with Francisco Macías Nguema as its first president.</p>
        <p>Since gaining independence, Equatorial Guinea has experienced a number of significant events, including a civil war in the 1970s and a period of rapid economic growth in the 1990s, driven by the discovery of <strong>oil</strong> and <strong>natural gas</strong> reserves. Today, the country is a member of the <strong>African Union</strong> and the <strong>United Nations</strong>, and it continues to play an important role in regional and international affairs.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Equatorial Guinea is a Spanish-speaking country only"</p>

        <p>Reality: While the country does face a number of development challenges, it is also home to significant <strong>oil</strong> and <strong>natural gas</strong> reserves, which have driven rapid economic growth in recent years. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Equatorial Guinea is a dangerous and unstable country"</p>

        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Equatorial Guinea is not a significant player in regional affairs"</p>
        <p>Reality: The country plays an important role in regional organizations, such as the <strong>Economic Community of Central African States</strong> and the <strong>Gulf of Guinea Commission</strong>, and it has also hosted a number of international events, including the <strong>African Cup of Nations</strong>.

        <h2>Challenges & Context</h2>

        <li>The country has a relatively low <strong>human development index</strong> (HDI) score, which reflects its challenges in areas such as <strong>education</strong>, <strong>health</strong>, and <strong>income</strong>.</li>
