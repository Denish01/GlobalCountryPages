[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Equatorial Guinea is characterized by a strong presidential system, where the president holds significant executive powers and serves as the head of state and government. The president is directly elected by popular vote for a seven-year term, with no term limits. The separation of powers is not clearly defined, and the executive branch dominates the legislative and judicial branches. The country has a unitary system, with a centralized government and limited autonomy for local authorities. The ruling party, the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE), has maintained a tight grip on power since its founding in 1987.

The political system in Equatorial Guinea is also marked by a lack of transparency and accountability, with widespread corruption and human rights abuses. The government has been criticized for its authoritarian tendencies and suppression of opposition voices. Despite these challenges, the country has made efforts to improve its democratic institutions and promote economic development. The government has also sought to diversify its economy, which is heavily reliant on oil exports, and promote foreign investment.

The political system in Equatorial Guinea is influenced by the country's history and cultural context. The country gained independence from Spain in 1968 and has since been ruled by a series of authoritarian regimes. The current president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has been in power since 1979 and is one of the longest-serving heads of state in Africa. The government has also been criticized for its treatment of opposition groups and human rights activists, with many facing arrest, torture, and imprisonment.
