The country has a diverse ethnic makeup, with over 80% of the population identifying as Bantu, while the remaining 20% comprises various other ethnic groups, including the Fang, Bubi, and Annobonese. The official languages, Spanish, French, and Portuguese, reflect the country's colonial past and continue to play a significant role in shaping the culture. The majority of the population practices Christianity, with a smaller percentage adhering to traditional African religions.\n\nThe cultural identity of Equatorial Guinea is also defined by its strong traditions and customs, which are often centered around family and community.

This emphasis on community is reflected in the country's vibrant festivals and celebrations, which often feature traditional music, dance, and cuisine. The cultural landscape is further enriched by the country's stunning natural beauty, with lush rainforests, pristine beaches, and volcanic landscapes providing a unique backdrop for cultural expression.\n\nDespite its rich cultural heritage, Equatorial Guinea faces challenges in preserving its traditions and customs in the face of modernization and urbanization. Efforts are being made to promote cultural awareness and education, particularly among younger generations, to ensure the continued transmission of Equatoguinean cultural values and practices. The government has also implemented initiatives to support local artists, musicians, and craftspeople, recognizing the importance of cultural expression in shaping the country's identity and promoting national pride.\n\n[SECTION] Food & Cuisine [/SECTION]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Must-Try? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Calulu | Stew | A hearty fish or meat stew made with palm oil, spices, and leafy greens | Yes |\n| Akara | Fritter | Fried bean cakes often served with a spicy tomato sauce | Yes |\n| Suya | Skewer | Grilled meat skewers, typically made with beef or chicken, and served with a side of spicy peanut sauce | Yes |\n| Ekwang | Dish | A traditional dish made with cooked plantains, cassava, or yams, often served with a sauce or stew | No |\n| Mongozo | Drink | A sweet, fermented drink made from palm sap | Yes |\n| Malamba | Dish | A sweet, fried doughnut-like pastry, often coated in sugar or honey | Yes |\n| Pepper Pot Soup | Soup | A spicy, flavorful soup made with a variety of meats and vegetables | Yes |\n| Grilled Fish | Dish | Fresh fish grilled over an open flame, often served with a side of fried plantains or rice | Yes |\n\nEquatoguinean cuisine is a flavorful reflection of the country's cultural diversity, with influences from African, Spanish, French, and Portuguese traditions.
