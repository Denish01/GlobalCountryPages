Equatorial Guinea has a high-income economy, driven by its oil and gas sector, while Gabon has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on timber, mining, and agriculture. The cost of living in Equatorial Guinea is generally higher due to its limited market and high demand for goods and services. In contrast, Gabon has a more competitive market, which helps keep prices lower. Overall, Gabon is the more affordable option, with a cost of living that is around 15-20% lower than Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Equatorial Guinea's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which can lead to fluctuations in the cost of living. In contrast, Gabon's diversified economy provides a more stable environment, with less volatility in prices. Additionally, Gabon has a more developed infrastructure, including a better transportation system and more affordable housing options. As a result, Gabon is generally the more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle in Central Africa.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Equatorial Guinea (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 900 | 25% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 800 | 600 | 25% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Equatorial Guinea (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 400 | 20% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 4 | 20% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 33% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Equatorial Guinea (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 30 | 40% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1.5 | 25% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1 | 17% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Equatorial Guinea (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 80 | 60 | 25% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 30 | 20 | 33% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Equatorial Guinea (USD) | Gabon (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,200 | 20% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 2,000 | 20% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 3,200 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Equatorial Guinea is cheaper for:**\n- High-end dining experiences\n- Luxury accommodations\n- Private transportation services\n- **Gabon is cheaper for:**\n- Groceries and basic food items\n- Public transportation\n- Utilities and internet services\n- Mid-range accommodations\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle and priorities.
