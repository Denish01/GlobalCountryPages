The market is largely driven by the oil and gas industry, which has attracted a significant number of expatriates and foreign investors. As a result, there is a high demand for luxury properties, including apartments and villas, in prime locations. The price trajectory of the property market in Equatorial Guinea has been steadily increasing over the years, with a significant spike in prices in recent years due to the country's growing economy.\n\nThe urban areas, such as Malabo and Bata, offer a range of modern amenities, including shopping centers, restaurants, and entertainment facilities, making them attractive to foreigners and locals alike. In contrast, the rural areas are largely undeveloped, with limited access to basic amenities, such as electricity and water. However, the government has been investing in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads and bridges, which is expected to boost the property market in these areas.\n\nThe current market conditions in Equatorial Guinea are characterized by a shortage of housing, particularly in the mid-range segment, which has led to an increase in prices. The government has introduced measures to stimulate the property market, including the creation of a housing fund to provide financing for low-income households. However, the market is still largely unregulated, and foreigners may face challenges when buying or renting property.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Malabo | 2,000 | 1,500 | Apartment |\n| Bata | 1,500 | 1,000 | House |\n| Mongomo | 1,000 | 800 | Villa |\n| Luba | 800 | 600 | Apartment |\n| Ebebiyin | 600 | 400 | House |\n| Aconibe | 500 | 300 | Villa |\n| Moka | 400 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Evinayong | 300 | 150 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are allowed to buy property in Equatorial Guinea, but they must obtain a residence permit and register with the local authorities.\n- Foreign companies can also buy property, but they must be registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n- Foreigners are restricted from buying property in certain areas, such as military zones and sensitive ecological areas.\n- Foreigners can lease property for up to 99 years, but they must pay an annual rent to the government.\n- Foreigners must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Urban Planning and Housing to buy or lease property.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
