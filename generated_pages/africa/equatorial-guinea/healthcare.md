[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Equatorial Guinea is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by health centers and clinics, while secondary care is provided by district hospitals, and tertiary care is provided by regional and national hospitals. However, the quality of care varies significantly between public and private providers, with private facilities generally offering better quality care. In urban areas, such as Malabo and Bata, access to healthcare is relatively better, with more facilities and specialized services available. In contrast, rural areas face significant challenges in terms of access to healthcare, with limited facilities and a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals.

The public healthcare system in Equatorial Guinea is underfunded and understaffed, leading to a reliance on private providers for many citizens. However, private healthcare is often expensive and inaccessible to many people, particularly in rural areas. The government has implemented some initiatives to improve healthcare, such as the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, but more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system.

Despite these challenges, there are some positive developments in the healthcare sector in Equatorial Guinea. For example, the country has made significant progress in reducing the incidence of certain diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis. Additionally, there are some excellent private healthcare facilities in the country, particularly in Malabo, which offer high-quality care to those who can afford it.
