  "content": "The education system in Equatorial Guinea is characterized by a mix of public and private institutions, with a growing focus on improving access to quality education, although it still faces significant challenges. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 95.3%\nSchool System: 8 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Spanish\nAcademic Calendar: 9 months\nInternational Schools: limited\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the lowest 20% globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Equatorial Guinea is structured into three main levels: **primary**, **secondary**, and **tertiary** education. Primary education lasts for six years, followed by two years of secondary education, and students who pass the required exams can then proceed to tertiary education. The quality of education varies significantly between public and private institutions, with private schools generally offering better facilities and more qualified teachers. Public schools, on the other hand, often struggle with inadequate resources, outdated curricula, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has been working to improve the education system, with a focus on increasing access to education, particularly for girls and rural communities.\n\nThe education system in Equatorial Guinea is also influenced by the country's colonial history, with Spanish, French, and Portuguese being the official languages. This has resulted in a unique blend of cultural and linguistic influences, with students often studying in multiple languages. However, this can also create challenges, particularly for students who may not speak these languages at home. To address this, the government has implemented programs to support language learning and to promote the use of local languages in education.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing focus on improving the quality of education in Equatorial Guinea, with a particular emphasis on **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** education. This has included initiatives to provide training for teachers, to update curricula, and to introduce new technologies into the classroom. However, despite these efforts, the education system in Equatorial Guinea still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
