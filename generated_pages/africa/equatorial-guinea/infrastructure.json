  "content": "The infrastructure in Equatorial Guinea is relatively underdeveloped, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 66.6% of population\nInternet Penetration: 23.7%\nRoad Network: 2,880 km, with moderate quality and limited connectivity to rural areas\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 6\nMajor Ports: 3, including the major port of Bata and the oil terminal at Luba\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nEquatorial Guinea has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, driven primarily by its oil and gas sector. However, the country still faces significant challenges in providing basic services to its population, particularly in rural areas. The government has implemented various development plans to improve the country's infrastructure, including the **Horizon 2020** development plan, which aims to diversify the economy and improve living standards. Despite these efforts, the country's infrastructure development is still hindered by limited institutional capacity, corruption, and a lack of transparency.\n\nThe urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is significant, with cities such as Malabo and Bata having relatively better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. However, rural areas continue to lag behind, with many communities relying on traditional sources of energy and water. The government has recognized the need to address this gap and has implemented various initiatives to improve access to basic services in rural areas.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development has also been driven by its strategic location in the Gulf of Guinea, which has made it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region. The government has invested in the development of its ports and airports, which has helped to boost trade and economic growth. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of its transportation infrastructure, including the lack of a rail network and limited connectivity to rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 2,880 km | Moderate | Limited connectivity to rural areas, with many roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in the country |\n| Airports | 6 international, 2 domestic | Good | Major airports include Malabo International Airport and Bata Airport |\n| Ports | 3 major | Good | Major ports include the port of Bata and the oil terminal at Luba |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The country's power generation is primarily based on **thermal energy**, with a total installed capacity of 227 MW.\n- The electricity sector is dominated by the state-owned company, **SEGESA**, which is responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution.\n- The country's electricity access rate is around 66.6%, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas.\n- The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the reliability of the electricity supply, including the development of new power plants and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.\n- The country has also made progress in promoting **renewable energy**, with a number of solar and wind power projects under development.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- The country's water sector is characterized by limited access to **safe drinking water**, particularly in rural areas.\n- The water supply system is managed by the state-owned company, **SGE**, which is responsible for the production and distribution of water.\n- Sanitation coverage is also limited, with many households relying on traditional latrines and septic tanks.\n- The government has implemented various initiatives to improve access to water and sanitation, including the development of new water treatment plants and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.\n- The country has also made progress in promoting **hygiene and sanitation** practices, particularly in schools and healthcare facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- The country's telecommunications sector is dominated by the state-owned company, **GETESA**, which provides fixed-line and mobile services.\n- Mobile phone penetration is relatively high, with around 80% of the population having access to a mobile phone.\n- The country has also made progress in promoting **broadband internet** services, with a number of internet service providers operating in the country.\n- The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the telecommunications infrastructure, including the development of new fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.\n- The country has also made progress in promoting **e-government** services, with a number of online platforms available for citizens to access public services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has implemented various development projects to improve the country's infrastructure, including the **Malabo-Bata highway** project, which aims to improve connectivity between the two major cities.\n- The country has also received funding from international organizations such as the **World Bank** and the **African Development Bank** to support infrastructure development projects.\n- The government has also implemented various initiatives to promote **private sector investment** in infrastructure development, including the creation of a dedicated investment promotion agency.\n- The country has also made progress in promoting **sustainable infrastructure** development, with a number of projects under development that aim to reduce the country's carbon footprint.\n- The government has also implemented various initiatives to improve the **governance and management** of infrastructure development projects, including the creation of a dedicated infrastructure development agency.",
