However, the government has been investing in upgrading the infrastructure, and costs have been relatively stable in recent years. The inflation rate of 2.9% in 2024 has had a moderate impact on utility costs, with prices increasing slightly over the past year. Seasonal variation in utility costs is minimal, as the country's tropical climate means that heating and cooling costs are relatively consistent throughout the year.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Equatorial Guinea can vary depending on the location and provider. In general, urban areas such as Malabo tend to have better access to reliable utilities, while rural areas may experience more frequent outages and disruptions. The cost of utilities can also vary depending on the provider and the specific services used. For example, electricity costs can range from $0.20 to $0.30 per kWh, depending on the provider and the amount of energy used.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-75 | 10 Mbps | GETESA, Orange |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 60 Mbps | GETESA, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Orange, Movil |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Orange, Movil |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $75-150 | varies | GETESA, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Equatorial Guinea, it is recommended to contact the provider directly and provide proof of address and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a cost-effective option for those who want to control their energy usage and avoid surprise bills.\n- The best internet providers in Equatorial Guinea are GETESA and Orange, which offer reliable and fast connections.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances and turn off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
