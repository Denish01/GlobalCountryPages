[/SECTION]\nEquatorial Guinea is considered one of the most expensive countries in Africa, with a high cost of living. The country's economy is largely driven by its oil and gas industry, which has led to a significant influx of foreign workers and a subsequent increase in prices. Compared to its neighbors, Cameroon and Gabon, Equatorial Guinea is more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being significantly higher. The country's remote location and limited infrastructure also contribute to the high cost of living.\n\nThe high cost of living in Equatorial Guinea is also due to the limited availability of certain goods and services, which can drive up prices. Additionally, the country's strict regulations and limited competition in certain sectors can also contribute to higher prices. However, for those who can afford it, Equatorial Guinea offers a unique and exciting experience, with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-60 | Basic rooms with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $100-200 | Comfortable rooms with private facilities, TV, and air conditioning |\n| Luxury/Resort | $250-500 | High-end rooms with private facilities, TV, air conditioning, and access to amenities like pools and gyms |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $800-2,000 | City center apartments with 2-3 bedrooms, kitchen, and living area |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-60 |\n| Fine Dining | $60-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-2 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $5-10 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 800 | 1,500 | 2,500 |\n| Food | 300 | 600 | 1,000 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **1,500** | **3,000** | **5,000** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider sharing an apartment with others to reduce rent costs\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls, which are often cheaper than mid-range restaurants\n- Use public transportation or walk instead of taking taxis\n- Buy groceries at local markets instead of supermarkets\n- Avoid traveling during peak season (December to February) when prices are higher\n- Learn some basic Spanish or French to negotiate prices and get better deals\n\nNote: Prices are approximate and can vary depending on the location, season, and other factors.
