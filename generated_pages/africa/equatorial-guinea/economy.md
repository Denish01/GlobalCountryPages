[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Equatorial Guinea has an upper-middle-income economy, driven primarily by its vast oil and gas reserves. The country's economy has experienced significant growth since the discovery of oil in the 1990s, with the oil and gas sector dominating the economy. However, this has also led to a lack of diversification, making the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. The country's development level is relatively high compared to other African nations, but it still faces significant challenges in terms of poverty reduction and infrastructure development.

The economy of Equatorial Guinea is characterized by a large informal sector, with many citizens engaged in subsistence farming and small-scale trading. The government has implemented various policies to diversify the economy, including investing in infrastructure and promoting foreign investment. However, corruption and a lack of transparency have hindered these efforts, and the country's business environment remains challenging. The country's economic trajectory is closely tied to the oil and gas sector, and the government is working to reduce its dependence on this sector and promote economic diversification.

Despite the challenges, Equatorial Guinea has made significant progress in recent years, with the government investing in infrastructure and human capital. The country has also made efforts to improve its business environment, including simplifying regulatory procedures and promoting foreign investment. However, more needs to be done to address the country's development challenges and ensure sustainable economic growth.
