# Best Time to Visit Equatorial Guinea — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Equatorial Guinea is during the dry season, from December to February, when the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploration.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Equatorial Guinea: December to February. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: March to May. Avoid: September to November due to heavy rainfall and high humidity. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Equatorial Guinea has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to February, is characterized by cooler temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from March to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for travel. The country's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the coastal regions experiencing a more moderate climate than the interior. The **rainforest** regions, which cover a significant part of the country, are particularly prone to heavy rainfall during the wet season.

The dry season is the best time to visit Equatorial Guinea's **national parks** and **wildlife reserves**, as the weather is cooler and drier, making it easier to spot wildlife. The wet season, on the other hand, is best for **birdwatching**, as many bird species migrate to the country during this time. However, the heavy rainfall and high humidity can make travel difficult, and some roads may become impassable.

The country's climate also affects the **agricultural** sector, with the wet season being the best time for planting and harvesting crops. The dry season, on the other hand, is best for **fishing**, as the cooler waters make it easier to catch fish.
