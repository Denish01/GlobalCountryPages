The country's oil-driven economy has led to a high demand for housing, especially from expatriates and foreigners working in the oil and gas industry. As a result, rental prices are relatively high compared to other countries in the region. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and it is essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Cameroon and Gabon, Equatorial Guinea's housing costs are significantly higher, reflecting the country's unique economic situation.\n\nThe housing market in Equatorial Guinea is also characterized by a shortage of quality housing, particularly in the city center. Many apartments and houses are old and in need of renovation, which can drive up prices. Additionally, the country's infrastructure is still developing, and amenities such as electricity, water, and internet may not be as reliable as in other countries. Despite these challenges, Equatorial Guinea's housing market offers a unique opportunity for investors and renters to experience the country's vibrant culture and stunning natural beauty.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $400-$700 | $200-$400 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $300-$600 | Standard apartment, 1 bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $900-$1,500 | $500-$900 | Family-size apartment, 2 bathrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,500 | $800-$1,500 | Spacious apartment, 3 bathrooms, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$4,000 | Prime locations, luxury apartments |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,500 | Residential areas, family homes |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | Agricultural land, rural homes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Malabo City Center**: $800-$1,500 per month for a 2-bedroom apartment, convenient location, amenities, and services\n- **Elia**: $500-$1,000 per month for a 2-bedroom apartment, suburban area, quieter, family-friendly\n- **Riaba**: $400-$800 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, coastal area, scenic views\n- **Basaku**: $300-$600 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, local neighborhood, affordable, authentic experience\n- **Punta Europa**: $1,000-$2,000 per month for a 3-bedroom apartment, luxury area, modern amenities, expat community\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Equatorial Guinea [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your housing search to get a sense of the local market\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable apartment\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease agreement to avoid any potential issues\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms to get the best possible deal\n- Be prepared for **outages** and **infrastructure challenges** by having a backup plan for electricity, water, and internet\n- Consider **furnished** apartments, as they are more common in Equatorial Guinea, and **unfurnished** apartments may require additional setup and investment",
