  "content": "Healthcare in Equatorial Guinea is a mixed system, with a combination of public and private providers, but it faces significant challenges in terms of quality, access, and resources.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Equatorial Guinea is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by health centers and clinics, while secondary care is provided by district hospitals, and tertiary care is provided by regional and national hospitals. However, the quality of care varies significantly between public and private providers, with private facilities generally offering better quality care. In urban areas, such as Malabo and Bata, access to healthcare is relatively better, with more facilities and specialized services available. In contrast, rural areas face significant challenges in terms of access to healthcare, with limited facilities and a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Equatorial Guinea is underfunded and understaffed, leading to a reliance on private providers for many citizens. However, private healthcare is often expensive and inaccessible to many people, particularly in rural areas. The government has implemented some initiatives to improve healthcare, such as the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, but more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are some positive developments in the healthcare sector in Equatorial Guinea. For example, the country has made significant progress in reducing the incidence of certain diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis. Additionally, there are some excellent private healthcare facilities in the country, particularly in Malabo, which offer high-quality care to those who can afford it.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Malabo General Hospital | Malabo | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Bata Regional Hospital | Bata | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| La Paz Medical Center | Malabo | Private | Cardiology, oncology, neurology | Yes |\n| Clinica Elaven | Malabo | Private | General medicine, dentistry, ophthalmology | Yes |\n| Hopital General de Mongomo | Mongomo | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Centro Medico de Mbini | Mbini | Private | General medicine, pediatrics, gynecology | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all visitors and expats, as it provides access to better quality care and more comprehensive coverage.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expats** should consider purchasing international health insurance that covers them in Equatorial Guinea and other countries.\n- **Costs** of healthcare in Equatorial Guinea can be high, particularly in private facilities, so insurance is essential to avoid financial hardship.\n- **Government insurance schemes** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as private insurance plans.\n- **Group insurance plans** are available for companies and organizations, and can provide more comprehensive coverage for employees.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are available in major cities, but may be in short supply in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, but may be more expensive than in other countries.\n- **Costs** of medications can be high, particularly for specialized or imported medications.\n- **Pharmacy access** is limited in rural areas, where people may have to travel long distances to access basic medications.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for all travelers to Equatorial Guinea.\n- **Malaria** is a significant health risk in Equatorial Guinea, and travelers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- **Hepatitis A and B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers.\n- **Typhoid** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be spending time around animals.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Equatorial Guinea, and travelers should avoid drinking tap water or eating unpeeled fruits and vegetables.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Equatorial Guinea, due to the limited availability of specialized medical services.\n- **Some private hospitals** in Malabo and Bata may offer specialized services, such as cardiology or orthopedic surgery.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for certain procedures, but the overall quality of care may not be comparable to that in other countries.\n- **Accreditation** of hospitals and medical facilities is not always rigorous, so travelers should research carefully before seeking medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency services** are limited in Equatorial Guinea, and travelers should be prepared for emergencies by having a plan in place.\n- **Ambulance services** are available in major cities, but may not be reliable in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** should be identified in advance, in case of an emergency.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed promptly, to avoid delays in reimbursement.\n- **Emergency contact numbers** should be kept handy, such as the emergency number 112.",
