Equatorial Guinea has a relatively high cost of living, particularly in the capital city of Malabo. The country's GDP per capita (PPP) of $17,567 indicates a moderate to high level of economic development, which is reflected in the prices of goods and services. A budget lifestyle in Equatorial Guinea would likely involve shared accommodation, cooking most meals at home, and using public transportation, while a mid-range lifestyle would allow for more comfort and flexibility, including a one-bedroom apartment in the city center and occasional dining out. A comfortable lifestyle, on the other hand, would provide a high level of luxury, including a nice two-bedroom apartment, frequent dining out, and regular travel.

Compared to neighboring countries, Equatorial Guinea is more expensive than Cameroon and Gabon.
