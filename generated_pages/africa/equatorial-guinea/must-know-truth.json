  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nEquatorial Guinea is a sovereign country located in Central Africa, with a rich and complex history that spans over five centuries. The country was first inhabited by the Bantu people, who migrated to the region from other parts of Africa around the 2nd century BC. In the 15th century, the Portuguese arrived in the region, and in 1472, they established a settlement on the island of Fernando Pó (now known as Bioko). The Spanish took control of the island in 1778, and it remained a Spanish colony until Equatorial Guinea gained its independence on October 12, 1968.\n\nDuring the colonial period, the Spanish established a number of plantations and trading posts in the region, and the country became a major producer of **cocoa**, **coffee**, and **timber**.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Spanish expanded their control over the mainland territory, which is now divided into the provinces of Centro Sur, Kié-Ntem, Litoral, and Wele-Nzas.\n\nEquatorial Guinea's road to independence was long and difficult, with the country experiencing a number of different colonial administrators and governors. In 1959, the Spanish government granted the country a degree of autonomy, and in 1963, Equatorial Guinea became a self-governing province of Spain. However, it was not until October 12, 1968, that the country finally gained its full independence, with Francisco Macías Nguema as its first president.\n\nSince gaining independence, Equatorial Guinea has experienced a number of significant events, including a civil war in the 1970s and a period of rapid economic growth in the 1990s, driven by the discovery of **oil** and **natural gas** reserves.
