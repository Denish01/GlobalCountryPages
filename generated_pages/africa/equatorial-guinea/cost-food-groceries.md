[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Equatorial Guinea are generally higher compared to the regional average, due to the country's limited agricultural production and reliance on imports. The cost of food is driven up by factors such as transportation costs, taxes, and the limited competition in the market. Eating out is not a common practice in Equatorial Guinea, with most people preferring to cook at home due to the high cost of restaurant meals. However, in urban areas like Malabo, there is a growing trend of eating out, particularly among the expat community and the wealthy locals.

The high cost of food in Equatorial Guinea is also reflected in the limited availability of certain products, particularly fresh produce. The country's **tropical climate** and **poor infrastructure** make it difficult to transport and store perishable goods, resulting in a limited selection of fresh fruits and vegetables. As a result, many people rely on **canned goods** and **imported products**, which are often more expensive. Despite these challenges, the government has been working to improve the country's **agricultural sector**, with initiatives aimed at increasing local production and reducing reliance on imports.
