[SECTION] How Expensive Is Equatorial Guinea? [/SECTION]
Equatorial Guinea is considered one of the most expensive countries in Africa, with a high cost of living. The country's economy is largely driven by its oil and gas industry, which has led to a significant influx of foreign workers and a subsequent increase in prices. Compared to its neighbors, Cameroon and Gabon, Equatorial Guinea is more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being significantly higher. The country's remote location and limited infrastructure also contribute to the high cost of living.

The high cost of living in Equatorial Guinea is also due to the limited availability of certain goods and services, which can drive up prices. Additionally, the country's strict regulations and limited competition in certain sectors can also contribute to higher prices. However, for those who can afford it, Equatorial Guinea offers a unique and exciting experience, with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.
