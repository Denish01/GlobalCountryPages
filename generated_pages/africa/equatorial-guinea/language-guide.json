  "content": "The primary languages spoken in Equatorial Guinea are Spanish, French, and Portuguese, with Spanish being the most widely spoken and the country's official language.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Spanish, French, Portuguese\nWidely Spoken: Fang, Bubi, and other local languages\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance, Bantu\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nEquatorial Guinea's linguistic landscape is diverse, with over 40 languages spoken across the country. The official languages, Spanish, French, and Portuguese, are a legacy of the country's colonial past. Spanish is the most widely spoken language, particularly in the capital city of Malabo, while French is more commonly spoken in the southern regions. Portuguese is also widely spoken, particularly in the coastal areas. In addition to the official languages, there are many local languages, including Fang and Bubi, which are spoken by various ethnic groups. English is not widely spoken, and proficiency is generally low, particularly outside of the capital city.\n\nRegional dialects also play a significant role in Equatorial Guinea's linguistic landscape. For example, the Fang language has several dialects, including the Okak and the Ntumu. These dialects can be quite different from one another, and speakers of one dialect may not always understand speakers of another. Minority languages, such as the Bubi language, are also spoken in the country, particularly in the island of Bioko.\n\nDespite the country's linguistic diversity, English is not widely understood, and visitors may find it challenging to communicate with locals. However, many Equatoguineans, particularly younger people and those in the tourism industry, are making an effort to learn English. It is still essential for visitors to learn basic phrases in Spanish, French, or Portuguese to communicate effectively with locals.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola | OH-lah | formal |\n| Hello | Buenos días | BWEH-nohs DEE-ahs | formal, daytime |\n| Thank you | Gracias | GRAH-see-ahs | formal |\n| Please | Por favor | pawr fah-VOHR | formal |\n| Yes / No | Sí / No | SEE / noh | formal |\n| Excuse me | Con permiso | kohn pehr-MEE-soh | formal |\n| How much? | Cuánto cuesta | KWAHN-toh KWEHS-tah | formal |\n| Where is...? | Dónde está...? | DOHN-deh EH-stah | formal |\n| I don't understand | No entiendo | noh ehn-tee-EHN-doh | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | ¿Habla inglés? | AHB-lah eeng-lee-EHZ | formal |\n| Help! | ¡Ayuda! | ah-YOO-dah | formal |\n| Goodbye | Adiós | ah-DEE-yos | formal |\n| Sorry | Lo siento | LOH see-en-toh | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Uno | oo-noh |\n| 2 | Dos | dohs |\n| 3 | Tres | trays |\n| 4 | Cuatro | kwah-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | sing-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | says |\n| 7 | Siete | see-eht-eh |\n| 8 | Ocho | OH-choh |\n| 9 | Nueve | nway-vay |\n| 10 | Diez | dee-EHZ |\n| 100 | Cien | see-EHN |\n| 1000 | Mil | meel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when interacting with locals, using formal titles such as \"señor\" or \"señora\" when addressing older individuals.\n- Learn basic phrases in Spanish, French, or Portuguese to show appreciation for the local culture.\n- Use **body language** to convey respect, such as avoiding direct eye contact with older individuals.\n- Avoid using **gestures** that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the left hand.\n- Be prepared to **haggle** when shopping at markets, as this is a common practice in Equatorial Guinea.\n- Learn about local **customs** and **traditions** to avoid unintentionally offending locals.\n- Bring a **phrasebook** or use a **translation app** to help communicate with locals.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a **translation app**, such as Google Translate, to help communicate with locals.\n- Bring a **phrasebook** or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Consider taking a **language course** before traveling to Equatorial Guinea to learn basic Spanish, French, or Portuguese.\n- Use **online resources**, such as language learning websites or forums, to learn more about the local culture and language.\n- Hire a **local guide** or interpreter to help navigate the country and communicate with locals.",
