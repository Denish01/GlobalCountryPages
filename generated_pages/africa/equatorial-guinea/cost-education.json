  "content": "The cost of education in Equatorial Guinea varies significantly between public and private institutions, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): Not available\nLiteracy Rate: 95.3%\nSchool System: 6 years of primary education, 4 years of secondary education, and 2-3 years of higher education\nAcademic Year: 10 months\nCurrency: XAF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Equatorial Guinea is primarily based on the Spanish and French systems, with Spanish being the predominant language of instruction. The country has a 6-4-2 education system, where students attend primary school for 6 years, followed by 4 years of secondary school, and then 2-3 years of higher education. Public education is generally free or subsidized, but the quality can vary significantly depending on the location and availability of resources. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of Malabo, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.\n\nThe education system in Equatorial Guinea faces several challenges, including a lack of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, the country has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly at the primary level. However, there is still a significant gap in the quality of education between public and private schools, and between urban and rural areas. Expatriates and international students often opt for private or international schools, which offer a higher quality of education and a more familiar curriculum.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary significantly depending on location |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range depends on tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary significantly depending on location |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range depends on tier and location |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | Offers International Baccalaureate, British GCSE, and other curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited programs and resources |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Offers a range of programs, including business and engineering |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial, offers a range of programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited availability, especially outside of Malabo |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Can be arranged through private schools or individual tutors |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Offers courses in Spanish, French, and Portuguese |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Can be purchased at local markets or online |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most private and public schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats are generally private or international schools, which offer a higher quality of education and a more familiar curriculum.\n- Scholarship availability is limited, but some universities and private schools offer scholarships to local and international students.\n- Online learning options are limited, but some universities and private schools offer online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in Equatorial Guinea is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, due to a lack of resources and qualified teachers.\n- [CALLOUT] It is essential to research and visit schools before making a decision, as the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the location and type of school.\n- The **Spanish** and **French** languages are widely spoken in Equatorial Guinea, and proficiency in one or both of these languages can be beneficial for students and expatriates.",
