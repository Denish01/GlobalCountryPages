  "content": "The cost of transportation in Equatorial Guinea varies widely, with a monthly transit pass costing around $25 USD, while a taxi start rate can range from $5 to $10 USD, and fuel prices are around $1.20 USD per liter.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($25 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($5-10 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.20 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (Yes — apps like Yango, Bolt)\nCurrency: XAF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nEquatorial Guinea has a limited but developing transportation network, with most people relying on **taxis**, **minibuses**, and **private cars** to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of punctuality being common issues. However, the country is investing in infrastructure development, including road construction and improvement of public transportation systems. In the capital city of Malabo, there are some **bus services** available, but they are not very frequent, and the coverage is limited.\n\nThe majority of the population relies on **informal transportation** methods, such as **motorcycle taxis** and **shared taxis**, which are widely available and relatively affordable. However, these services can be hazardous, especially for foreigners, and it is essential to exercise caution when using them. The government is working to improve the safety and reliability of these services, but more needs to be done to address the transportation challenges faced by the population.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $15-$20 | Limited coverage, overcrowding |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Frequent, but can be hazardous |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5-$10 | $1-$2 | $10-$20 | Not always available |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3-$5 | $1-$2 | $10-$20 | Yango, Bolt available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited frequencies, poor road conditions |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, e.g., Malabo to Bata |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **shared taxis** or **minibuses**, which are generally cheaper than metered taxis.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Yango or Bolt, which can be more convenient and safer than traditional taxis.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a taxi, especially if you're not using a metered taxi.\n- Be cautious when using **informal transportation** methods, such as motorcycle taxis, and always wear a helmet.\n- Consider **renting a car** for longer trips or for more comfort, but be aware of the **poor road conditions** in some areas.\n- Download **transportation apps** like Trafi or Rome2rio to help you navigate the transportation network in Equatorial Guinea.",
