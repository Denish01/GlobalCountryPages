[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Equatorial Guinea has a limited but developing transportation network, with most people relying on **taxis**, **minibuses**, and **private cars** to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of punctuality being common issues. However, the country is investing in infrastructure development, including road construction and improvement of public transportation systems. In the capital city of Malabo, there are some **bus services** available, but they are not very frequent, and the coverage is limited.

The majority of the population relies on **informal transportation** methods, such as **motorcycle taxis** and **shared taxis**, which are widely available and relatively affordable. However, these services can be hazardous, especially for foreigners, and it is essential to exercise caution when using them. The government is working to improve the safety and reliability of these services, but more needs to be done to address the transportation challenges faced by the population.
