[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Equatorial Guinea has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, driven primarily by its oil and gas sector. However, the country still faces significant challenges in providing basic services to its population, particularly in rural areas. The government has implemented various development plans to improve the country's infrastructure, including the **Horizon 2020** development plan, which aims to diversify the economy and improve living standards. Despite these efforts, the country's infrastructure development is still hindered by limited institutional capacity, corruption, and a lack of transparency.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is significant, with cities such as Malabo and Bata having relatively better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. However, rural areas continue to lag behind, with many communities relying on traditional sources of energy and water. The government has recognized the need to address this gap and has implemented various initiatives to improve access to basic services in rural areas.

The country's infrastructure development has also been driven by its strategic location in the Gulf of Guinea, which has made it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region. The government has invested in the development of its ports and airports, which has helped to boost trade and economic growth. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of its transportation infrastructure, including the lack of a rail network and limited connectivity to rural areas.
