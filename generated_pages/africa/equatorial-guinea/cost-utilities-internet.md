[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Equatorial Guinea is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages. However, the government has been investing in upgrading the infrastructure, and costs have been relatively stable in recent years. The inflation rate of 2.9% in 2024 has had a moderate impact on utility costs, with prices increasing slightly over the past year. Seasonal variation in utility costs is minimal, as the country's tropical climate means that heating and cooling costs are relatively consistent throughout the year.

The quality of utility services in Equatorial Guinea can vary depending on the location and provider. In general, urban areas such as Malabo tend to have better access to reliable utilities, while rural areas may experience more frequent outages and disruptions. The cost of utilities can also vary depending on the provider and the specific services used. For example, electricity costs can range from $0.20 to $0.30 per kWh, depending on the provider and the amount of energy used.
