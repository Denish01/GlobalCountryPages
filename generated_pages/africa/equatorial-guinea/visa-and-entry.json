[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nEquatorial Guinea has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. Only a few countries, such as Cameroon and Gabon, are exempt from visa requirements due to their membership in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). Citizens of other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and European Union member states, must obtain a visa prior to arrival. The country's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate international travel and trade with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.\n\nThe visa application process in Equatorial Guinea can be complex and time-consuming, requiring applicants to submit a range of documents and wait for approval from the relevant authorities. In general, visa applicants must demonstrate that they have a legitimate reason for traveling to Equatorial Guinea, such as tourism, business, or education, and that they have sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay. The country's visa policy is subject to change, and applicants should always check with the official embassy or consulate of Equatorial Guinea for the latest information and requirements.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 90 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 90 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 90 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 90 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 90 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 60 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 60 days | Must apply in advance through the embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists must obtain a tourist visa, which is valid for a maximum stay of 90 days.
