# Mali Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Mali's infrastructure is largely underdeveloped, with significant gaps in access to electricity, clean water, and reliable transportation, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 34.4% of population
Internet Penetration: 12.7%
Road Network: 22,474 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: 729 km
Major Airports: 8
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Mali's infrastructure development level is relatively low, with many challenges hindering the country's economic growth and social development. Recent investments have focused on improving the road network, expanding access to electricity, and developing the telecommunications sector. However, the urban-rural gap remains significant, with cities like Bamako and Sikasso enjoying better infrastructure services than rural areas. The government has launched several initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural roads and the expansion of electricity access to rural communities.

Mali's infrastructure development is also constrained by its landlocked location, which increases the cost of transporting goods and people. The country relies heavily on its neighbors, particularly Senegal and Ivory Coast, for access to sea ports. Despite these challenges, Mali has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in the energy and transportation sectors. The government has also launched initiatives to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, including public-private partnerships and concessions.

The development of Mali's infrastructure is critical to the country's economic growth and social development. The government has recognized the importance of investing in infrastructure and has launched several initiatives to improve the country's roads, energy sector, and telecommunications network. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps, particularly in rural areas.
