[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Mali's utility infrastructure is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher prices during the dry season (November to May) due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has implemented measures to improve the utility infrastructure, including investments in renewable energy and water management systems. However, the costs of utilities are still relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

The quality of utility services in Mali varies depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to electricity, water, and sanitation than rural areas. The cost of utilities is also affected by the inflation rate, which was 3.2% in 2024. To mitigate the impact of fluctuating utility costs, households can consider using prepaid electricity meters, which allow them to control their energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.
