  "content": "Mali is generally cheaper than Niger, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMali GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,041\nNiger GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,252\nMali Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nNiger Inflation Rate: 2.8%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Mali\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Mali vs Niger [/SECTION]\nMali and Niger are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with similar economic and cultural contexts. However, there are significant differences in their cost of living, with Mali being generally cheaper than Niger. The main reason for this difference is the lower cost of housing, food, and transportation in Mali. Additionally, Mali has a more developed economy and a larger population, which can lead to economies of scale and lower prices. On the other hand, Niger is a smaller and more rural country, with a less developed infrastructure, which can drive up costs.\n\nThe economic context of both countries is also important to consider. Mali has a more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector, as well as significant mining and manufacturing industries. Niger, on the other hand, is more dependent on agriculture and natural resources. This diversification can lead to a more stable economy and lower prices in Mali. However, both countries are still developing and face significant challenges, including poverty, corruption, and infrastructure deficits. As a result, the cost of living can vary significantly depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mali (USD) | Niger (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 150 | 200 | 25% more expensive in Niger |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 100 | 150 | 33% more expensive in Niger |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 300 | 400 | 25% more expensive in Niger |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mali (USD) | Niger (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 7 | 28% more expensive in Niger |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 70 | 28% more expensive in Niger |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Niger |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% more expensive in Niger |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mali (USD) | Niger (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Niger |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 1.5 | 33% more expensive in Niger |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1 | 20% more expensive in Niger |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mali (USD) | Niger (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 70 | 28% more expensive in Niger |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive in Niger |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Niger |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mali (USD) | Niger (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 550 | 27% savings in Mali |\n| Mid-Range | 700 | 900 | 22% savings in Mali |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,500 | 20% savings in Mali |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mali is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 25% lower than in Niger\n- Food and dining, with prices up to 28% lower than in Niger\n- Transportation, with prices up to 33% lower than in Niger\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 28% lower than in Niger\n- **Niger is cheaper for:**\n- Some local products, such as fruits and vegetables, which can be up to 10% cheaper than in Mali\n- Traditional clothing and handicrafts, which can be up to 15% cheaper than in Mali\n- Some tourist attractions, which can be up to 10% cheaper than in Mali\n- Local transportation, such as bush taxis, which can be up to 10% cheaper than in Mali\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMali and Niger are both affordable countries, but Mali is generally cheaper. Expats, students, and retirees may find that Mali offers better value for money, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Niger has its own unique charm and attractions, and some visitors may find that the extra cost is worth it for the opportunity to experience the country's rich culture and natural beauty. Families may also find that Niger is a more suitable destination, with a more relaxed pace of life and a stronger sense of community. Ultimately, the choice between Mali and Niger will depend on individual preferences and priorities.
