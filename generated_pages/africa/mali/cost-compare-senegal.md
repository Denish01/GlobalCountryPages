[SECTION] Overview: Mali vs Senegal [/SECTION]
Mali and Senegal are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Mali has a relatively lower cost of living, driven by its lower GDP per capita and lower inflation rate. The country's economy is primarily based on agriculture, with a growing mining sector, which contributes to its lower cost structure. In contrast, Senegal has a more diversified economy, with a stronger service sector and a higher GDP per capita, resulting in a relatively higher cost of living. Overall, Mali offers a more affordable lifestyle, with prices that are approximately 15-20% lower than in Senegal.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Mali has a large informal sector, which contributes to its lower prices, while Senegal has a more formalized economy, with higher labor costs and taxes. Additionally, Senegal's strategic location and proximity to European markets make it a hub for trade and commerce, driving up prices for certain goods and services. In contrast, Mali's landlocked location and limited access to international markets result in lower prices for imported goods. As a result, expats, students, and retirees may find Mali to be a more affordable option, while businesses and investors may prefer Senegal's more developed infrastructure and economy.
