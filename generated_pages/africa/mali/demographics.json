  "content": "The population of Mali is a diverse and growing demographic, with approximately 22.4 million people living in the country, comprising various ethnic groups, languages, and religions.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 22.4 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.9%\nMedian Age: 16.3 years\nUrban Population: 42.4%\nPopulation Density: 18 people per km2\nLife Expectancy: 58.6 years\nFertility Rate: 5.9 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nMali's population size is substantial, considering its land area of approximately 1,240,192 km², making it one of the most populous countries in West Africa. The population growth rate is relatively high, driven by a combination of factors including a high fertility rate and declining mortality rates. Urbanization is also on the rise, with many young people migrating to cities like Bamako, the capital, in search of better economic opportunities. However, this rapid urbanization poses challenges, such as inadequate infrastructure, housing shortages, and strain on public services. Migration patterns in Mali are also influenced by regional and international factors, including the search for employment, education, and security.\n\nThe population of Mali is expected to continue growing, with significant implications for the country's development, economy, and environment. The government and international organizations are working to address the challenges associated with rapid population growth, including improving access to education, healthcare, and family planning services. Furthermore, efforts are being made to promote sustainable development, reduce poverty, and enhance the overall well-being of the population.\n\nMali's population is also characterized by a significant youth bulge, with a large proportion of young people under the age of 25. This demographic trend presents both opportunities and challenges, as young people can drive innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, but also require significant investment in education, skills development, and employment opportunities. The government and other stakeholders are working to harness the potential of this young population, while also addressing the social and economic challenges associated with a rapidly growing youth population.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bambara | 34.1% | Central and southern regions | Largest ethnic group, known for their agricultural skills |\n| Fulani | 14.5% | Northern and central regions | Pastoralist community, with a significant presence in the Sahel region |\n| Soninke | 10.3% | Western and central regions | Known for their trade and commerce networks |\n| Senufo | 8.3% | Southern regions | Agricultural community, with a strong tradition of craftsmanship |\n| Dogon | 4.7% | Central regions | Known for their unique cultural practices and traditions |\n| Tuareg | 3.5% | Northern regions | Nomadic community, with a significant presence in the Sahara desert |\n| Bozo | 2.5% | Central and southern regions | Fishing community, with a strong tradition of boat-building and fishing |\n[/TABLE]\nMali's ethnic diversity is a significant aspect of its cultural identity, with over 20 ethnic groups represented in the country.
