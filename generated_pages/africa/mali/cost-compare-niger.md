[SECTION] Overview: Mali vs Niger [/SECTION]
Mali and Niger are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with similar economic and cultural contexts. However, there are significant differences in their cost of living, with Mali being generally cheaper than Niger. The main reason for this difference is the lower cost of housing, food, and transportation in Mali. Additionally, Mali has a more developed economy and a larger population, which can lead to economies of scale and lower prices. On the other hand, Niger is a smaller and more rural country, with a less developed infrastructure, which can drive up costs.

The economic context of both countries is also important to consider. Mali has a more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector, as well as significant mining and manufacturing industries. Niger, on the other hand, is more dependent on agriculture and natural resources. This diversification can lead to a more stable economy and lower prices in Mali. However, both countries are still developing and face significant challenges, including poverty, corruption, and infrastructure deficits. As a result, the cost of living can vary significantly depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences.
