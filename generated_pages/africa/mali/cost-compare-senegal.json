  "content": "Mali is generally cheaper than Senegal, with a cost of living that is approximately 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMali GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,041\nSenegal GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,544\nMali Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nSenegal Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Mali\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Mali vs Senegal [/SECTION]\nMali and Senegal are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Mali has a relatively lower cost of living, driven by its lower GDP per capita and lower inflation rate. The country's economy is primarily based on agriculture, with a growing mining sector, which contributes to its lower cost structure. In contrast, Senegal has a more diversified economy, with a stronger service sector and a higher GDP per capita, resulting in a relatively higher cost of living. Overall, Mali offers a more affordable lifestyle, with prices that are approximately 15-20% lower than in Senegal.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Mali has a large informal sector, which contributes to its lower prices, while Senegal has a more formalized economy, with higher labor costs and taxes. Additionally, Senegal's strategic location and proximity to European markets make it a hub for trade and commerce, driving up prices for certain goods and services. In contrast, Mali's landlocked location and limited access to international markets result in lower prices for imported goods. As a result, expats, students, and retirees may find Mali to be a more affordable option, while businesses and investors may prefer Senegal's more developed infrastructure and economy.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mali (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mali (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 8 | 37% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 75 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mali (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mali (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mali (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mali is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 33-40% lower than in Senegal\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries that are 33-50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices that are 33-50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with bills that are 33-37% cheaper\n- **Senegal is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, such as electronics and clothing, which are 10-20% cheaper due to its proximity to European markets\n- Healthcare, with higher-quality medical facilities and services that are 10-20% more affordable\n- Education, with a more developed education system and higher-quality schools that are 10-20% more affordable\n- Tourism, with a wider range of tourist attractions and activities that are 10-20% more affordable\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMali offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a cost of living that is approximately 15-20% lower than in Senegal.
