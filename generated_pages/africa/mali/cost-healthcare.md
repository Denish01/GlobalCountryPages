[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Mali's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to overcrowding and long wait times. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. While insurance is not required, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can quickly add up.

The healthcare system in Mali is also divided between urban and rural areas, with cities like Bamako having more advanced medical facilities and specialized care, while rural areas often lack basic medical services. For foreigners, it is essential to have a good understanding of the healthcare system and to have a plan in place for emergency situations. Many private hospitals and clinics in Bamako cater to foreigners and offer high-quality care, but at a cost. It is also worth noting that some medical procedures and treatments may not be available in Mali, and medical evacuation to another country may be necessary in severe cases.
