The system is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education. Primary education is compulsory for 6 years, followed by 3 years of lower secondary education. Public education is generally free or subsidized, but the quality can vary depending on the region and the availability of resources. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a higher cost. International schools are also available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British curriculum.\n\nThe quality of education in Mali is a significant concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure and resources. However, there are efforts being made to improve the education system, including the introduction of new curricula and teacher training programs. For expatriates and international students, there are several options available, including international schools and private institutions. These schools offer a higher quality of education and a range of extracurricular activities, but at a higher cost.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, variable quality |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Range of quality and amenities |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, variable quality |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,000 | Range of quality and amenities |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | IB, British, or American curriculum |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$300 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs and resources |\n| Private University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Range of programs and quality |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | University of Bamako, limited programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$50 | Limited availability |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Variable quality and availability |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | French, English, or local languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic materials and uniforms |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **University of Bamako** is the top-ranked university in Mali, offering a range of programs in French and local languages.\n- **Scholarships** are available for local and international students, but are limited and competitive.\n- **Online learning** options are becoming increasingly available, but are limited by internet access and infrastructure.\n- Education quality in Mali is generally lower than in other West African countries, but is improving with investment and reform efforts.\n- **International schools** are the best option for expatriates and international students, offering a high quality of education and a range of extracurricular activities.\n- **Language skills** are essential for navigating the education system and daily life in Mali, with French being the primary language of instruction.",
