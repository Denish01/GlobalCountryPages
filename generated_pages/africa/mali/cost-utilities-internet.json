The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher prices during the dry season (November to May) due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has implemented measures to improve the utility infrastructure, including investments in renewable energy and water management systems. However, the costs of utilities are still relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Mali varies depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to electricity, water, and sanitation than rural areas. The cost of utilities is also affected by the inflation rate, which was 3.2% in 2024. To mitigate the impact of fluctuating utility costs, households can consider using prepaid electricity meters, which allow them to control their energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | (mostly used for cooking) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in water bill in some areas) |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$90** | **$130** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Orange Mali, Malitel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Orange Mali, Malitel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Orange Mali, Malitel, Telecel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-50 GB | Orange Mali, Malitel, Telecel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-70 | varies | Orange Mali, Malitel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Trace TV, Africa TV) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the providers (e.g. EDM for electricity, SOMAGEP for water) and provide the necessary documents, such as a rental agreement and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity meters can help households control their energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Orange Mali and Malitel are two of the major internet providers in Mali, offering a range of plans and bundles.\n- To save on utility bills, households can consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or carpooling.\n- It is also recommended to regularly check the utility meters and report any issues to the providers to avoid errors in billing.",
