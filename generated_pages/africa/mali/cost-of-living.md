[SECTION] How Expensive Is Mali? [/SECTION]
Mali is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is lower than many other countries in West Africa. The capital city, Bamako, is the most expensive place to live, but even there, prices are relatively low compared to other major cities in the region. Compared to its neighbors, Mali is more expensive than Niger and Burkina Faso, but less expensive than Senegal and Mauritania. Overall, Mali offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expats.

The cost of living in Mali is influenced by the country's economy, which is primarily based on agriculture and mining. The country's currency, the West African CFA franc (XOF), is pegged to the euro, which helps to keep prices stable. However, the cost of living can vary depending on the location, with urban areas like Bamako and Ségou tend to be more expensive than rural areas. Additionally, the cost of living can fluctuate depending on the time of year, with prices tend to be higher during the dry season (November to May) when tourism is at its peak.
