        <h2>How Mali Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Mali is divided into 10 regions, each with its own administrative capital, and a capital district that encompasses the city of Bamako. These regions are further divided into 49 cercles, which are then subdivided into 703 communes. The country's administrative structure is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services, management of natural resources, and promotion of economic development. The regions of Mali are diverse, with varying geography, culture, and economic activities, and each region has its own unique characteristics and challenges.</p>
        <p>The division of Mali into regions is based on a combination of geographical, historical, and cultural factors. The regions are generally grouped into three main categories: the Saharan region in the north, the Sahelian region in the center, and the Sudanian region in the south. Each region has its own distinct identity and plays an important role in the country's overall development. The regional capitals serve as hubs for economic, social, and cultural activities, and are often connected to the capital city of Bamako by road, rail, or air.</p>
