[/SECTION]\nMali is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is lower than many other countries in West Africa.

Overall, Mali offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expats.\n\nThe cost of living in Mali is influenced by the country's economy, which is primarily based on agriculture and mining. The country's currency, the West African CFA franc (XOF), is pegged to the euro, which helps to keep prices stable. However, the cost of living can vary depending on the location, with urban areas like Bamako and Ségou tend to be more expensive than rural areas.
