The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of maintenance being common issues. In the capital city of Bamako, the public transportation system is more developed, with a network of buses and taxis that cover most areas of the city. However, in rural areas, transportation options are limited, and many people rely on **bicycles** or **walking** to get around.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Mali are road-based, with a network of paved and unpaved roads that connect major cities and towns. The country's geography, with the **Niger River** running through it, also makes **river transport** a viable option for cargo and passengers. However, the transportation system is often affected by **potholes**, **traffic congestion**, and **security concerns**, which can make traveling in Mali challenging.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, overcrowding |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Extensive network, variable prices |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Negotiation common |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not widely available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | Fixed price, depending on destination |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.40 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, variable prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Variable prices, depending on route and operator |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes, variable prices |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are often cheaper than metered taxis.\n- When using taxis, it's common to **negotiate the fare** before starting the journey.\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** and **potholes**, which can make traveling in Mali challenging.\n- Consider using **local taxi apps**, which can help you find and book taxis more easily.\n- Always **wear a helmet** when riding a motorcycle or bicycle, as road safety can be a concern in Mali.\n- Be mindful of **security concerns**, particularly when traveling at night or in rural areas.",
