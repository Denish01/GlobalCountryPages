        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Mali, a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in West Africa, has a rich and diverse history. The country's strategic position made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange. The ancient <strong>Ghana Empire</strong>, which flourished from the 4th to the 13th century, was one of the earliest known empires in the region. The <strong>Mali Empire</strong>, which emerged in the 13th century, was another powerful empire that played a significant role in the region's history. The Mali Empire was known for its strong leadership, economic prosperity, and cultural achievements.</p>
        <p>In the 19th century, Mali was colonized by France, and it became a French colony in 1892. The country was then known as <strong>French Sudan</strong>. During the colonial period, Mali's economy and infrastructure were developed, but the country's cultural heritage was also suppressed. On September 22, 1960, Mali gained its independence from France, with <strong>Modibo Keita</strong> as its first president. Since then, the country has experienced periods of stability and instability, with various governments and regimes.</p>
        <p>Mali's historical context is complex and multifaceted. The country has been influenced by various cultures, including African, Arab, and European. The <strong>trans-Saharan trade</strong>, which connected West Africa to the Mediterranean region, played a significant role in shaping the country's economy and culture. The trade also facilitated the spread of <strong>Islam</strong>, which is now the dominant religion in Mali.</p>
        <p>The country's history has also been marked by conflicts and power struggles. The <strong>Tuareg Rebellion</strong>, which began in the 1960s, was a significant conflict that affected the country's stability. The rebellion was led by the <strong>Tuareg people</strong>, who are a nomadic ethnic group that inhabits the Sahara Desert region. The conflict was fueled by issues related to identity, autonomy, and economic marginalization.</p>
