[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
Mali's property market is largely driven by the demand for housing in the capital city, Bamako, where the population is growing rapidly. The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional housing, with a strong focus on **apartment buildings** and **single-family homes**. In recent years, the market has experienced a steady growth in prices, driven by a combination of factors, including government investment in infrastructure and a growing expat community. However, the market is still relatively underdeveloped, and prices can vary significantly depending on the location and type of property.

The urban areas, such as Bamako and Mopti, tend to have a more developed property market, with a wider range of options available, including modern apartments and offices. In contrast, the rural areas are often characterized by traditional housing and a more limited range of options. The price trajectory in Mali's property market is generally upward, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per year. However, the market can be volatile, and prices can fluctuate depending on a range of factors, including economic conditions and government policies.

The Malian government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at stimulating the property market, including the development of new housing estates and the renovation of existing buildings. These initiatives have helped to drive growth in the market, but there are still significant challenges to be addressed, including a lack of infrastructure and a shortage of **financing options**.
