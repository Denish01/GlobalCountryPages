[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Mali is a challenging country to visit, with a range of safety concerns that travelers should be aware of. The country has experienced periods of instability and violence, particularly in the north, where terrorist groups and armed militias operate. However, the capital city Bamako and other major tourist areas are generally considered safer, with a strong police presence and a relatively low risk of violent crime. Despite these challenges, many travelers visit Mali without incident, and with proper planning and precautions, it is possible to have a safe and rewarding experience in this beautiful and culturally rich country.

That being said, travelers should be aware of the potential risks and take necessary precautions to stay safe. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and theft, is common in crowded areas and markets, and scams are also a significant problem. Additionally, the country's healthcare system is limited, and medical facilities may not be up to international standards. Travelers should also be aware of the risk of natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, which can occur in certain parts of the country. With careful planning, a healthy dose of caution, and an understanding of the local culture and customs, travelers can minimize their risk and have a successful trip to Mali.
