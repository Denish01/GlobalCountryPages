[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Mali's healthcare system is characterized by a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare services for the majority of the population. However, the quality of care and access to healthcare facilities and services vary significantly between urban and rural areas. In urban areas like Bamako, there are more healthcare facilities and specialized services available, while in rural areas, access to healthcare is often limited due to a lack of infrastructure, equipment, and trained healthcare professionals. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, including the development of health policies, regulation of healthcare providers, and provision of healthcare services.

The public healthcare system in Mali is generally underfunded and understaffed, which can result in long waiting times, inadequate equipment, and limited access to specialized care. However, there are also private healthcare providers, including clinics and hospitals, which offer higher-quality care and more specialized services, but at a higher cost. These private providers often cater to the wealthy and expatriate communities. Despite the challenges, the Malian government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of **universal health coverage** and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.

Overall, the healthcare system in Mali faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care. However, there are also opportunities for improvement, including the development of private healthcare providers and the introduction of innovative healthcare technologies.
