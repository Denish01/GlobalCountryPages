Mali has a **territorial taxation** system, where individuals and businesses are taxed on their income earned within the country, regardless of their nationality or residence. However, **worldwide taxation** may apply to residents, who are taxed on their global income, with credits available for taxes paid abroad. Residency rules for tax purposes in Mali are based on physical presence, with individuals considered residents if they spend more than 183 days in the country within a calendar year.

The tax system in Mali is administered by the **Direction Générale des Impôts** (DGI), which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax services to individuals and businesses. The DGI has implemented various measures to improve tax compliance, including the introduction of an online tax filing system and the establishment of a tax ombudsman to handle taxpayer complaints.
