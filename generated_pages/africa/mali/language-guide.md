[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Mali is a multilingual country with over 40 languages spoken across its vast territory. French, the official language, is widely used in government, education, and formal settings, but it is not the most widely spoken language in everyday life. Bambara, a **Mande** language, is the most widely spoken language, particularly in the capital city of Bamako and the surrounding areas. Fulfulde, a **Senegambian** language, is also widely spoken, especially in the eastern and northern regions. Songhai, a **Nilo-Saharan** language, is spoken in the northern and central regions. English is not widely spoken, and proficiency is generally low, especially outside of major tourist areas and among younger generations.

The linguistic landscape of Mali is characterized by a high degree of linguistic diversity, with many regional dialects and minority languages. In rural areas, local languages are often the primary means of communication, and French may be less widely spoken. However, in urban areas, particularly in Bamako, French is more widely used, and many Malians speak multiple languages, including French, Bambara, and other local languages.

Despite the low English proficiency, many Malians, particularly in the tourism industry, are making an effort to learn English to cater to the growing number of international visitors. However, it is still essential for visitors to learn some basic French and local phrases to communicate effectively and show respect for the local culture.
