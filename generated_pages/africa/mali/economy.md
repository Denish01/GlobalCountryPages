[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Mali's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with the majority of the population engaged in subsistence farming. As a low-income economy, Mali faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and limited access to basic services such as healthcare and education. The country has made progress in recent years, with economic growth averaging around 5% per annum, driven by a combination of factors including gold mining, cotton production, and foreign investment. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and climate-related disruptions to agricultural production.

Mali's economic classification as a low-income country reflects its limited economic development and low standard of living. The country has a large informal sector, with many people engaged in small-scale trading and subsistence farming. The government has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting economic development, including investments in infrastructure and efforts to diversify the economy. Despite these efforts, significant challenges remain, including a lack of access to finance and limited economic opportunities for many Malians.

The Malian economy has experienced a significant trajectory in recent years, with the country emerging from a period of conflict and instability. The government has made efforts to promote economic stability and attract foreign investment, including the establishment of a new investment code and the creation of a number of special economic zones. However, the economy remains heavily reliant on external aid, and the country faces significant challenges in terms of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable economic development.
