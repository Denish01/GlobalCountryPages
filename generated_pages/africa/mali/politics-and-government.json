  "content": "Mali is governed as a **unitary semi-presidential republic**, with a system that combines elements of presidential and parliamentary systems, where the President serves as the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Semi-Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President, currently Assimi Goïta\nHead of Government: Prime Minister, currently Choguel Kokalla Maïga\nLegislature: National Assembly, unicameral with 147 seats\nLegal System: Civil law, based on French law and traditional law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 143 out of 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index, indicating a high level of instability\nCorruption Index: Ranked 136 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating a significant level of corruption\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Mali is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and serves as the head of state. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, to oversee the implementation of government policies. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, a unicameral body with 147 seats, where members are elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court, which interpret the laws and ensure their conformity with the constitution.\n\nThe system of government in Mali is designed to provide a balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the others. However, in practice, the **separation of powers** has been challenged by the military's influence in politics, particularly since the 2020 military coup that ousted the democratically elected government. The country's **federal structure** is unitary, with a centralized government and eight regions, each with a governor and a regional assembly.\n\nThe political system in Mali is also characterized by a **multiparty system**, with numerous parties competing for power and representation in the National Assembly. However, the **dominant party** has historically been the Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA), which has produced several presidents and prime ministers. The **opposition parties** have often been fragmented and weakened by internal divisions, making it difficult for them to mount an effective challenge to the ruling party.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Assimi Goïta | Head of State, Commander-in-Chief |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maïga | Head of Government, oversees policy implementation |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | President of the National Assembly, currently Mady Doumbia | Lawmaking, oversight of the executive |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court, currently Bouaré Fily Dabo | Interpretation of laws, ensures conformity with the constitution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA) | Center-left | Tiébilé Dramé | 44 | Dominant party, produced several presidents and prime ministers |\n| Rassemblement pour le Mali (RPM) | Center-right | Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta | 38 | Former ruling party, lost power in 2020 coup |\n| Union pour la République et la Démocratie (URD) | Center | Youssouf Traoré | 17 | Opposition party, advocate for democratic reforms |\n| Parti pour la Renaissance Nationale (PARENA) | Center-left | Tiecoura Traoré | 12 | Opposition party, emphasizes social justice and equality |\n| Convention Nationale pour une Afrique Solidaire (CNAS) | Left-wing | Oumar Mariko | 6 | Opposition party, advocates for social and economic reforms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Mali is based on **proportional representation**, with voters electing members to the National Assembly for a five-year term.\n- Presidential elections are held every five years, with the President elected by **direct universal suffrage**.\n- The last presidential election was held in 2018, with Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta winning the election, but was ousted in the 2020 military coup.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled for 2024, but the date has not been confirmed due to the ongoing political instability.\n- Voter participation in Mali's elections has been relatively low, with an average turnout of around 40% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Mali's political climate is currently unstable, with the country facing numerous challenges, including **jihadist insurgency**, **corruption**, and **poverty**.\n- The country has been plagued by **terrorist attacks**, particularly in the northern regions, which have caused significant human suffering and displacement.\n- The **military coup** in 2020 has also created a power vacuum, with the transitional government struggling to assert its authority and implement reforms.\n- The **regional dynamics** are also complex, with Mali being a key player in the Sahel region, and the country's stability having implications for the entire region.\n- Mali's **freedom indices** are low, with the country ranking 135 out of 180 countries in the 2022 World Press Freedom Index, and 143 out of 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Mali is a member of several international organizations, including the **United Nations**, the **African Union**, and the **Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)**.\n- The country has a **strategic partnership** with France, which provides significant economic and military aid to Mali.\n- Mali also has **diplomatic relations** with several other countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, and has been seeking to diversify its international partnerships.\n- The country is a **key player** in regional organizations, such as the **Sahel Alliance**, which aims to promote economic development and security cooperation in the Sahel region.\n- Mali's **diplomatic stance** is generally **pro-Western**, but the country has also been seeking to strengthen its ties with other regions, including the **Middle East** and **Asia**.",
