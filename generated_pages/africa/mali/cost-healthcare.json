  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Mali can vary significantly depending on the type of care and provider, with public services generally being more affordable but often overcrowded and under-resourced, while private facilities offer better quality care at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $34 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 47.2% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 15 or 18\nInsurance Required: No\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMali's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to overcrowding and long wait times. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. While insurance is not required, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can quickly add up.\n\nThe healthcare system in Mali is also divided between urban and rural areas, with cities like Bamako having more advanced medical facilities and specialized care, while rural areas often lack basic medical services. For foreigners, it is essential to have a good understanding of the healthcare system and to have a plan in place for emergency situations. Many private hospitals and clinics in Bamako cater to foreigners and offer high-quality care, but at a cost. It is also worth noting that some medical procedures and treatments may not be available in Mali, and medical evacuation to another country may be necessary in severe cases.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Public hospitals often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Specialists may only be available in private clinics |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-70 | Private dental clinics offer better equipment and care |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-50 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $30-50 | Private labs may offer faster results and more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-100 | Private hospitals may have more advanced equipment and staff |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-200 | Private hospitals often have better amenities and care |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-500 | More complex surgeries may require medical evacuation |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-300 | Private clinics may offer more personalized care and amenities |\n| MRI Scan | $200-500 | MRI scans may only be available in private clinics |\n| X-Ray | $20-50 | X-rays are widely available in both public and private facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Public hospital care, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-300 | Private hospital care, specialist consultations, more comprehensive medical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-500 | Emergency medical evacuation, international hospital care, comprehensive medical procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications like **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** are widely available in pharmacies and can cost between $5-20.\n- **Prescription medications** may require a doctor's note and can be more expensive, with prices ranging from $20-100.\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but it is essential to check the expiration dates and authenticity of the products.\n- Some medications may be counterfeit or of poor quality, so it is crucial to purchase from reputable pharmacies.\n- Pharmacies in private hospitals and clinics may offer a wider range of medications and better quality products.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 15 or 18, or to seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. While public hospitals may have limited resources and equipment, they can provide basic emergency care. Private hospitals and clinics, on the other hand, may have more advanced equipment and staff, but may require payment upfront. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest private hospital and having a means of payment. The **Point G Hospital** in Bamako is a well-equipped private hospital that offers emergency care and is popular among foreigners.\n\nFor severe medical emergencies, medical evacuation to another country may be necessary. It is essential to have a good understanding of the emergency services available and to have a plan in place for emergency situations. Many private hospitals and clinics in Bamako have partnerships with international medical evacuation services, and some insurance providers also offer emergency medical evacuation coverage. In case of an emergency, it is crucial to stay calm and to seek medical attention immediately.
