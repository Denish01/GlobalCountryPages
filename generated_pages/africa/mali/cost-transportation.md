[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Mali has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **minibuses**, **taxis**, and **motorcycles** to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of maintenance being common issues. In the capital city of Bamako, the public transportation system is more developed, with a network of buses and taxis that cover most areas of the city. However, in rural areas, transportation options are limited, and many people rely on **bicycles** or **walking** to get around.

The main transportation modes in Mali are road-based, with a network of paved and unpaved roads that connect major cities and towns. The country's geography, with the **Niger River** running through it, also makes **river transport** a viable option for cargo and passengers. However, the transportation system is often affected by **potholes**, **traffic congestion**, and **security concerns**, which can make traveling in Mali challenging.
