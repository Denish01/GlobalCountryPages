# The Truth About Gambia - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Gambia, officially known as the Republic of The Gambia, is a sovereign country located in West Africa. The country has a rich and diverse history, with various empires and colonial powers vying for control over the region. The earliest known inhabitants of Gambia were the **Serer** and **Wolof** peoples, who migrated to the area from present-day Senegal. In the 13th century, Gambia became part of the **Mali Empire**, a powerful and influential empire that controlled much of West Africa.

In the 15th century, European explorers, including the Portuguese, began to arrive in Gambia. The Portuguese established trade relations with the local population and built forts and trading posts along the coast. In 1816, the British established a colony in Gambia, which became a British protectorate in 1894. Gambia remained a British colony until it gained independence on February 18, 1965. The country became a republic in 1970, with **Sir Dawda Jawara** as its first president.

Gambia's independence was marked by a period of stability and economic growth, with the country becoming a popular tourist destination. However, in 1994, a military coup led by **Yahya Jammeh** overthrew the government, and Jammeh ruled the country until 2017. In 2017, **Adama Barrow** was elected president, marking a new era of democracy and stability in Gambia.

Gambia's history has been shaped by its strategic location on the West African coast, with the country serving as an important hub for trade and commerce. The country's economy has historically been driven by agriculture, with **groundnuts** (peanuts) being a major crop. Today, Gambia is a member of the **Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)** and the **African Union**, and is working to diversify its economy and develop its tourism and manufacturing sectors.
