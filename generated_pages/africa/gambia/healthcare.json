  "content": "Healthcare in Gambia is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services, although the quality of care and access to facilities can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 116\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Gambia is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by community health centers and health posts, while secondary care is offered by regional hospitals and health centers. Tertiary care is available at the country's main referral hospital, the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital in Banjul. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, although private providers are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the expatriate community and those who can afford to pay out-of-pocket. The quality of care in Gambia is generally considered to be lower than in developed countries, with limited resources, equipment, and trained personnel, particularly in rural areas.\n\nAccess to healthcare in Gambia is also a significant challenge, particularly in rural areas where facilities and personnel are scarce. Urban areas, such as Banjul and Kanifing, have better access to healthcare services, including private clinics and hospitals. However, even in these areas, the quality of care can be variable, and patients may need to pay out-of-pocket for services or travel to neighboring countries for specialized care. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the expansion of community-based healthcare services.\n\nDespite these efforts, significant challenges remain, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care. As a result, many Gambians travel to neighboring countries, such as Senegal or Guinea, for medical treatment, or seek care from traditional healers or unqualified practitioners. The country's healthcare system is also heavily reliant on donor funding and support from international organizations, which can create sustainability challenges and limit the government's ability to respond to emerging health needs.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Edward

evacuation to a nearby country if necessary.\n- The Gambian government has introduced a national health insurance scheme, which provides coverage for citizens and residents, although the scope and quality of coverage can vary.\n- Private health insurance options are available, including international companies such as Bupa and Allianz, although these can be expensive and may not be widely accepted by local providers.\n- Some employers, particularly in the private sector, may offer health insurance as a benefit to their employees, although this is not always the case.\n- The cost of

necessary.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Pharmacies are available in urban areas, such as Banjul and Kanifing, although the range of medications and quality of services can vary.\n- Prescription medications are generally available, although there may be shortages of certain medications, particularly in rural areas.\n- Common brands of medications, such as painkillers and

significant risk to health.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- Yellow fever vaccination is required for all travelers to Gambia, although other vaccinations, such as hepatitis A and typhoid, are also recommended.\n- Malaria is a significant health risk in Gambia, particularly during the rainy season, and travelers should take precautions, such as using insecticide-treated bed nets and wearing protective clothing.\n- Other health risks in Gambia include diarrhea and dysentery, which can be caused by contaminated food and water, as well as respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis.\n- Travelers should take precautions to avoid insect bites, such as using insect repellents and wearing protective clothing, as well as avoiding contact with animals, which can transmit diseases such as rabies.\n- The quality of water in Gambia can be a concern, particularly in rural areas, and travelers should take precautions, such as using water filters or boiling water before drinking it.\n- Food safety is also a concern, particularly when eating from street vendors or markets, and travelers should take precautions, such as avoiding undercooked meat and raw vegetables.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Gambia is not a significant destination for medical tourism, although some private clinics and hospitals may offer specialized services, such as dental care or cosmetic surgery.\n- The country's limited infrastructure and resources, as well as the risk of infectious diseases, such as malaria, make it a less attractive destination for medical tourists.\n- However, some private clinics and hospitals may offer specialized services, such as fertility treatment or orthopedic surgery, which can be more affordable than in developed countries.\n- Patients should carefully research and evaluate the qualifications and experience of healthcare providers, as well as the quality of care and facilities, before seeking medical treatment in Gambia.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a medical emergency, patients should call the emergency number, 116, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- Ambulance services are available, although they may be limited, particularly in rural areas, and patients may need to rely on private transportation or taxis to reach a hospital.\n- Patients should have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuation, such as a private insurance policy or a medical evacuation service, in case they need to be transported to a nearby country for specialized care.\n- Patients should also be aware of the nearest hospital or clinic, as well as the quality of care and services available, in order to make informed decisions about their medical treatment.\n- In the event of a medical emergency, patients should remain calm and seek immediate attention, as delays in seeking treatment can significantly impact outcomes and increase the risk of complications.",
