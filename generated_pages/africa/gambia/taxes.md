[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Gambia has a **territorial tax system**, which means that individuals and businesses are taxed only on their Gambia-sourced income. However, residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. To be considered a tax resident in Gambia, an individual must have a permanent home in the country, spend more than 183 days in a calendar year in Gambia, or have a home and family in the country. The tax year in Gambia runs from January to December, and taxpayers must file their returns by June 30th of the following year.

The Gambia tax system is designed to promote economic growth and development, with a range of incentives and exemptions available to encourage investment and entrepreneurship. The government has also implemented measures to improve tax compliance and reduce tax evasion, including the introduction of a new tax law and the establishment of a tax tribunal. Despite these efforts, the tax system in Gambia can be complex, and taxpayers are advised to seek professional advice to ensure they are meeting their tax obligations.
