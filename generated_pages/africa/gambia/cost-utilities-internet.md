[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Gambia's utility infrastructure is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the dry season (November to June) leading to increased prices. The government has been working to improve the infrastructure, but the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location. In general, the cost of utilities in Gambia is relatively high compared to other African countries, due to the country's reliance on imported fuel and limited resources.

The stability of utility costs in Gambia is a concern, as prices can change frequently due to factors such as fuel price fluctuations and currency exchange rates. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive utility regulatory framework can lead to inconsistent pricing and service quality. However, some utility companies are working to improve their services and offer more competitive pricing, which can help to reduce the burden on consumers.
