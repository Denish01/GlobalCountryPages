[SECTION] How Gambia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Gambia is divided into 8 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and the Banjul City Council. The LGAs are further divided into districts, which are then subdivided into wards. The country's administrative structure is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. The division of the country into smaller administrative units also allows for more effective governance and decision-making at the local level.

The 8 LGAs in Gambia are Brikama, Janjanbureh, Kanifing, Kerewan, Kuntaur, Mansakonko, Basse, and West Coast Region. Each LGA has its own council, which is responsible for overseeing the delivery of public services and implementing development projects in the area. The Banjul City Council, on the other hand, is responsible for governing the capital city and providing municipal services to its residents.
