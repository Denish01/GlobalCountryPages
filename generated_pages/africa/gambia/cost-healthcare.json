  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Gambia can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private facilities, with public healthcare services being generally more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources, while private facilities offer better care but at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $26 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 33.8% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 116\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: GMD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGambia has a mixed healthcare system, which includes both public and private facilities. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in limited access to quality medical care, especially in rural areas. Locals often rely on public healthcare facilities, but foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private facilities, which offer better care and more modern equipment. The healthcare system is not universal, and many Gambians lack health insurance, relying on out-of-pocket payments for medical services. As a result, many people, especially in rural areas, have limited access to healthcare, and the country struggles with high rates of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.\n\nThe healthcare system in Gambia is also affected by a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country in search of better opportunities abroad. This has resulted in a significant gap in the provision of healthcare services, especially in specialized areas such as surgery and obstetrics. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the establishment of new hospitals and health centers, and the introduction of programs to train more healthcare professionals. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have long wait times and limited resources |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private clinics offer more specialized care, but at a higher cost |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Dental care is limited in public facilities, and many people opt for private clinics |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Eye care is also limited in public facilities, and many people opt for private clinics |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Laboratory tests are often more expensive in private facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have limited emergency services, and private clinics are more expensive |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable and better-equipped facilities, but at a higher cost |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Surgical procedures are often more expensive in private facilities, but the quality of care is generally better |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$200 | Maternity care is often limited in public facilities, and many women opt for private clinics |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Diagnostic tests such as MRI scans are often only available in private facilities |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | X-rays are more widely available, but the quality of the equipment may vary |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$30 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays, but often has limited coverage and high deductibles |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Offers more comprehensive coverage, including specialist consultations, surgical procedures, and diagnostic tests, but is often more expensive |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Provides comprehensive coverage, including emergency evacuations and repatriations, and is often required for foreigners living and working in Gambia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available in pharmacies and markets, but the quality and authenticity of these medications can vary.\n- Prescription medication is often more expensive than over-the-counter medication, and may require a doctor's prescription.\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, but the quality and safety of these medications can vary.\n- Medication prices can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location, with prices often being higher in private clinics and lower in public hospitals.\n- It is recommended to purchase medication from reputable pharmacies and to always check the expiration dates and packaging of medications.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 116 or to seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.
