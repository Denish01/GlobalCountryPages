The President is directly elected by the people and serves a five-year term. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Constitution, which provides checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the others. Gambia is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and no federal or regional entities with significant autonomy.\n\nThe National Assembly, the country's unicameral legislature, is composed of 58 members who are elected by the people for a five-year term. The Assembly is responsible for making laws, approving the budget, and exercising oversight over the executive branch. The **principle of parliamentary supremacy** is not applicable in Gambia, as the Constitution provides for a presidential system with a strong executive.\n\nGambia's political system is also characterized by a **multi-party system**, with several parties competing for power. The country has a long history of democratic governance, with regular elections and a relatively stable political environment. However, the country has faced challenges in the past, including a **military coup** in 1994 and a **presidential election crisis** in 2016.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President Adama Barrow | Head of state and government, commander-in-chief of the armed forces |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker Fabakary Tombong Jatta | Lawmaking, budget approval, oversight over the executive |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice Hassan B.
