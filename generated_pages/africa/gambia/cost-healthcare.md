[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Gambia has a mixed healthcare system, which includes both public and private facilities. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in limited access to quality medical care, especially in rural areas. Locals often rely on public healthcare facilities, but foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private facilities, which offer better care and more modern equipment. The healthcare system is not universal, and many Gambians lack health insurance, relying on out-of-pocket payments for medical services. As a result, many people, especially in rural areas, have limited access to healthcare, and the country struggles with high rates of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.

The healthcare system in Gambia is also affected by a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country in search of better opportunities abroad. This has resulted in a significant gap in the provision of healthcare services, especially in specialized areas such as surgery and obstetrics. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the establishment of new hospitals and health centers, and the introduction of programs to train more healthcare professionals. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country.

- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, but the quality and safety of these medications can vary.
- Medication prices can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location, with prices often being higher in private clinics and lower in public hospitals.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 116 or to seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are limited, and it may be necessary to use a taxi or private vehicle to transport the patient to the hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private facilities, such as the Africmed Hospital or the Fajara Clinic, which offer better care and more modern equipment. However, these facilities can be expensive, and it is recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations and repatriations. It is also recommended to research the local healthcare system and to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of transportation available.
