  "content": "The infrastructure in Gambia is relatively underdeveloped, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas, but the country has made efforts to improve its roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors in recent years.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 57% of population\nInternet Penetration: 19%\nRoad Network: 3,740 km, moderate quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nGambia's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and clean water. The government has implemented several initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural infrastructure and the expansion of access to energy and telecommunications.\n\nDespite these efforts, Gambia's infrastructure remains a significant challenge to the country's economic development. The lack of reliable energy, transportation, and telecommunications infrastructure can make it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently, and can also limit access to basic services such as healthcare and education. The government has recognized the importance of infrastructure development and has made it a priority area for investment and reform.\n\nThe urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge in Gambia. While urban areas such as Banjul and Kanifing have relatively well-developed infrastructure, rural areas often lack access to basic services such as roads, electricity, and clean water. This can make it difficult for people in rural areas to access basic services, and can also limit economic opportunities and development in these areas.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 3,740 km | Moderate | Major roads are generally in good condition, but rural roads can be poor |\n| Railways | none | - | Gambia has no rail network |\n| Airports | 1 international, several domestic | Good | The international airport in Banjul is well-maintained, but domestic airports can be basic |\n| Ports | 1 major | Good | The port in Banjul is a major hub for trade and commerce |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Gambia's energy sector is dominated by diesel generators, which provide the majority of the country's electricity\n- The country has made efforts to increase access to energy, with a goal of reaching 100% electrification by 2025\n- Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly important in Gambia's energy mix\n- The country has implemented a number of initiatives to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy costs\n- Gambia has also made efforts to improve the reliability of its energy supply, with a goal of reducing power outages and improving the overall quality of service\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to clean water is a significant challenge in Gambia, particularly in rural areas\n- The country has made efforts to improve access to water and sanitation, with a goal of reaching 100% coverage by 2025\n- Tap water is generally not safe to drink, and many people rely on wells or other alternative sources of water\n- Sanitation coverage is also limited, particularly in rural areas, where many people lack access to basic sanitation facilities\n- The government has implemented a number of initiatives to improve access to water and sanitation, including the development of new water treatment plants and the expansion of sanitation services\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Gambia's telecommunications sector has experienced significant growth in recent years, with mobile phone penetration increasing rapidly\n- The country has a relatively well-developed mobile network, with coverage available in most areas\n- Fiber optic cables have been installed in some areas, providing high-speed internet access\n- The government has implemented a number of initiatives to improve access to telecommunications, including the development of new mobile phone networks and the expansion of internet services\n- Gambia's postal service is relatively well-developed, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services available throughout the country\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government of Gambia has launched a number of major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the energy sector\n- The country has also received funding from international organizations such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank to support infrastructure development\n- One of the major ongoing projects is the development of a new international airport, which is expected to be completed in the near future\n- The government has also announced plans to develop a new port facility, which will increase the country's capacity for trade and commerce\n- The European Union has provided funding for a number of infrastructure development projects in Gambia, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the energy sector.",
