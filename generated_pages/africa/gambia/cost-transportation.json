  "content": "The cost of transportation in Gambia can vary greatly depending on the mode of transport, with a monthly transit pass costing around $10 USD and a taxi start rate of $1.50 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($10 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($1.50 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.20 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (Yes — apps like Allo Taxi and Gambia Ride)\nCurrency: GMD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nGambia has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit is limited, with few options available, especially outside of the capital city Banjul. However, the country's small size and relatively low population density make it easy to navigate, and many people opt to walk or cycle for short journeys. The main transportation modes in Gambia are **buses**, **taxis**, and **ferries**, which connect the capital city to other parts of the country.\n\nThe lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in Gambia means that many people rely on informal transportation options, such as **shared taxis** and **minibuses**, which can be affordable but may not always be safe or reliable. Despite these challenges, the country's transportation network is slowly improving, with investments in new roads and transportation infrastructure. However, the high **inflation rate** of 11.6% in 2024 can affect the cost of transportation, making it essential to plan and budget accordingly.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $10 | Limited coverage, mostly in Banjul |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00 | N/A | Connects Banjul to other towns and villages |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Available in Banjul |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Allo Taxi and Gambia Ride |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Banjul city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, including fuel |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Rarely used, mostly for long-distance travel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Banjul to other major towns |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Limited domestic flights, mostly to the coast |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis** instead of private taxis.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like **Allo Taxi** and **Gambia Ride** to book taxis in advance and avoid haggling over prices.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a taxi, especially if you're not using a metered taxi.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for long-distance travel, as it can be more convenient and cost-effective than using public transportation.\n- Be prepared for **traffic congestion** and delays, especially during peak hours or in rural areas.",
