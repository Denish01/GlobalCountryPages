[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Gambia's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and clean water. The government has implemented several initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural infrastructure and the expansion of access to energy and telecommunications.

Despite these efforts, Gambia's infrastructure remains a significant challenge to the country's economic development. The lack of reliable energy, transportation, and telecommunications infrastructure can make it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently, and can also limit access to basic services such as healthcare and education. The government has recognized the importance of infrastructure development and has made it a priority area for investment and reform.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge in Gambia. While urban areas such as Banjul and Kanifing have relatively well-developed infrastructure, rural areas often lack access to basic services such as roads, electricity, and clean water. This can make it difficult for people in rural areas to access basic services, and can also limit economic opportunities and development in these areas.
