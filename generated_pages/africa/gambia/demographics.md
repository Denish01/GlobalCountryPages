The urban population is concentrated in the capital city of Banjul and other major cities, such as Serekunda and Brikama.

The population of Gambia is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the country and to other countries in the region. Many Gambians migrate to neighboring countries, such as Senegal and Guinea, in search of better economic opportunities. The country is also a popular destination for tourists, with many visitors drawn to its beautiful beaches, vibrant culture, and rich history. Despite its small size, Gambia has a significant impact on the regional economy, with a growing trade sector and a strategic location on the West African coast.

The population of Gambia is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and a declining mortality rate. The country will need to invest in education, healthcare, and infrastructure to support its growing population and ensure that it can provide for the needs of its citizens. This will require careful planning and management, as well as international cooperation and support.
