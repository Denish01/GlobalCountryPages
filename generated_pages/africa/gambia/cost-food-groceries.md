[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Gambia are generally lower compared to the regional average, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant costing around $3-$5 USD. However, the country's reliance on imported goods and the high inflation rate of 11.6% can drive up prices. The eating-out culture in Gambia is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals opting to cook at home using traditional ingredients such as **rice**, **peanuts**, and **fish**. This is due in part to the relatively low cost of groceries, with a kilogram of rice costing around $1-$2 USD.

The cost of food in Gambia can vary depending on the location, with urban areas such as Banjul and Serrekunda tend to have higher prices than rural areas. Additionally, the country's **tourist season**, which runs from November to April, can also impact food prices, with many restaurants and hotels increasing their prices during this time. Despite these factors, Gambia remains a relatively affordable destination for food, with a wide range of traditional and international cuisine available.
