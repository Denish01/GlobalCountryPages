[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Gambia is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by community health centers and health posts, while secondary care is offered by regional hospitals and health centers. Tertiary care is available at the country's main referral hospital, the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital in Banjul. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, although private providers are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the expatriate community and those who can afford to pay out-of-pocket. The quality of care in Gambia is generally considered to be lower than in developed countries, with limited resources, equipment, and trained personnel, particularly in rural areas.

Access to healthcare in Gambia is also a significant challenge, particularly in rural areas where facilities and personnel are scarce. Urban areas, such as Banjul and Kanifing, have better access to healthcare services, including private clinics and hospitals. However, even in these areas, the quality of care can be variable, and patients may need to pay out-of-pocket for services or travel to neighboring countries for specialized care. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the expansion of community-based healthcare services.

Despite these efforts, significant challenges remain, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care. As a result, many Gambians travel to neighboring countries, such as Senegal or Guinea, for medical treatment, or seek care from traditional healers or unqualified practitioners. The country's healthcare system is also heavily reliant on donor funding and support from international organizations, which can create sustainability challenges and limit the government's ability to respond to emerging health needs.
