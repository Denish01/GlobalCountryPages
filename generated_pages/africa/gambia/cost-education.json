  "content": "The cost of education in Gambia varies depending on the type of institution, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools and international institutions charge tuition fees ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 2.8%\nLiteracy Rate: 55%\nSchool System: 9 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: GMD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Gambia is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being generally free or subsidized. However, the quality of public education can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to offer higher-quality education, but at a cost. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 9 years, from primary to junior secondary school. International schools are also available, catering to expatriate families and offering curricula such as the British or American systems.\n\nThe Gambian education system faces challenges such as limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education sector, including increasing access to education and implementing programs to improve teacher training and curriculum development. Private schools and international institutions have also played a significant role in providing high-quality education, especially for those who can afford it. However, the cost of attending these institutions can be prohibitively expensive for many Gambian families, highlighting the need for more affordable and accessible education options.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$50 | Free or subsidized, variable quality |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Range by tier, from basic to high-end |\n| Public Secondary | $50-$100 | Free or subsidized, variable quality |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,000 | Range by tier, from basic to high-end |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Curriculum types include British, American, and IB |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | University of The Gambia |\n| Private University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Range by institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | University of The Gambia, faculty of medicine |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$50 | Range by provider and quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Range by subject and tutor qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | Range by language and provider |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Range by school and grade level |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Range by school and quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The University of The Gambia is the top-ranked institution in the country, offering a range of undergraduate and graduate programs.\n- Expatriate families often opt for international schools, which offer high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- Scholarships are available for Gambian students, particularly for those pursuing higher education or vocational training.\n- Online learning options are limited in Gambia, but some institutions offer distance learning programs or online courses.\n- Education quality in Gambia is generally lower compared to regional standards, but efforts are being made to improve the sector.\n- **English language proficiency** is highly valued in Gambia, and language courses are available for those seeking to improve their skills.",
