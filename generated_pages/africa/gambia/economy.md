[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Gambia is a low-income economy with a fragile economic structure, heavily reliant on agriculture, services, and remittances from abroad. The country's economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, driven by a combination of factors including agricultural production, tourism, and foreign investment. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events. Gambia's economic development level is still in its early stages, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line.

The country's economic trajectory is closely tied to its strategic location on the West African coast, with a growing tourism sector and a budding manufacturing industry. However, the economy faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate, particularly among young people, and a lack of economic diversification. The government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including investments in infrastructure and efforts to attract foreign investment.

Despite these challenges, Gambia has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average annual rate of 3-4%. The country has also made efforts to improve its business environment, with a focus on simplifying regulatory procedures and reducing bureaucratic hurdles. However, more needs to be done to address the country's deep-seated economic challenges and promote sustainable economic growth.

The government is also working to improve the country's investment climate, including through the establishment of a new investment promotion agency.
