The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the dry season (November to June) leading to increased prices. The government has been working to improve the infrastructure, but the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location. In general, the cost of utilities in Gambia is relatively high compared to other African countries, due to the country's reliance on imported fuel and limited resources.\n\nThe stability of utility costs in Gambia is a concern, as prices can change frequently due to factors such as fuel price fluctuations and currency exchange rates. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive utility regulatory framework can lead to inconsistent pricing and service quality. However, some utility companies are working to improve their services and offer more competitive pricing, which can help to reduce the burden on consumers.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in rent or separate fee |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Gamtel, QCell |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 60-100 Mbps | Gamtel, QCell |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | QCell, Africell |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-50 GB | QCell, Africell |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Gamtel, QCell |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in Gambia |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Gambia |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited options available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Gambia, it's recommended to work with a local real estate agent or property manager to ensure a smooth process.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help consumers manage their energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Gamtel and QCell are two of the main internet service providers in Gambia, offering a range of plans and packages.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with your landlord or property manager to include utility costs in your rent, which can help to simplify your expenses and avoid unexpected bills.",
