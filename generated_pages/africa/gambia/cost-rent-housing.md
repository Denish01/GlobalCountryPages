[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Gambia's rental market is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract and to understand the terms and conditions before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Senegal, Gambia's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to relocate to the region. However, the housing market can be challenging to navigate, especially for foreigners, and it is recommended to work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager.

The housing market in Gambia is also influenced by the country's growing tourism industry, with many properties being rented out to tourists on a short-term basis. This has led to an increase in demand for rental properties, particularly in areas such as Kotu and Kololi, which are popular with tourists. However, for those looking for long-term rentals, there are still many options available, including apartments, houses, and compounds. It is essential to research the area and the property thoroughly before making a decision, and to consider factors such as proximity to amenities, transportation, and security.
