[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Gambia is a tropical country located in West Africa, with a climate that is characterized by a dry season and a wet season. The dry season, which runs from November to June, is the best time to visit Gambia, as the weather is dry and sunny, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 30°C. The wet season, which runs from July to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. The country's climate is divided into two main zones: the coastal zone, which is cooler and more humid, and the inland zone, which is hotter and drier. The dry season is the best time to visit Gambia's beaches, national parks, and wildlife reserves, as the weather is pleasant and the risk of malaria is lower.

The wet season, on the other hand, is not ideal for outdoor activities, as the heavy rainfall and high humidity can make it difficult to explore the country's natural beauty. However, the wet season is the best time to see Gambia's lush vegetation and green landscapes, as the rainfall brings new life to the country's flora. The wet season is also the best time to see the country's wildlife, as the animals are more active during this time.

Gambia's climate is also influenced by its geographical location, with the coastal zone being more prone to sea breezes and cooler temperatures. The inland zone, on the other hand, is hotter and drier, with temperatures often reaching 40°C during the dry season. The country's climate is also affected by the **harmattan**, a dry wind that blows from the Sahara Desert during the dry season, bringing dry and dusty air to the country.
