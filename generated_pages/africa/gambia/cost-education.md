[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Gambia is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being generally free or subsidized. However, the quality of public education can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to offer higher-quality education, but at a cost. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 9 years, from primary to junior secondary school. International schools are also available, catering to expatriate families and offering curricula such as the British or American systems.

The Gambian education system faces challenges such as limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education sector, including increasing access to education and implementing programs to improve teacher training and curriculum development. Private schools and international institutions have also played a significant role in providing high-quality education, especially for those who can afford it. However, the cost of attending these institutions can be prohibitively expensive for many Gambian families, highlighting the need for more affordable and accessible education options.
