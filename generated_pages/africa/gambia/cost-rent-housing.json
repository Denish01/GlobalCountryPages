Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract and to understand the terms and conditions before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Senegal, Gambia's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to relocate to the region. However, the housing market can be challenging to navigate, especially for foreigners, and it is recommended to work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager.\n\nThe housing market in Gambia is also influenced by the country's growing tourism industry, with many properties being rented out to tourists on a short-term basis. This has led to an increase in demand for rental properties, particularly in areas such as Kotu and Kololi, which are popular with tourists. However, for those looking for long-term rentals, there are still many options available, including apartments, houses, and compounds. It is essential to research the area and the property thoroughly before making a decision, and to consider factors such as proximity to amenities, transportation, and security.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $80-$200 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $100-$250 | Standard amenities, self-contained |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$600 | $200-$400 | Family size, modern amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$1,000 | $350-$700 | Spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,000-$2,000 | Prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $500-$1,500 | Residential areas, standard amenities |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | Traditional villages, basic amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Kotu**: A popular area with tourists and expats, known for its beautiful beaches and modern amenities, with rent ranges from $200-$500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Kololi**: A bustling area with a wide range of shops, restaurants, and bars, with rent ranges from $250-$600 per month for a two-bedroom apartment.\n- **Fajara**: A quiet and residential area, popular with families and those looking for a more relaxed lifestyle, with rent ranges from $150-$300 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Banjul**: The capital city, with a wide range of accommodation options, including apartments and houses, with rent ranges from $100-$400 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Bakau**: A coastal town with a beautiful beach and a range of amenities, with rent ranges from $200-$500 per month for a two-bedroom apartment.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Gambia [/SECTION]\n- Research the area thoroughly before making a decision, considering factors such as proximity to amenities, transportation, and security.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable property.\n- Always inspect the property before signing a lease, and take photos and notes to document the condition.\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, and ensure that you understand the contract before signing.\n- Be aware of scams and fraudulent activities, and never pay a deposit or rent without a written contract.\n- Consider factors such as utilities, furniture, and maintenance when calculating the total cost of renting a property.",
