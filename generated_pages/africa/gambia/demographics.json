The country has a high population growth rate, with an average annual increase of 3.1%, which is one of the highest in the region. This growth rate is driven by a high total fertility rate, which stands at 4.3 children per woman. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 18.4 years, and is undergoing rapid urbanization, with 61.3% of the population living in urban areas. The urban population is concentrated in the capital city of Banjul and other major cities, such as Serekunda and Brikama.\n\nThe population of Gambia is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the country and to other countries in the region. Many Gambians migrate to neighboring countries, such as Senegal and Guinea, in search of better economic opportunities.

Despite its small size, Gambia has a significant impact on the regional economy, with a growing trade sector and a strategic location on the West African coast.\n\nThe population of Gambia is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and a declining mortality rate.
