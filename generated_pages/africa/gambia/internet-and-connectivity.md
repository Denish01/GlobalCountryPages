However, there is still a significant urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in urban areas such as **Banjul** and **Serrekunda**, while rural areas often have slower and less reliable connections. The reliability of the internet in Gambia can also be affected by power outages and maintenance, which can be frequent in some areas.

In general, the internet quality in Gambia is good enough for basic tasks such as browsing, emailing, and social media, but may not be sufficient for more demanding activities such as online gaming or streaming. The government has also made efforts to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the launch of a **national broadband network**, which aims to provide faster and more reliable internet connections to more areas of the country.
