Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to June and November. Avoid: July to October due to the rainy season and high humidity. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nGambia is a tropical country located in West Africa, with a climate that is characterized by a dry season and a wet season. The dry season, which runs from November to June, is the best time to visit Gambia, as the weather is dry and sunny, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 30°C. The wet season, which runs from July to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. The country's climate is divided into two main zones: the coastal zone, which is cooler and more humid, and the inland zone, which is hotter and drier. The dry season is the best time to visit Gambia's beaches, national parks, and wildlife reserves, as the weather is pleasant and the risk of malaria is lower.\n\nThe wet season, on the other hand, is not ideal for outdoor activities, as the heavy rainfall and high humidity can make it difficult to explore the country's natural beauty. However, the wet season is the best time to see Gambia's lush vegetation and green landscapes, as the rainfall brings new life to the country's flora. The wet season is also the best time to see the country's wildlife, as the animals are more active during this time.\n\nGambia's climate is also influenced by its geographical location, with the coastal zone being more prone to sea breezes and cooler temperatures. The inland zone, on the other hand, is hotter and drier, with temperatures often reaching 40°C during the dry season. The country's climate is also affected by the **harmattan**, a dry wind that blows from the Sahara Desert during the dry season, bringing dry and dusty air to the country.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Dry and sunny | Low | $ | Birdwatching, fishing |\n| February | Dry and sunny | Low | $ | Beaches, water sports |\n| March | Dry and sunny | Med | $$ | Wildlife, national parks |\n| April | Dry and sunny | Med | $$ | Cultural festivals, historical sites |\n| May | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | Trekking, hiking |\n| June | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | River cruises, boat tours |\n| July | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Green landscapes, lush vegetation |\n| August | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Wildlife, birdwatching |\n| September | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Cultural events, local markets |\n| October | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Fishing, water sports |\n| November | Dry and sunny | Med | $$ | Beaches, national parks |\n| December | Dry and sunny | High | $$$ | Christmas celebrations, New Year's Eve |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Roots Festival** | May | A cultural festival celebrating Gambia's history and heritage |\n| **Banjul Carnival** | April | A colorful carnival with music, dance, and costumes |\n| **Gambia International Arts Festival** | November | A festival showcasing local and international art, music, and performance |\n| **Kankurang Festival** | January | A traditional festival celebrating the country's masked dancers |\n| **International Roots Homecoming Festival** | August | A festival celebrating Gambia's diaspora community |\n| **Gambia Birdwatching Festival** | February | A festival for birdwatchers and nature lovers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The coastal region has a cooler and more humid climate than the inland region, making it ideal for beach activities and water sports.\n- The inland region is hotter and drier, with temperatures often reaching 40°C during the dry season, making it ideal for trekking and hiking.\n- The **River Gambia** region has a unique climate, with a mix of coastal and inland weather patterns, making it ideal for boat tours and river cruises.\n- The **Kiang West National Park** region has a dry and sunny climate, making it ideal for wildlife viewing and national park visits.\n- The **Senegalese border** region has a hotter and drier climate, with temperatures often reaching 45°C during the dry season, making it ideal for desert treks and adventure activities.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from May to June and November, for lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack light and breathable clothing, as well as sunscreen and insect repellent, to protect yourself from the sun and mosquitoes.\n- Bring a waterproof jacket or umbrella, as well as a power adapter, to prepare for unexpected rain showers and power outages.\n- Avoid traveling during the **Eid al-Fitr** and **Christmas** holidays, as prices and crowds can be higher during these times.\n- Research and respect local customs and traditions, especially during cultural festivals and events, to avoid unintentionally offending locals.",
