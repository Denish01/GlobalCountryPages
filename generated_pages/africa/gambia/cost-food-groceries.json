However, the country's reliance on imported goods and the high inflation rate of 11.6% can drive up prices. The eating-out culture in Gambia is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals opting to cook at home using traditional ingredients such as **rice**, **peanuts**, and **fish**. This is due in part to the relatively low cost of groceries, with a kilogram of rice costing around $1-$2 USD.\n\nThe cost of food in Gambia can vary depending on the location, with urban areas such as Banjul and Serrekunda tend to have higher prices than rural areas. Additionally, the country's **tourist season**, which runs from November to April, can also impact food prices, with many restaurants and hotels increasing their prices during this time. Despite these factors, Gambia remains a relatively affordable destination for food, with a wide range of traditional and international cuisine available.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 75 GMD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.00 | 50 GMD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 60 GMD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 50 GMD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 175 GMD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00 | 250 GMD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50 | 125 GMD | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 40 GMD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 40 GMD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 30 GMD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 200 GMD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50 | 25 GMD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes such as **benachin** or **yassa**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | (one person, international cuisine) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$25 | (3 courses, local and international cuisine) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | (upscale, international cuisine) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Gambia can be significant, with supermarkets tend to be more expensive due to the wider range of products and the convenience they offer.
