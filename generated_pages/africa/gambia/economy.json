The country's economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, driven by a combination of factors including agricultural production, tourism, and foreign investment. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events. Gambia's economic development level is still in its early stages, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line.\n\nThe country's economic trajectory is closely tied to its strategic location on the West African coast, with a growing tourism sector and a budding manufacturing industry. However, the economy faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate, particularly among young people, and a lack of economic diversification. The government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including investments in infrastructure and efforts to attract foreign investment.\n\nDespite these challenges, Gambia has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average annual rate of 3-4%. The country has also made efforts to improve its business environment, with a focus on simplifying regulatory procedures and reducing bureaucratic hurdles. However, more needs to be done to address the country's deep-seated economic challenges and promote sustainable economic growth.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20-30% of GDP | Main crops include peanuts, rice, and cotton |\n| Services | 40-50% of GDP | Includes tourism, finance, and trade |\n| Manufacturing | 10-20% of GDP | Main products include food processing, textiles, and construction materials |\n| Tourism | 5-10% of GDP | Growing sector, with a focus on eco-tourism and cultural tourism |\n| Fishing | 2-5% of GDP | Important sector, with a focus on artisanal and commercial fishing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Peanuts and peanut products\n- Fish and seafood\n- Cotton and textiles\n- Re-exports of refined petroleum products\n- Tourism services\n**Top Imports:** \n- Refined petroleum products\n- Food and beverages\n- Machinery and equipment\n- Vehicles and transportation equipment\n- Construction materials\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Senegal\n- China\n- United Kingdom\n- Netherlands\n- India\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country's transport network includes a major highway connecting the capital Banjul to the southern border with Senegal, as well as a network of secondary roads and rural tracks.\n- Energy production is largely based on fossil fuels, with a growing focus on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n- Internet and mobile penetration rates are relatively low, with approximately 20% of the population having access to the internet.\n- The country has a major port at Banjul, which handles the majority of its international trade, as well as a small airport at Yundum.\n- Efforts are being made to upgrade and expand the country's infrastructure, including investments in roads, energy, and telecommunications.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nGambia's economic outlook is cautiously optimistic, with the country expected to continue growing at a steady rate over the next few years. The government has prioritized investments in infrastructure, including roads, energy, and telecommunications, which are expected to support economic growth and development. The tourism sector is also expected to continue growing, driven by the country's unique cultural and natural attractions. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events.\n\nThe government has identified several key priorities for economic development, including promoting economic diversification, improving the business environment, and increasing access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises. Major projects and reforms include the development of a new national development plan, which aims to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. The government is also working to improve the country's investment climate, including through the establishment of a new investment promotion agency. Overall, while challenges remain, Gambia's economy has the potential to continue growing and developing over the next few years, driven by a combination of government support, private sector investment, and international cooperation.",
