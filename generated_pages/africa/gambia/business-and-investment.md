[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
The business environment in Gambia is generally open to foreign investment, with the government actively seeking to attract investors to stimulate economic growth. However, the country still faces challenges related to bureaucracy, corruption, and limited infrastructure. The government has implemented various reforms to improve the business climate, including the establishment of a one-stop shop for business registration and the introduction of a new investment promotion agency. Despite these efforts, corruption remains a significant obstacle, and companies may encounter difficulties in navigating the complex regulatory framework.

The government's attitude toward foreign investment is generally positive, with a focus on promoting private sector development and encouraging foreign direct investment. However, the level of bureaucracy can be high, and companies may need to navigate multiple agencies and procedures to obtain necessary permits and licenses. The country's limited infrastructure, particularly in the areas of transportation and energy, can also pose challenges for businesses.

Gambia has made significant progress in recent years in improving its business environment, including the introduction of a new commercial code and the establishment of a business advisory council. However, more needs to be done to address the remaining challenges and create a more favorable business climate.
