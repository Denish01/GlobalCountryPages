[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Gambia has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit is limited, with few options available, especially outside of the capital city Banjul. However, the country's small size and relatively low population density make it easy to navigate, and many people opt to walk or cycle for short journeys. The main transportation modes in Gambia are **buses**, **taxis**, and **ferries**, which connect the capital city to other parts of the country.

The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in Gambia means that many people rely on informal transportation options, such as **shared taxis** and **minibuses**, which can be affordable but may not always be safe or reliable. Despite these challenges, the country's transportation network is slowly improving, with investments in new roads and transportation infrastructure. However, the high **inflation rate** of 11.6% in 2024 can affect the cost of transportation, making it essential to plan and budget accordingly.
