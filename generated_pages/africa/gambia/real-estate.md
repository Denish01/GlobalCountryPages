The property market in Gambia has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by tourism and foreign investment. The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a range of options available for buyers and renters. The capital city, Banjul, is the hub of commercial and economic activity, while the coastal areas of Kotu, Fajara, and Brufut are popular with tourists and expats. The market is generally considered to be relatively affordable, with prices lower than in many other West African countries.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a range of properties available at competitive prices. However, the market can be volatile, and prices can fluctuate depending on factors such as the tourist season and global economic trends. Urban areas tend to be more developed and have better infrastructure, while rural areas are often more traditional and may lack basic amenities. The price trajectory of the market is generally upward, driven by increasing demand from tourists and foreign investors.

The government has implemented various initiatives to promote the property market and attract foreign investment, including the establishment of a dedicated investment promotion agency. These initiatives have helped to stimulate growth and development in the sector, and the market is expected to continue to evolve and expand in the coming years.
