[SECTION] Overview: Gambia vs Guinea-Bissau [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Gambia and Guinea-Bissau is relatively low compared to other countries in West Africa. However, Gambia has a slightly higher GDP per capita and a more stable economy, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Despite this, Gambia is still generally cheaper than Guinea-Bissau, with lower prices for rent, food, and transportation. The main reason for this is the difference in economic context, with Gambia having a more developed tourism industry and a stronger service sector, which drives up prices in Guinea-Bissau.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Gambia has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and services, while Guinea-Bissau's economy is largely dependent on agriculture and fishing. This diversity in Gambia's economy contributes to a more stable and predictable cost of living, whereas Guinea-Bissau's economy is more vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. As a result, Gambia is generally around 15-20% cheaper than Guinea-Bissau, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable place to live in West Africa.
