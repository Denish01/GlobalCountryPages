[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Gambia is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 12 and is provided free of charge by the government. Secondary education is also compulsory and is divided into two cycles: lower secondary (ages 13-15) and upper secondary (ages 16-18). The quality of education in Gambia is improving, with the government investing heavily in the sector, particularly in the areas of teacher training and infrastructure development. Public schools are the most common type of educational institution in Gambia, but there are also a number of private schools, particularly in the urban areas.

The public education system in Gambia is faced with a number of challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, the government is committed to providing quality education to all its citizens, and there are a number of initiatives underway to improve the education sector. For example, the government has introduced a number of programs to improve teacher training and to increase access to education for disadvantaged groups, such as girls and children with disabilities.

The tertiary education sector in Gambia is also growing, with a number of universities and colleges providing a range of academic programs. The University of The Gambia is the country's main public university and offers a range of undergraduate and graduate programs in fields such as agriculture, education, and health sciences. There are also a number of private universities and colleges, which offer a range of academic programs, including business, law, and computer science.
