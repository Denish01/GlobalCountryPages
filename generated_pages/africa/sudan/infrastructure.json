  "content": "Sudan's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks, although a substantial gap remains between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 45.3% of population\nInternet Penetration: 28.4%\nRoad Network: 11,900 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: 5,978 km\nMajor Airports: 16\nMajor Ports: 2, both located on the Red Sea coast\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSudan's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with significant challenges in terms of funding, maintenance, and access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Despite these challenges, the government has been investing heavily in recent years to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on roads, energy, and telecommunications. However, a substantial gap remains between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services. The government has also been working to attract foreign investment to support infrastructure development, with several major projects currently underway or planned.\n\nThe country's infrastructure has been impacted by years of conflict and economic sanctions, which have limited access to funding and technology. However, with the lifting of sanctions and the signing of several major investment deals, Sudan is now poised to embark on a major infrastructure development program. This program is expected to focus on improving the country's transport networks, increasing access to electricity and water, and developing its telecommunications sector.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing Sudan's infrastructure development is the lack of funding, with the government relying heavily on foreign investment and aid to support its development programs. However, with the discovery of significant oil reserves and the growth of the country's agricultural sector, Sudan is now generating significant revenue, which is being invested in infrastructure development.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 11,900 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved and in need of maintenance |\n| Railways | 5,978 km | Moderate | Limited passenger services, mostly used for freight |\n| Airports | 16 international and domestic | Good | Several major airports, including Khartoum International |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Both ports located on the Red Sea coast, handling significant cargo volumes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Sudan's power generation sector is dominated by **thermal power plants**, which account for around 70% of the country's total electricity generation.\n- The country is also investing heavily in **renewable energy**, with several major solar and wind power projects currently underway or planned.\n- Despite these investments, Sudan still experiences frequent **power outages**, particularly in rural areas, due to a lack of generating capacity and inadequate transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n- The government has set a target of increasing the country's electricity access rate to 70% of the population by 2025, with a focus on improving access in rural areas.\n- Sudan is also working to improve the **reliability** of its electricity supply, with several major projects currently underway to upgrade the country's transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a major concern in Sudan, with many people relying on untreated water sources due to a lack of access to safe drinking water.\n- The country's **sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many rural communities lacking access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- The government has set a target of increasing access to **safe drinking water** to 80% of the population by 2025, with a focus on improving access in rural areas.\n- Sudan is also working to improve **water access** in rural areas, with several major projects currently underway to develop the country's water infrastructure.\n- The country is also investing in **water conservation** measures, with a focus on reducing water waste and improving the efficiency of its water infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Sudan's **mobile coverage** is relatively good, with several major operators providing services across the country.\n- The country is also investing heavily in **fiber and broadband** infrastructure, with several major projects currently underway to develop its telecommunications sector.\n- **4G and 5G rollout** is also underway, with several major operators launching services in recent years.\n- Sudan's **postal services** are relatively well-developed, with a comprehensive network of post offices across the country.\n- The government has set a target of increasing **internet penetration** to 50% of the population by 2025, with a focus on improving access in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Khartoum-Port Sudan Railway** project is a major infrastructure development project currently underway, which will improve the country's rail network and increase trade volumes.\n- The **Red Sea Port Expansion** project is another major development project, which will increase the country's cargo handling capacity and improve its trade competitiveness.\n- Sudan is also investing in several major **road development projects**, including the construction of a new highway linking Khartoum to the Red Sea coast.\n- The country is also working to develop its **energy sector**, with several major projects currently underway to increase the country's electricity generating capacity and improve the reliability of its electricity supply.\n- The **Sudan-Egypt Electricity Interconnection** project is a major regional development project, which will increase the country's access to electricity and improve its energy security.",
