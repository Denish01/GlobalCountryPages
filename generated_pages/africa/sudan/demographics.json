The population growth rate is relatively high, driven by a combination of factors including a high total fertility rate and improvements in healthcare. The median age of the population is approximately 20 years, indicating a relatively young population. Urbanization is a growing trend, with over a third of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Khartoum and other major cities such as Omdurman and Port Sudan. Migration patterns in Sudan are complex, with both internal and international migration occurring due to factors such as conflict, economic opportunities, and environmental changes.\n\nThe population of Sudan is expected to continue growing, with significant implications for the country's economy, infrastructure, and social services. The government and international organizations are working to address the challenges associated with rapid population growth, including providing access to education, healthcare, and family planning services. Sudan's population is also affected by environmental factors, such as desertification and climate change, which can impact agricultural productivity and food security.\n\nSudan's population is characterized by significant regional disparities, with some areas experiencing rapid growth and urbanization while others remain relatively underdeveloped. The government is working to address these disparities through investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, as well as initiatives to promote economic development and reduce poverty.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arab | 70% | Northern and central regions | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Fur | 10% | Darfur region | Significant minority group |\n| Beja | 6% | Eastern region | Historically nomadic people |\n| Nubian | 5% | Northern region | Ancient civilization with distinct culture |\n| Zaghawa | 4% | Darfur region | Significant minority group |\n| Masalit | 3% | Darfur region | Minority group with distinct language and culture |\n[/TABLE]\nSudan's ethnic diversity is significant, with over 500 ethnic groups represented in the country.
