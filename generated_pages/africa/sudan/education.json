Primary education, also known as **basic education**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 14, and is typically divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for four years, and the second cycle lasts for four years as well. Secondary education, also known as **general secondary education**, is not compulsory, but is required for students who wish to pursue tertiary education. Tertiary education, also known as **higher education**, is offered at universities and colleges, and typically lasts for four years. The quality of education in Sudan varies, with public schools often facing challenges such as overcrowding and limited resources, while private schools tend to offer better facilities and more qualified teachers.\n\nThe Sudanese education system is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, administering exams, and regulating the education sector. The ministry has implemented various reforms in recent years, aimed at improving the quality of education and increasing access to education for all. Despite these efforts, the education system in Sudan still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources.\n\nThe public and private sectors play different roles in the education system in Sudan. Public schools are free and open to all, but often face challenges such as overcrowding and limited resources. Private schools, on the other hand, are fee-paying and tend to offer better facilities and more qualified teachers. However, private schools are often out of reach for many Sudanese families, due to the high costs involved.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
