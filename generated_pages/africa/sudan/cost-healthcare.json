  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Sudan varies significantly between public and private facilities, with public healthcare services being generally more affordable but often lacking in quality and availability, while private facilities offer better services but at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $21 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 57.4% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 999\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: SDG\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSudan's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of quality and availability of services. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better services but are often expensive and out of reach for the average citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private facilities. It is recommended to have health insurance when traveling to or living in Sudan, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially in private facilities.\n\nThe healthcare system in Sudan is also facing challenges such as a shortage of medical professionals, limited access to healthcare services in rural areas, and a high burden of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system, including the development of new healthcare facilities and the implementation of health insurance programs. For example, the government has introduced a national health insurance scheme, which aims to provide health coverage to all citizens, including those in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's qualifications |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Prices vary by city and dentist's qualifications |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and optometrist's qualifications |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and lab's qualifications |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of surgery |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$300 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers medical services worldwide, including evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available in pharmacies and cost between $5-$10 per prescription.\n- Prescription medications are required for most medications, and a doctor's prescription is necessary to purchase them.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are available in pharmacies and supermarkets, and cost between $2-$5 per packet.\n- Medication prices vary by city and pharmacy, and may be higher in private hospitals and clinics.\n- It is recommended to purchase medications from licensed pharmacies to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 999 or go to the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available in major cities, but may be limited in rural areas. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private facilities, which offer better services and equipment. For example, the Khartoum Teaching Hospital and the Royal Care International Hospital are two of the best hospitals in Khartoum, offering a wide range of medical services, including emergency care and surgeries. It is also recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including your embassy and insurance provider, in case of a medical emergency.\n\nEmergency care in Sudan can be challenging, especially in rural areas where medical facilities and personnel may be limited. However, there are efforts underway to improve emergency care, including the development of emergency medical services and the training of emergency medical personnel. For example, the Sudanese Red Crescent Society offers emergency medical services, including ambulance transport and first aid, in major cities and towns. Despite these efforts, it is still important to take precautions when traveling to or living in Sudan, such as having a first aid kit and knowing basic first aid techniques.",
