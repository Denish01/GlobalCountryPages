# Sudan Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Sudan's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks, although a substantial gap remains between urban and rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 45.3% of population
Internet Penetration: 28.4%
Road Network: 11,900 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: 5,978 km
Major Airports: 16
Major Ports: 2, both located on the Red Sea coast
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Sudan's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with significant challenges in terms of funding, maintenance, and access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Despite these challenges, the government has been investing heavily in recent years to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on roads, energy, and telecommunications. However, a substantial gap remains between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services. The government has also been working to attract foreign investment to support infrastructure development, with several major projects currently underway or planned.

The country's infrastructure has been impacted by years of conflict and economic sanctions, which have limited access to funding and technology. However, with the lifting of sanctions and the signing of several major investment deals, Sudan is now poised to embark on a major infrastructure development program. This program is expected to focus on improving the country's transport networks, increasing access to electricity and water, and developing its telecommunications sector.

One of the major challenges facing Sudan's infrastructure development is the lack of funding, with the government relying heavily on foreign investment and aid to support its development programs. However, with the discovery of significant oil reserves and the growth of the country's agricultural sector, Sudan is now generating significant revenue, which is being invested in infrastructure development.
