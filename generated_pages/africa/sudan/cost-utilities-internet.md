[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Sudan's utility infrastructure is still developing, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. The cost of utilities can be unstable and fluctuating, with prices increasing significantly over the past few years due to inflation and currency devaluation. The country's high inflation rate of 138.8% in 2022 has led to a significant increase in the cost of living, including utility bills. Additionally, there is a seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher electricity bills during the hot summer months when air conditioning usage is high.

The Sudanese government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the national grid and the development of new power plants. However, the progress has been slow, and the country still faces significant challenges in providing reliable and affordable utilities to its citizens. The high cost of utilities, particularly electricity, has been a major concern for many Sudanese households, with some families spending up to 30% of their income on utility bills.
