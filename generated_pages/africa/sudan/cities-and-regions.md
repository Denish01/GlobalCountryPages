[SECTION] How Sudan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Sudan is divided into 18 states or wilayat, which are further divided into localities. Each state has its own capital and is administered by a governor who is appointed by the federal government. The states are grouped into five main regions: the north, which includes the states of Northern, River Nile, and Red Sea; the east, which includes the states of Kassala and Al Qadarif; the central region, which includes the states of Khartoum, Gezira, and White Nile; the west, which includes the states of North Darfur, South Darfur, and West Darfur; and the south, which includes the states of Blue Nile, Sennar, and North Kordofan.

The administrative structure of Sudan is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of services and the implementation of development projects at the local level. The states have a significant degree of autonomy, with their own governments and budgets, and are responsible for providing a range of services, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The federal government, on the other hand, is responsible for matters such as national security, foreign policy, and economic policy.
