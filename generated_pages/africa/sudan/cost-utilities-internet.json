  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Sudan can vary greatly depending on the location, usage, and provider, with a typical monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment ranging from $50 to $150 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($100 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: SDG\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nSudan's utility infrastructure is still developing, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. The cost of utilities can be unstable and fluctuating, with prices increasing significantly over the past few years due to inflation and currency devaluation. The country's high inflation rate of 138.8% in 2022 has led to a significant increase in the cost of living, including utility bills. Additionally, there is a seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher electricity bills during the hot summer months when air conditioning usage is high.\n\nThe Sudanese government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the national grid and the development of new power plants. However, the progress has been slow, and the country still faces significant challenges in providing reliable and affordable utilities to its citizens. The high cost of utilities, particularly electricity, has been a major concern for many Sudanese households, with some families spending up to 30% of their income on utility bills.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$85** | **$120** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Sudatel, Zain |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Sudatel, Zain |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1 GB | Zain, MTN |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Zain, MTN |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Sudatel, Zain |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $5 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Sudan, it is recommended to contact the local providers, such as Sudatel or Zain, and provide the necessary documents, including a copy of your passport and a rental agreement.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely used in Sudan, allowing households to control their energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Sudan are Sudatel and Zain, offering a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take simple steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or carpooling.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with the landlord or property manager to include utility bills in the rent or to get a discount on the rent if the household is responsible for paying the utility bills.",
