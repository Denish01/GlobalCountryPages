  "content": "The cost of living in Sudan is generally considered to be affordable, with a daily budget of $20-50 USD for backpackers, $50-100 USD for mid-range travelers, and $100-200 USD for those seeking comfort.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nCost Level: Affordable\nDaily Budget (Backpacker): $20-50 USD\nDaily Budget (Mid-Range): $50-100 USD\nDaily Budget (Comfort): $100-200 USD\nCurrency: SDG\nTipping Custom: not expected\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] How Expensive Is Sudan? [/SECTION]\nSudan is a relatively affordable country to visit or live in, especially when compared to its North African and Middle Eastern neighbors. The cost of living in Sudan is lower than in Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia, but slightly higher than in South Sudan and Chad. The country's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including high inflation and a shortage of foreign currency, which can make it difficult for visitors to access cash and find affordable accommodation. However, for those who are willing to navigate these challenges, Sudan can be a rewarding and affordable destination.\n\nIn terms of global averages, Sudan is considered to be a lower-middle-income country, with a relatively low cost of living. The country's capital, Khartoum, is the most expensive city in Sudan, but it is still relatively affordable compared to other major cities in Africa and the Middle East. Outside of Khartoum, the cost of living in Sudan can be even lower, with many basic necessities and services available at a fraction of the cost of what they would be in more developed countries.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $10-20 | basic rooms with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $30-60 | air-conditioned rooms with private bathrooms |\n| Luxury/Resort | $100-200 | high-end hotels with amenities like pools and restaurants |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $200-500 | city center vs outside, with utilities and furniture |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-5 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-30 |\n| Fine Dining | $30-50 |\n| Beer (local) | $3-5 |\n| Coffee | $1-2 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.50-1 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $50-100 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50-1 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 200 | 400 | 800 |\n| Food | 150 | 300 | 500 |\n| Transport | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Utilities | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Entertainment | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| **Total** | **500** | **1000** | **2000** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in budget-friendly accommodation options like hostels or guesthouses, which can be found for as low as $10-20 USD per night.\n- Eat at local restaurants or street food stalls, which can offer delicious and affordable meals for $2-5 USD.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible, as taxis and private cars can be expensive.\n- Avoid exchanging money at airports or hotels, as the rates can be unfavorable - instead, use ATMs or exchange offices in cities.\n- Haggle when shopping at markets or from street vendors, as prices can often be negotiated.\n- Consider visiting during the off-season (April-May or September-October), when prices for accommodation and tours can be lower.",
