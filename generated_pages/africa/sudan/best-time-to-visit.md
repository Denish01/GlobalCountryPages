[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Sudan has a tropical climate with three main seasons: winter, summer, and the rainy season. The winter season, which runs from December to February, is the coolest and driest period, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). This is the best time to visit Sudan, as the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities such as sightseeing, hiking, and exploring the country's many historical sites. The summer season, which runs from March to May, is extremely hot, with temperatures often reaching 40°C (104°F) or higher. The rainy season, which runs from June to September, brings some relief from the heat, but also makes travel more difficult due to flooding and mud.

The climate in Sudan varies greatly from north to south, with the northern region being generally drier and hotter than the southern region. The **Sahara Desert**, which covers much of northern Sudan, is one of the harshest environments on Earth, with extreme heat, limited vegetation, and scarce water resources. In contrast, the southern region is more fertile and has a more tropical climate, with heavier rainfall and more abundant vegetation. Understanding these climate zones is essential for planning a trip to Sudan, as they can greatly affect travel plans and activities.

The seasons in Sudan also affect the country's many festivals and events, which are an important part of the country's culture and heritage. Many of these festivals take place during the winter months, when the weather is cooler and more pleasant. For example, the **Khartoum International Festival**, which takes place in February, is one of the largest and most popular festivals in the country, featuring music, dance, and theater performances from around the world.
