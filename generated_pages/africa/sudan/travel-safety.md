[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Sudan is a vast and diverse country, with different regions presenting unique safety challenges. While the capital city, Khartoum, is generally considered safe, other areas, particularly in the western region of Darfur, are prone to violence and instability. Travelers should be aware of the risk of petty crime, such as pickpocketing and scams, as well as the potential for violent crime, including armed robbery and carjacking. Additionally, the country's healthcare system is underdeveloped, and medical facilities may not be equipped to handle serious emergencies.

Despite these challenges, many travelers visit Sudan without incident, and with proper planning and precautions, it is possible to have a safe and enjoyable experience in the country. The Sudanese people are known for their hospitality, and visitors are often welcomed with warmth and generosity.

This includes staying up-to-date with the latest travel advisories, avoiding travel to high-risk areas, and being mindful of personal belongings and surroundings.
