The rental market is largely unregulated, which can make it challenging for tenants to find affordable and secure housing. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through informal negotiations. Compared to regional neighbors, Sudan's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center, due to the country's growing economy and limited housing supply.\n\nThe high inflation rate of 138.8% in 2022 has also contributed to the increasing cost of living in Sudan, including housing prices. Additionally, the limited availability of **mortgage financing** and the high cost of **construction materials** have driven up property prices. However, the Sudanese government has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new residential areas and the provision of **subsidized housing** for low-income families.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $150-$300 | Furnished, air conditioning, internet |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$600 | $250-$500 | Family size, **furnished**, parking available |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$1,000 | $400-$800 | Spacious, **unfurnished**, garden or balcony |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$5,000 | Prime locations, **commercial areas** |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$3,000 | Residential areas, **family-friendly** |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | Agricultural areas, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Khartoum 2**: A popular neighborhood for expats, with rents ranging from $300-$600 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, offering a mix of **modern amenities** and traditional Sudanese culture.\n- **Amarat**: A upscale neighborhood with rents ranging from $500-$1,000 USD per month for a two-bedroom apartment, featuring **luxury amenities** and a **secure environment**.\n- **Riyadh**: A family-friendly neighborhood with rents ranging from $300-$600 USD per month for a three-bedroom apartment, offering **spacious living** and **easy access** to schools and amenities.\n- **Khartoum North**: A rapidly developing neighborhood with rents ranging from $200-$400 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, featuring **new amenities** and **investment opportunities**.\n- **Omdurman**: A historic neighborhood with rents ranging from $150-$300 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, offering **traditional architecture** and **cultural experiences**.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Sudan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find **affordable options** and **secure environments**.\n- Work with a **reputable real estate agent** to find suitable properties and navigate the rental process.\n- Be prepared to **negotiate prices** and **terms** with landlords.\n- Be aware of **scams** and **fraudulent activities** in the rental market, and always **verify** the ownership and **legitimacy** of properties.\n- Utilities such as **electricity** and **water** are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget.\n- Furnished apartments are **common**, but **unfurnished** options are also available, so clarify the **furnishing** status before signing a lease.",
