[SECTION] How Expensive Is Sudan? [/SECTION]
Sudan is a relatively affordable country to visit or live in, especially when compared to its North African and Middle Eastern neighbors. The cost of living in Sudan is lower than in Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia, but slightly higher than in South Sudan and Chad. The country's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including high inflation and a shortage of foreign currency, which can make it difficult for visitors to access cash and find affordable accommodation. However, for those who are willing to navigate these challenges, Sudan can be a rewarding and affordable destination.

In terms of global averages, Sudan is considered to be a lower-middle-income country, with a relatively low cost of living. The country's capital, Khartoum, is the most expensive city in Sudan, but it is still relatively affordable compared to other major cities in Africa and the Middle East. Outside of Khartoum, the cost of living in Sudan can be even lower, with many basic necessities and services available at a fraction of the cost of what they would be in more developed countries.

- Eat at local restaurants or street food stalls, which can offer delicious and affordable meals for $2-5 USD.
- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible, as taxis and private cars can be expensive.
