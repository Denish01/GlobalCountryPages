Highest Point: Deriba Caldera, 3,042 meters
Lowest Point: Red Sea, 0 meters
Coastline: 853 km
Borders: Egypt, Libya, Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea
Climate Type: tropical and arid
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Sudan is situated in northeastern Africa, with its borders shared by seven countries: Egypt to the north, Libya to the northwest, Chad to the west, the Central African Republic to the southwest, South Sudan to the south, Ethiopia to the southeast, and Eritrea to the east. The country has a coastline along the Red Sea to the northeast, providing access to international shipping lanes and trade routes. Sudan's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.

The country's borders are defined by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries, including rivers, deserts, and mountain ranges. The Nile River, which flows through the heart of Sudan, has played a crucial role in shaping the country's history and culture. The river's annual flooding brought nutrient-rich silt that made the surrounding land suitable for agriculture, supporting the growth of ancient civilizations such as the Kingdom of Kush. Today, the Nile remains a vital source of water and transportation for Sudan's population.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Sudan's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including deserts, mountains, and rivers. The Sahara Desert covers much of the country's western and northern regions, with vast expanses of sand dunes and rocky outcrops. In contrast, the eastern and southeastern parts of Sudan are home to mountain ranges, including the Marrah Mountains and the Ethiopian Highlands. These mountainous regions are home to a range of flora and fauna, including tropical forests, grasslands, and wildlife such as lions, leopards, and elephants.

The Nile River and its tributaries have carved out a network of valleys and deltas that support a wide range of agricultural activities, including cotton, sugarcane, and wheat production. The Sudd, a vast wetland area in southern Sudan, is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including crocodiles, hippos, and over 400 species of birds. The Red Sea coastline, which stretches for over 800 kilometers, features a range of coral reefs, islands, and marine ecosystems that support commercial fishing and tourism industries.

The country's terrain has also been shaped by geological processes, including volcanic activity and tectonic plate movement. The Deriba Caldera, located in the Marrah Mountains, is a large volcanic crater that rises to an elevation of over 3,000 meters. The caldera is surrounded by a range of volcanic peaks and valleys, creating a unique and dramatic landscape.
