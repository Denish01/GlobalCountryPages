[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Sudan's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, which includes hospitals, health centers, and clinics. However, the system faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. The quality of care varies significantly depending on the location and type of facility, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities. Despite these challenges, the Sudanese government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of universal health insurance and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.

The public healthcare system in Sudan is generally underfunded and understaffed, with many facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality care, but at a cost that is often out of reach for many Sudanese citizens. Foreigners and expatriates often opt for private healthcare services, which are generally of better quality. However, even private facilities may not meet international standards, and medical evacuation to other countries may be necessary in some cases.

The healthcare system in Sudan also faces significant challenges in terms of access, particularly in rural areas. Many rural areas lack basic healthcare facilities, and those that do exist often lack adequate staff, equipment, and supplies. This has resulted in significant disparities in health outcomes between urban and rural areas, with rural areas generally having poorer health outcomes.
