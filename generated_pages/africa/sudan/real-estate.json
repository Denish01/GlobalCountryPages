However, the market is still relatively underdeveloped, and prices can vary significantly depending on the location and type of property. In urban areas like Khartoum and Omdurman, prices are higher due to demand for housing and commercial space, while rural areas tend to be more affordable. The current market trend is towards increased demand for apartments and residential complexes, particularly in areas with access to amenities like schools, hospitals, and shopping centers.\n\nThe price trajectory in Sudan is generally upwards, with some fluctuations due to economic factors like inflation and currency exchange rates. The government has implemented policies to encourage investment in the property sector, including tax incentives and simplified registration procedures. Despite these efforts, the market remains relatively opaque, and buyers should exercise caution when navigating the purchasing process. Urban areas tend to offer more modern amenities and services, while rural areas provide a more traditional way of life, with many Sudanese preferring to invest in rural properties for agricultural or vacation purposes.\n\nOverall, the Sudanese property market presents opportunities for investors and homebuyers, but it requires careful research and planning to navigate the local regulations and customs. The government's efforts to develop the sector and attract foreign investment are expected to drive growth and modernization in the coming years. With the right guidance and support, buyers can find attractive properties in Sudan, whether for personal use or as a investment opportunity.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Khartoum | 200 | 150 | Apartment |\n| Omdurman | 180 | 120 | House |\n| Port Sudan | 150 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Kassala | 120 | 80 | House |\n| Gedaref | 100 | 60 | Apartment |\n| Wad Madani | 80 | 50 | House |\n| El Fasher | 60 | 40 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Sudan, but they must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Justice, which can take several months to process.\n- Foreign companies can own property in Sudan, but they must be registered with the Ministry of Investment.\n- Leasehold agreements are available for foreigners, with terms ranging from 5 to 50 years, depending on the location and type of property.\n- Foreigners can also own property through a **Sudanese company**, which can be established with a minimum of two shareholders and a registered office in Sudan.\n- **Residency permits** are required for foreigners who want to live in Sudan, and these can be obtained through the Ministry of Interior.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
