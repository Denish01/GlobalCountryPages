[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Sudan is a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $559, indicating a significant development challenge. The country has been working to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing its industrial sector, particularly in the areas of textiles, food processing, and construction materials. However, the economy remains heavily reliant on agriculture, with the sector accounting for around 30% of GDP. Sudan's economic trajectory has been impacted by various factors, including conflict, corruption, and a lack of economic reform, which have hindered the country's ability to achieve sustainable economic growth.

The country's economic classification as a low-income economy is due to its limited economic development, low standard of living, and high levels of poverty. Sudan's development level is also affected by its limited access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, but more needs to be done to address the country's significant development challenges.

Sudan's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a decline in oil production, which has reduced government revenue and led to a significant trade deficit. The country has also faced significant inflationary pressures, with inflation rates often exceeding 50%. To address these challenges, the government has implemented various economic reforms, including the introduction of a new currency and the removal of fuel subsidies.
