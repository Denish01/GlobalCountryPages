  "content": "Sudan's economy is driven by a mix of agriculture, mining, and services, with a growing focus on diversification and development of its industrial sector. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($28 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($559 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Low)\nMain Industries: Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing\nCurrency: SDG\nUnemployment Rate: (19% approximate)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 171 out of 190 economies)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nSudan is a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $559, indicating a significant development challenge. The country has been working to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing its industrial sector, particularly in the areas of textiles, food processing, and construction materials. However, the economy remains heavily reliant on agriculture, with the sector accounting for around 30% of GDP. Sudan's economic trajectory has been impacted by various factors, including conflict, corruption, and a lack of economic reform, which have hindered the country's ability to achieve sustainable economic growth.\n\nThe country's economic classification as a low-income economy is due to its limited economic development, low standard of living, and high levels of poverty. Sudan's development level is also affected by its limited access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, but more needs to be done to address the country's significant development challenges.\n\nSudan's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a decline in oil production, which has reduced government revenue and led to a significant trade deficit. The country has also faced significant inflationary pressures, with inflation rates often exceeding 50%. To address these challenges, the government has implemented various economic reforms, including the introduction of a new currency and the removal of fuel subsidies.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 30% of GDP | Cotton, sugarcane, and peanuts are major crops, with the sector providing employment for around 80% of the workforce |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Gold, iron ore, and copper are significant minerals, with the sector contributing to export earnings |\n| Manufacturing | 5% of GDP | Textiles, food processing, and construction materials are key areas, with the sector providing employment opportunities and contributing to GDP |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | Financial services, telecommunications, and trade are significant contributors, with the sector driving economic growth |\n| Tourism | 1% of GDP | The sector has potential for growth, with attractions such as the Pyramids of Meroe and the Red Sea coast |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Gold**: Sudan is a significant gold producer, with gold exports accounting for a substantial portion of the country's export earnings.\n- **Cotton**: Cotton is a major crop in Sudan, with the country exporting significant quantities of cotton to countries such as China and India.\n- **Oil**: Sudan is an oil producer, with the country exporting oil to countries such as China and Japan.\n- **Sugarcane**: Sugarcane is another significant crop in Sudan, with the country exporting sugarcane to countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n- **Peanuts**: Peanuts are a major crop in Sudan, with the country exporting peanuts to countries such as China and India.\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery**: Sudan imports significant quantities of machinery, including equipment for the oil and gas sector.\n- **Vehicles**: The country imports vehicles, including cars and trucks, to meet the needs of its growing population.\n- **Electronics**: Sudan imports electronics, including computers and mobile phones, to meet the needs of its growing middle class.\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: The country imports pharmaceuticals to meet the needs of its healthcare sector.\n- **Foodstuffs**: Sudan imports foodstuffs, including wheat and rice, to meet the needs of its population.\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: China is a significant trading partner for Sudan, with the two countries having strong economic ties.\n- Egypt: Egypt is another key trading partner, with the two countries having a long-standing economic relationship.\n- United Arab Emirates: The UAE is also a significant trading partner, with the country investing heavily in Sudan's economy.\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country has a significant transportation network, including over 4,000 kilometers of paved roads and a major port at Port Sudan.\n- Sudan has a number of airports, including Khartoum International Airport, which provides connections to major cities in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.\n- The country has a limited energy sector, with most of its electricity generated from oil and gas.\n- Internet penetration is relatively low, at around 30% of the population, although mobile phone penetration is higher, at around 70%.\n- The country has a number of major ports, including Port Sudan, which is a significant hub for trade in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nSudan's economic outlook is uncertain, with the country facing significant challenges, including a large trade deficit, high inflation, and a significant dependence on imports.
