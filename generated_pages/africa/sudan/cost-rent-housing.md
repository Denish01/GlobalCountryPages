[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Sudan's housing market is characterized by a high demand for rental properties, particularly in the capital city of Khartoum. The rental market is largely unregulated, which can make it challenging for tenants to find affordable and secure housing. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through informal negotiations. Compared to regional neighbors, Sudan's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center, due to the country's growing economy and limited housing supply.

The high inflation rate of 138.8% in 2022 has also contributed to the increasing cost of living in Sudan, including housing prices. Additionally, the limited availability of **mortgage financing** and the high cost of **construction materials** have driven up property prices. However, the Sudanese government has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new residential areas and the provision of **subsidized housing** for low-income families.
