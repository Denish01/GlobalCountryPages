[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Sudan are generally higher than the regional average, driven up by the country's high inflation rate of 138.8% in 2022. The cost of eating out can be relatively expensive, especially in mid-range and fine dining restaurants, where a meal for two can cost between $20-$50 USD. However, traditional Sudanese cuisine, such as **gurassa** (flatbread) with **molokhiya** (stew), can be found at inexpensive restaurants and street food stalls for a fraction of the cost. Home cooking is a common practice in Sudan, with many locals preferring to buy ingredients from local markets and cook traditional meals at home.

The high cost of food in Sudan is also driven by the country's reliance on imports, which can be expensive due to transportation costs and taxes. Additionally, the country's **agricultural sector** is still developing, which can lead to shortages and price fluctuations for certain products. Despite these challenges, Sudan has a rich culinary tradition, with popular dishes such as **kisra** (flatbread) and **ahwa** (coffee) being staples of the local diet. Eating out is not as common in Sudan as in other countries, but it is becoming more popular, especially among the younger population.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Sudan. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices up to 50% higher than those found at local markets. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and can be more convenient for those who prefer to shop in a single location. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more traditional shopping experience, with vendors selling fresh produce, meats, and other staples. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and buyers can often negotiate prices down by 10-20%.

When shopping at local markets, it's best to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, as well as meats and spices. These items are often cheaper and of better quality than those found at supermarkets. However, for packaged goods, such as rice, pasta, and canned goods, supermarkets may be a better option. It's also worth noting that local markets can be crowded and chaotic, and buyers should be prepared to haggle and navigate through the stalls.
