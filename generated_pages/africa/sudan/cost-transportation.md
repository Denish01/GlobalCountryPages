[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Sudan has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **public buses**, **minibuses**, and **taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Khartoum having a more comprehensive network of buses and taxis compared to other cities. However, the lack of a well-organized public transportation system makes it challenging for people to move around, especially in rural areas. Many Sudanese people also rely on **walking** or **cycling** as a mode of transportation, especially for short distances.

The transportation infrastructure in Sudan is still developing, with many roads in need of repair and maintenance. This can make traveling by car or bus challenging, especially during the rainy season. Despite these challenges, the Sudanese government has been investing in the development of the transportation sector, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the public transportation network. However, more needs to be done to improve the quality and accessibility of transportation in Sudan.
