The education system in Sudan is overseen by the Ministry of Education, with a focus on providing free and compulsory education to all citizens. However, the quality of public education can vary greatly depending on the region and the school, with some institutions lacking basic resources and infrastructure. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significant cost. The language of instruction in Sudan is Arabic, with English being taught as a secondary language. Compulsory education in Sudan lasts for 8 years, starting at the age of 6. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.

The quality of education in Sudan is a significant concern, with many schools facing challenges such as overcrowding, lack of resources, and inadequate teacher training. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent schools in Sudan, particularly in the private sector, that offer a high-quality education. International schools in Sudan are also popular among expats and locals alike, offering a range of curricula and extracurricular activities. However, these schools can be quite expensive, with tuition fees ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars per year.
