Sudanese cuisine is also characterized by its use of spices, such as cumin, coriander, and cinnamon, which add depth and warmth to many dishes.\n\nRegional variations in Sudanese cuisine are also significant, with different regions having their own unique specialties and cooking styles. For example, the northern region is known for its **Kisra**, a thin flatbread made from sorghum flour, while the western region is famous for its **Gurassa**, a thick flatbread served with a variety of stews.
