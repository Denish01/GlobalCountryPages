  "content": "The cost of transportation in Sudan varies depending on the mode of transport, with a monthly transit pass costing around $10-$15 USD and a taxi start rate of $1-$2 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($10-$15 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($1-$2 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($0.60-$0.80 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (Yes — apps like Careem and Uber)\nCurrency: SDG\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nSudan has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **public buses**, **minibuses**, and **taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Khartoum having a more comprehensive network of buses and taxis compared to other cities. However, the lack of a well-organized public transportation system makes it challenging for people to move around, especially in rural areas. Many Sudanese people also rely on **walking** or **cycling** as a mode of transportation, especially for short distances.\n\nThe transportation infrastructure in Sudan is still developing, with many roads in need of repair and maintenance. This can make traveling by car or bus challenging, especially during the rainy season. Despite these challenges, the Sudanese government has been investing in the development of the transportation sector, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the public transportation network. However, more needs to be done to improve the quality and accessibility of transportation in Sudan.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, crowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Extensive routes, affordable |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$2.00 | $20-$30 | Limited routes, old trains |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.20-$0.50 | $5-$10 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.50-$3.00 | $0.30-$0.60 | $5-$15 | Careem and Uber available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.60-$0.80 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.50-$0.70 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-$50 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $1-$5 | Depending on route and distance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Depending on route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Typical route, depending on airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, old trains, depending on class |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **public buses** or **minibuses**, which are affordable and widely available.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Careem or Uber to book taxis or private cars, especially at night or in areas with limited public transportation.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a taxi, especially if you're not using a metered taxi.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded public transportation.\n- Consider **renting a car** if you plan to travel extensively outside of cities, but be prepared for challenging road conditions.\n- Download **maps and transportation apps** to help you navigate Sudan's transportation system and find the best routes.",
