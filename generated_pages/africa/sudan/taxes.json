However, individuals who are considered tax residents of Sudan are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with certain exceptions. To be considered a tax resident, an individual must have a permanent home in Sudan, or have been present in the country for more than 182 days in a calendar year. The tax year in Sudan runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of March of the following year.\n\nThe Sudanese tax system is based on a **self-assessment** approach, where taxpayers are required to calculate their own tax liability and file their tax returns with the Ministry of Finance. The tax authority may conduct audits to verify the accuracy of tax returns, and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance or underpayment of taxes. Taxpayers who are unsure about their tax obligations or need assistance with tax compliance can consult with a qualified tax professional or contact the Ministry of Finance for guidance.\n\n[SECTION] Personal Income Tax [/SECTION]\n| Income Bracket (SDG) | Tax Rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 - 15,000 | 0% |\n| 15,001 - 30,000 | 5% |\n| 30,001 - 50,000 | 10% |\n| 50,001 - 100,000 | 12% |\n| 100,001 and above | 15% |\nTaxpayers in Sudan are entitled to certain **deductions and allowances**, such as a personal allowance of SDG 10,000, and deductions for medical expenses, charitable donations, and mortgage interest.
