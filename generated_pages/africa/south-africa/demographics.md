[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
South Africa's population size is significant in the context of the African continent, with the country accounting for approximately 5% of the continent's total population. The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the past few decades, from 2.5% in the 1990s to the current rate of 1.3%. This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including declining fertility rates and increasing urbanization. The urban population accounts for approximately 67.4% of the total population, with many people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Migration patterns in South Africa are complex, with both internal and international migration playing a significant role in shaping the country's demographic landscape.

The country's urbanization trend is expected to continue, with many people moving to cities such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban in search of employment and better living standards. However, this trend also poses significant challenges, including increased pressure on urban infrastructure and services. To address these challenges, the government has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving the quality of life for urban residents.

The population of South Africa is also characterized by significant internal migration, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities. This migration has contributed to the growth of urban areas, with many cities experiencing rapid population growth. However, it has also led to the emergence of informal settlements and slums, which pose significant challenges for urban planning and service delivery.
