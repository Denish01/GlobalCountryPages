[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
South Africa has a well-developed transportation network, with most major cities having a range of options for getting around, including buses, minibus taxis, and commuter trains. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town having more comprehensive systems. However, many South Africans rely on private vehicles or minibus taxis to get around, particularly in rural areas where public transportation may be limited.

In terms of transportation costs, South Africa is a relatively affordable country to get around, with the cost of fuel, public transportation, and ride-hailing services comparable to or lower than many other countries. However, the cost of transportation can vary significantly depending on the city and the mode of transport, with some cities having more expensive options than others. For example, the cost of a monthly transit pass in Johannesburg may be higher than in smaller cities like Durban or Port Elizabeth.
