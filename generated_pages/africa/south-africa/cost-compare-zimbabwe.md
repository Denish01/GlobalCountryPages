South Africa and Zimbabwe are two neighboring countries in southern Africa with distinct economic profiles. South Africa has a more developed economy, with a strong services sector and a diverse range of industries, while Zimbabwe's economy has struggled in recent years due to hyperinflation and economic instability. As a result, South Africa tends to have a lower cost of living compared to Zimbabwe, with prices for everyday items such as food, housing, and transportation generally lower in South Africa. However, Zimbabwe's economy has shown signs of recovery in recent years, and the country offers a unique cultural and natural experience for visitors and expats.
