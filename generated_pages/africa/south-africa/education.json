Primary education, also known as **foundation phase**, lasts for seven years and is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 13. Secondary education, also known as **senior phase**, lasts for five years and is compulsory for all children between the ages of 14 and 18. Tertiary education, also known as **higher education**, includes universities, colleges, and vocational training institutions, and is not compulsory. The quality of education in South Africa varies greatly between public and private schools, with private schools generally offering higher quality education and better resources.\n\nThe public education system in South Africa is free and compulsory for all children, but it faces many challenges, including **poor infrastructure**, **inadequate resources**, and **high teacher absenteeism**. On the other hand, private schools in South Africa are known for their high academic standards and excellent resources, but they are expensive and inaccessible to many students. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of **outcomes-based education** and **national assessments**.\n\nDespite these challenges, South Africa has made significant progress in improving access to education, with **enrollment rates** increasing significantly over the past few decades.
