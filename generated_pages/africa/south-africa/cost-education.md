[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in South Africa is divided into public and private schools, with the former being generally free or low-cost, while the latter can be expensive. The language of instruction is usually one of the country's official languages, including **English**, **Afrikaans**, **Zulu**, and **Xhosa**. Compulsory education in South Africa lasts for 12 years, from age 7 to 18, and is divided into two phases: **General Education and Training** (GET) and **Further Education and Training** (FET). International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including **British**, **American**, and **International Baccalaureate**.

The quality of education in South Africa varies greatly between public and private schools, with the latter generally offering better facilities, smaller class sizes, and more experienced teachers. Public schools, on the other hand, often face challenges such as overcrowding, lack of resources, and inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, there are many excellent public schools in South Africa, particularly in urban areas. International schools, meanwhile, offer a high-quality education that is often comparable to that found in developed countries.
