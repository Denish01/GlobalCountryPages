[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in South Africa is relatively stable, with a mix of short-term and long-term lease options available. Typical lease terms range from 6-24 months, with a standard deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rental Housing Act**, which regulates the relationship between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, South Africa's housing costs are relatively high, but still more affordable than in many other countries. The country's housing market is also influenced by factors such as **urbanization** and **economic growth**, which can impact the demand for housing and drive up prices.

The housing market in South Africa is characterized by a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. This has led to an increase in informal settlements and backyard dwellings, which can be a challenge for low-income households. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the **National Housing Program**, which aims to provide affordable housing to low-income households. Despite these efforts, the housing market in South Africa remains complex and challenging, with many households struggling to access affordable and decent housing.
