[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The South African healthcare system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector providing healthcare services to the majority of the population, while the private sector caters to those who can afford it. The public sector is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost healthcare services to citizens, while the private sector is funded by medical insurance schemes and out-of-pocket payments. The quality of care varies significantly between the public and private sectors, with private hospitals and clinics generally offering higher standards of care. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where facilities and specialized care may be limited.

The public healthcare system in South Africa is facing several challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant progress in improving the healthcare system, including the introduction of the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, which aims to provide universal healthcare coverage to all citizens. The private healthcare sector, on the other hand, is well-developed and offers a wide range of specialized services, including advanced medical procedures and high-quality hospital care.

The quality of care in South Africa's healthcare system is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics meeting international standards. However, there are concerns about the high cost of private healthcare, which can be unaffordable for many citizens. The government has introduced regulations to control the cost of private healthcare, including the establishment of a pricing committee to regulate medical tariffs.
