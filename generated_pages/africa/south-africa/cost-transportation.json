The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town having more comprehensive systems. However, many South Africans rely on private vehicles or minibus taxis to get around, particularly in rural areas where public transportation may be limited.\n\nIn terms of transportation costs, South Africa is a relatively affordable country to get around, with the cost of fuel, public transportation, and ride-hailing services comparable to or lower than many other countries. However, the cost of transportation can vary significantly depending on the city and the mode of transport, with some cities having more expensive options than others. For example, the cost of a monthly transit pass in Johannesburg may be higher than in smaller cities like Durban or Port Elizabeth.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-$2 | $20-$30 | Good coverage in major cities, but less frequent in smaller towns |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Only available in Johannesburg, with limited routes |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$3 | N/A | Extensive network, but can be crowded and unreliable |\n| Commuter Train | $2-$5 | $30-$50 | Available in major cities, with relatively good coverage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3 | $1.50 | $10-$20 | Available in major cities, but can be more expensive than ride-hailing |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2 | $1 | $5-$15 | Uber and Bolt are widely available, with relatively affordable prices |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | Depending on the city and traffic conditions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Prices may vary depending on location and taxes |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | Prices may vary depending on location and taxes |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, with prices varying depending on the rental agency and location |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Prices may vary depending on the city and location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Depending on the route and distance traveled |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Depending on the route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$300 | Depending on the route and airline |\n| Train (long-distance) | $50-$200 | Depending on the route and class of service |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Bolt to get around cities, as they are often cheaper and more convenient than metered taxis.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for public transportation, as it can be more cost-effective than buying individual tickets.\n- Be aware of the cost of fuel and toll roads when driving, as they can add up quickly.\n- Use reputable bus companies for intercity travel, as they can be more affordable and comfortable than other options.\n- Always negotiate the fare with a taxi driver before starting your journey, as they may not always use a meter.\n- Be mindful of your belongings and surroundings when using public transportation, as petty crime can be a problem in some areas.",
