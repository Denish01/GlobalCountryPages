  "content": "The cost of healthcare in South Africa varies greatly between public and private facilities, with the latter offering higher quality services at a significantly higher cost, and the average health expenditure per capita being around $537.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $537\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 6.7%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 10177\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: ZAR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSouth Africa has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, while the private system is of a higher standard but more expensive. For locals, the public system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those with private insurance usually opt for the private system. The public system is funded by the government through taxes, and services are generally free or low-cost for citizens, while the private system is funded through private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments. It is recommended to have health insurance in South Africa, as medical costs can be high, especially in private facilities.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in South Africa's public and private sectors differs significantly. Public hospitals often face challenges such as limited resources, long waiting times, and a shortage of skilled staff, while private hospitals offer better facilities, more qualified staff, and shorter waiting times. However, the cost of private healthcare can be prohibitive for many, making it inaccessible to a large portion of the population. For foreigners, it is often recommended to opt for private healthcare, as the quality of care is generally higher and more reliable. Many private hospitals and medical facilities in South Africa are of international standard, and some even cater specifically to foreign patients.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$250 | Prices vary by specialty and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | Prices vary by dentist and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by optometrist and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by lab and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Prices vary by facility and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Hospital stays, basic procedures, and doctor visits |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Hospital stays, surgeries, specialist consultations, and more |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Emergency evacuations, hospital stays, and medical repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets.\n- Pharmacies are readily available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas.\n- A prescription from a licensed doctor is required for most medication.\n- Some pharmacies offer discounts for cash payments or loyalty programs.\n- Medication prices vary by brand, generic, and location, with prices often being higher in private hospitals and clinics.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number 10177 or visit the nearest hospital.
