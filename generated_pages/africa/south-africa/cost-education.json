The language of instruction is usually one of the country's official languages, including **English**, **Afrikaans**, **Zulu**, and **Xhosa**. Compulsory education in South Africa lasts for 12 years, from age 7 to 18, and is divided into two phases: **General Education and Training** (GET) and **Further Education and Training** (FET). International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including **British**, **American**, and **International Baccalaureate**.\n\nThe quality of education in South Africa varies greatly between public and private schools, with the latter generally offering better facilities, smaller class sizes, and more experienced teachers. Public schools, on the other hand, often face challenges such as overcrowding, lack of resources, and inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, there are many excellent public schools in South Africa, particularly in urban areas. International schools, meanwhile, offer a high-quality education that is often comparable to that found in developed countries.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 - $100 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Primary | $2,000 - $6,000 | Range by tier, from basic to elite |\n| Public Secondary | $100 - $500 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Secondary | $4,000 - $12,000 | Range by tier, from basic to elite |\n| International School | $8,000 - $20,000 | Curriculum types include British, American, and IB |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $2,000 - $5,000 | $5,000 - $10,000 | |\n| Private University | $5,000 - $10,000 | $10,000 - $20,000 | |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000 - $15,000 | $15,000 - $30,000 | University of Cape Town, University of Witwatersrand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100 - $500 | Varies by location and quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20 - $50 | Varies by subject and tutor experience |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100 - $300 | Varies by language and course level |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50 - $200 | Varies by school and grade level |\n| School Uniform | $50 - $200 | Varies by school and uniform quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **University of Cape Town** and **University of Witwatersrand** are two of the top-ranked universities in South Africa, offering a high-quality education to both local and international students.\n- **Scholarships** are available for students who excel academically, as well as for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n- **Online learning** options are becoming increasingly popular in South Africa, with many universities and colleges offering online courses and degree programs.\n- **International schools** are a good option for expat families, offering a high-quality education that is often comparable to that found in developed countries.\n- The **cost of living** in South Africa can be relatively high, particularly in urban areas, so it's essential to factor in living costs when planning your education budget.\n- **Language support** is available for students who are not fluent in one of the country's official languages, with many schools and universities offering language courses and support services.",
