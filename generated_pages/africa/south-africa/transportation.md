South Africa has several international airports, with OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and Cape Town International Airport being the main entry points.

For those traveling from within Africa, there are also several regional airports and border crossings that offer a more convenient and often more affordable way to enter South Africa. For example, you can fly into Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport, which is located near the famous Kruger National Park, or enter by land from Mozambique through the Lebombo Border Post.
