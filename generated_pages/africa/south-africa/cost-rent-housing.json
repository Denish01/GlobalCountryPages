Typical lease terms range from 6-24 months, with a standard deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rental Housing Act**, which regulates the relationship between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, South Africa's housing costs are relatively high, but still more affordable than in many other countries. The country's housing market is also influenced by factors such as **urbanization** and **economic growth**, which can impact the demand for housing and drive up prices.\n\nThe housing market in South Africa is characterized by a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. This has led to an increase in informal settlements and backyard dwellings, which can be a challenge for low-income households. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the **National Housing Program**, which aims to provide affordable housing to low-income households. Despite these efforts, the housing market in South Africa remains complex and challenging, with many households struggling to access affordable and decent housing.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | (typical quality, 20-30 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$450 | (what to expect, 40-60 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,200 | $400-$800 | (family size, 80-120 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,000-$2,000 | $700-$1,400 | (spacious, 150-200 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | (prime locations, e.g. **Sandton**, **Cape Town CBD**) |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,800 | (residential areas, e.g. **Johannesburg South**, **Cape Town Southern Suburbs**) |\n| Rural | $200-$800 | (if applicable, e.g. **farmhouses**, **small towns**) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Sandton**: a popular area for expats, with a range of amenities and a vibrant nightlife, typical rent range $800-$1,500 USD per month\n- **Cape Town CBD**: a central location with easy access to public transportation and amenities, typical rent range $600-$1,200 USD per month\n- **Johannesburg South**: a family-friendly area with good schools and amenities, typical rent range $400-$900 USD per month\n- **Cape Town Southern Suburbs**: a scenic area with a range of outdoor activities, typical rent range $500-$1,100 USD per month\n- **Pretoria East**: a quiet area with a mix of residential and commercial properties, typical rent range $300-$700 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for South Africa [/SECTION]\n- Research different neighborhoods and areas to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a rental property\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease\n- [CALLOUT] Be aware of scams and always inspect the property before signing a lease\n- Utilities such as electricity and water are usually not included in the rent, but may be included in some cases\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished apartments, but can be found in some areas, especially in **Cape Town** and **Johannesburg**",
