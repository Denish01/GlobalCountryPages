[SECTION] Overview: South Africa vs Kenya [/SECTION]
South Africa and Kenya are two distinct countries in Africa, each with its own unique culture, economy, and cost of living. South Africa is a more developed country with a stronger economy, which translates to a higher cost of living. The country has a diverse range of industries, including mining, manufacturing, and finance, which contributes to its higher GDP per capita. Kenya, on the other hand, is a developing country with a growing economy, primarily driven by agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The country's lower GDP per capita and lower cost of living make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists looking for an affordable African experience.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. South Africa's stronger economy and higher standard of living result in higher prices for goods and services, particularly in cities like Cape Town and Johannesburg. In contrast, Kenya's lower cost of living is reflected in its lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. Overall, Kenya is generally cheaper than South Africa, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living. This makes Kenya an excellent option for those looking for an affordable African experience, while South Africa is better suited for those who prioritize a higher standard of living and are willing to pay a premium for it.
