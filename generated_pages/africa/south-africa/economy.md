[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
South Africa has a diverse and upper-middle-income economy, driven by a mix of services, manufacturing, and mining sectors. The country has a well-developed financial system, a robust legal framework, and a highly developed infrastructure network. With a GDP per capita of approximately $4,700, South Africa is classified as an upper-middle-income economy by the World Bank. The economy has been experiencing a slow growth rate in recent years, partly due to a decline in commodity prices, high unemployment, and a lack of investment in key sectors.

The South African economy is characterized by a significant gap between the rich and the poor, with high levels of income inequality. The government has implemented various policies to address these challenges, including the National Development Plan, which aims to reduce poverty and inequality by 2030. The plan focuses on promoting economic growth, improving education and skills development, and enhancing the business environment. Despite these efforts, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate, which is estimated to be around 29%.

The economic trajectory of South Africa is closely tied to the global economy, particularly with regard to trade and investment. The country is a member of the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and has strong trade relationships with countries in the European Union, the United States, and China. The government has also implemented policies to promote economic diversification, including the development of the manufacturing and services sectors. These efforts aim to reduce the country's dependence on commodity exports and promote more sustainable and inclusive economic growth.
