The first indigenous people to inhabit the region were the **Khoisan**, who were later joined by **Bantu-speaking** peoples from central Africa. The Dutch established the first European settlement in 1652, and the British took control of the colony in 1806. The discovery of **gold** and **diamonds** in the late 19th century led to a significant influx of European settlers and the establishment of the **Boer Republics**.
