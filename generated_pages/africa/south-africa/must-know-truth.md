# The Truth About South Africa - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
South Africa has a complex and diverse history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the **Paleolithic Era**.

The Dutch established the first European settlement in 1652, and the British took control of the colony in 1806. The discovery of **gold** and **diamonds** in the late 19th century led to a significant influx of European settlers and the establishment of the **Boer Republics**.
