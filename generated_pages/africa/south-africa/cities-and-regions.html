        <h2>How South Africa Is Divided</h2>
        <p>South Africa is divided into 9 provinces, each with its own unique character and attractions. The provinces are further divided into municipalities, which are responsible for providing local services such as water, sanitation, and transportation.

This administrative structure allows for a balance of power between the national government and the provinces, enabling each region to address its specific needs and challenges.</p>
