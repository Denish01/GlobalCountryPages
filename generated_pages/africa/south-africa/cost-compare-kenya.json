  "content": "South Africa is generally more expensive than Kenya, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nSouth Africa GDP per Capita (PPP): $13,440\nKenya GDP per Capita (PPP): $4,330\nSouth Africa Inflation Rate: 4.6%\nKenya Inflation Rate: 5.3%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Kenya\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: South Africa vs Kenya [/SECTION]\nSouth Africa and Kenya are two distinct countries in Africa, each with its own unique culture, economy, and cost of living. South Africa is a more developed country with a stronger economy, which translates to a higher cost of living. The country has a diverse range of industries, including mining, manufacturing, and finance, which contributes to its higher GDP per capita. Kenya, on the other hand, is a developing country with a growing economy, primarily driven by agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The country's lower GDP per capita and lower cost of living make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists looking for an affordable African experience.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. South Africa's stronger economy and higher standard of living result in higher prices for goods and services, particularly in cities like Cape Town and Johannesburg. In contrast, Kenya's lower cost of living is reflected in its lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. Overall, Kenya is generally cheaper than South Africa, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living. This makes Kenya an excellent option for those looking for an affordable African experience, while South Africa is better suited for those who prioritize a higher standard of living and are willing to pay a premium for it.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | South Africa (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $450 | $250 | 44% cheaper in Kenya |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $250 | $150 | 40% cheaper in Kenya |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $800 | $500 | 37% cheaper in Kenya |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | South Africa (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $15 | $10 | 33% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $300 | $200 | 33% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Beer (500ml) | $5 | $3 | 40% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Coffee | $3 | $2 | 33% cheaper in Kenya |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | South Africa (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $50 | $20 | 60% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1.50 | $1 | 33% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1 | 17% cheaper in Kenya |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | South Africa (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $150 | $100 | 33% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $30 | 40% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Mobile Plan | $20 | $10 | 50% cheaper in Kenya |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | South Africa (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $1,200 | $800 | 33% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Mid-Range | $2,000 | $1,400 | 30% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Comfortable | $3,500 | $2,500 | 29% cheaper in Kenya |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **South Africa is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end shopping and luxury goods\n  - Fine dining and upscale restaurants\n  - International flights and travel\n  - High-quality healthcare and medical services\n- **Kenya is cheaper for:**\n  - Accommodation and housing\n  - Local transportation and taxis\n  - Food and groceries\n  - Mobile plans and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between South Africa and Kenya, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle and priorities.
