The cuisine is characterized by the use of fresh ingredients, bold spices, and traditional cooking methods, such as braaing (barbecuing) and stewing. The province's coastal location also means that seafood is a common feature of the local cuisine, with popular dishes including **fish braai** and **seafood curry**. Regional variations are also evident, with the north coast known for its sugar cane and citrus farms, and the south coast famous for its dairy farms and **amasi** (a type of sour milk).\n\nThe cuisine of KwaZulu-Natal is also shaped by its history, with many traditional dishes reflecting the province's cultural and economic exchanges with other parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia. For example, the popular dish **bunny chow** is believed to have originated among Indian laborers who came to the province in the late 19th century, and is now a staple of the local cuisine. The province's cuisine is also known for its use of **imbenge**, a type of fermented corn drink, and **umqombothi**, a type of traditional beer.\n\nOverall, KwaZulu-Natal's cuisine is a unique and flavorful reflection of the province's cultural diversity and geographic location, with a wide range of traditional dishes and modern fusion cuisine to try. From the spicy curries and **biryani** of the Indian community, to the **shisa nyama** (barbecued meat) and **umngqusho** (samp and beans) of the Zulu people, there is something for every palate and preference.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bunny Chow | curry dish | a hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with curry | Indian restaurants in Durban |\n| Shisa Nyama | barbecue | a traditional Zulu barbecue featuring grilled meat | township restaurants and braai spots |\n| Umngqusho | side dish | a traditional Zulu dish made with samp and beans | traditional Zulu restaurants |\n| Bryani | mixed rice dish | a flavorful dish made with a combination of spices, basmati rice, and meat or vegetables | Indian restaurants in Durban |\n| Fish Braai | seafood dish | a traditional seafood dish featuring grilled fish | coastal restaurants and braai spots |\n| Amasi | dairy product | a type of sour milk | dairy farms and supermarkets |\n| Imbenge | fermented drink | a traditional fermented corn drink | traditional Zulu restaurants and markets |\n| Umqombothi | traditional beer | a traditional beer made from fermented corn and sorghum | traditional Zulu restaurants and markets |\n| Malva Pudding | dessert | a sweet and sticky dessert made with apricot jam and served with a creamy sauce | Afrikaans restaurants and bakeries |\n| Bobotie | meat dish | a savory meat pie made with a mixture of ground beef and spices, topped with a custard-like egg mixture | Cape Malay restaurants |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Boerewors rolls**: a popular snack made with grilled sausage served in a roll, typically costing around $2-3 USD\n- **Samoosas**: a crispy fried or baked pastry filled with spiced potatoes and peas, typically costing around $1-2 USD\n- **Magwinya**: a type of fried doughnut, typically costing around $0.50-1 USD\n- **Kota**: a type of sandwich made with a hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with meat, cheese, and vegetables, typically costing around $3-4 USD\n- **Chakalaka**: a spicy tomato and onion relish, typically costing around $1-2 USD\n- **Mangoes**: a sweet and juicy fruit, typically costing around $1-2 USD\n- **Pap en vleis**: a traditional dish made with maize meal porridge and stewed meat, typically costing around $3-4 USD\n- **Walkie-talkies**: a type of fried chicken feet, typically costing around $2-3 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Umngqusho beer**: a traditional beer made from fermented corn and sorghum\n- **Imbenge**: a traditional fermented corn drink\n- **Amasi**: a type of sour milk\n- **Rooibos tea**: a caffeine-free tea made from the leaves of the rooibos plant\n- **Castle Lager**: a popular South African beer\n- **Stoney Ginger Beer**: a popular ginger beer\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- It is customary to eat with your right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean\n- It is polite to wait for the host to invite you to eat before starting your meal\n- It is customary to try a little of each dish, as a sign of respect for the cook\n- It is polite to finish your meal, as leaving food on your plate can be seen as impolite\n- It is customary to tip 10-15% of the total bill\n- Reservations are usually not necessary, but it is a good idea to call ahead to confirm availability\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional Zulu restaurants**: try **umngqusho** and **shisa nyama** at a traditional Zulu restaurant\n- **Indian restaurants**: try **bunny chow** and **biryani** at an Indian restaurant\n- **Seafood restaurants**: try fresh seafood at a coastal restaurant\n- **Markets**: try traditional snacks and drinks at a local market\n- **Food courts**: try a variety of dishes at a food court, including **boerewors rolls** and **samoosas**\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Durban's Victoria Street Market**: a bustling market featuring a wide range of traditional snacks and drinks\n- **The Neighbourgoods Market**: a popular market featuring artisanal foods and drinks\n- **The Shongweni Farmers' Market**: a market featuring fresh produce and dairy products\n- **The KwaZulu-Natal Food Festival**: an annual festival featuring traditional and modern cuisine from around the province\n- **The Zulu Cultural Village**: a cultural village featuring traditional Zulu cuisine and cooking demonstrations",
