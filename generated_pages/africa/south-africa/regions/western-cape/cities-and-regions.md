[SECTION] How Western Cape Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Western Cape is one of the nine provinces of South Africa and is divided into six districts, each with its own administrative center and unique characteristics. The districts are further divided into local municipalities, which are responsible for providing basic services such as water, sanitation, and roads to the local communities. The provincial government, based in Cape Town, is responsible for overseeing the overall development and administration of the province.

The Western Cape's administrative structure is designed to promote decentralization and community participation, with a strong emphasis on local economic development and job creation.
