[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Gauteng is situated in the northern part of South Africa, bordering the provinces of Free State to the south, North West to the west, Limpopo to the north, and Mpumalanga to the east. The province is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, but it is strategically located near the major ports of Durban and Richards Bay. The province's location at the intersection of several major highways and rail lines makes it a key transportation hub for the country.

The province's borders are marked by several notable geographical features, including the Vaal River to the south and the Magaliesberg Mountains to the north. The Highveld, a vast grassland plateau, covers much of the province, while the Witwatersrand, a ridge of hills and mountains, runs east-west through the center of the province. The province's location in the interior of the country means that it is far from the moderating influence of the ocean, resulting in a climate with significant temperature variations between summer and winter.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Gauteng's terrain is characterized by a mix of grasslands, savannas, and mountains. The Highveld, which covers much of the province, is a vast grassland plateau that stretches as far as the eye can see. The Magaliesberg Mountains, which form the northern border of the province, are a popular destination for hiking and outdoor recreation. The Witwatersrand, a ridge of hills and mountains that runs east-west through the center of the province, is home to several notable peaks, including the Suikerbosrand Ridge, the highest point in the province.

The province is also home to several major rivers, including the Vaal River, which forms the southern border of the province, and the Jukskei River, which flows through the city of Johannesburg. The rivers and streams of the province are an important source of water for the province's cities and industries, and they also support a wide range of aquatic life. The province's landscape is also dotted with numerous **koppies**, small hills of granite and other rocks that are a distinctive feature of the South African landscape.

The province's terrain has been shaped by millions of years of geological activity, including the formation of the Witwatersrand Basin, a large sedimentary basin that contains some of the richest gold deposits in the world. The basin, which stretches across much of the province, has been mined extensively for gold and other minerals, resulting in a landscape that is dotted with mine shafts and other mining infrastructure.
