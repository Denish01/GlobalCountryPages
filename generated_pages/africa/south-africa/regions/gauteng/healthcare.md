[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Gauteng's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector catering to the majority of the population. The public healthcare system in Gauteng is managed by the Gauteng Department of Health, which operates a network of hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. The quality of care in public facilities can vary, with some hospitals offering excellent care, while others may face challenges such as limited resources and long waiting times. In contrast, private healthcare providers in Gauteng offer high-quality care, with modern facilities and well-trained staff, but at a significantly higher cost. Urban areas in Gauteng tend to have better access to healthcare services, with a higher concentration of private hospitals and clinics, while rural areas often rely on public facilities, which may be limited in terms of resources and specialized care.

The public healthcare system in Gauteng is generally underfunded and overcrowded, which can lead to long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. However, the province has made significant strides in improving its healthcare infrastructure, with several new hospitals and clinics being built in recent years. The private healthcare sector, on the other hand, is well-developed, with several major hospital groups operating in the province, including **Netcare**, **Life Healthcare**, and **Mediclinic**. These groups offer a range of specialized services, including **cardiovascular surgery**, **oncology**, and **neurosurgery**.
