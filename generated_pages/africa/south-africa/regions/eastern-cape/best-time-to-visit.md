[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Eastern Cape has a diverse climate, with different regions experiencing varying weather patterns. The coastal areas have a mild oceanic climate, with warm summers and mild winters, while the inland regions have a more extreme climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The province experiences a dry season from May to August, with most of its rainfall occurring during the summer months. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time for game viewing and outdoor activities, while the wet season is ideal for birdwatching and seeing the region's lush vegetation.

The region's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the Drakensberg Mountains creating a rain shadow effect, resulting in a drier climate in the western parts of the province. The coastal regions, on the other hand, are prone to mist and fog, especially during the winter months. Understanding the climate and seasons is essential for planning a trip to Eastern Cape, as it can significantly impact the quality of your experience.

The province's climate is also characterized by strong winds, especially along the coast, which can make outdoor activities challenging during the winter months. However, the winds also bring cool air from the ocean, making the summers more pleasant. Overall, Eastern Cape's diverse climate and seasons offer a unique experience for visitors, with each season bringing its own set of attractions and activities.
