The public sector is managed by the Eastern Cape Department of Health, which operates hospitals, clinics, and community health centers throughout the province. The private sector, on the other hand, is made up of private hospitals, clinics, and medical practitioners who offer specialized care, often at a higher cost. The quality of care in Eastern Cape varies, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. Access to healthcare is also a challenge in rural areas, where residents may have to travel long distances to reach a hospital or clinic.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Eastern Cape is generally considered to be **underfunded** and **overburdened**, with long waiting times and limited resources. However, the private sector offers high-quality care, with many private hospitals and clinics equipped with modern facilities and staffed by skilled medical professionals. Despite these challenges, the Eastern Cape Department of Health has made efforts to improve the quality of care, including the implementation of new **healthcare policies** and the training of **healthcare workers**.\n\nIn terms of access to healthcare, urban areas such as Port Elizabeth and East London have a higher concentration of hospitals, clinics, and medical practitioners, making it easier for residents to access care.
