[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Eastern Cape region in South Africa has two main international airports, East London Airport and Port Elizabeth International Airport, which receive flights from major South African cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town, as well as some international flights. Direct flights are available from Johannesburg to East London and Port Elizabeth, making it convenient to travel to the region from within the country. For those traveling from outside South Africa, it's often necessary to fly into one of the country's major airports, such as OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg or Cape Town International Airport, and then take a domestic flight to the Eastern Cape. Overland entry points are also available for travelers coming from neighboring countries, such as Mozambique or Lesotho, with several border posts along the region's borders.

The main entry points by road are the N2 highway, which runs along the coast and connects the Eastern Cape to other parts of South Africa, and the N1 highway, which runs north-south through the center of the country. The region is also accessible by bus, with several companies offering services from major cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town. For travelers who prefer a more leisurely journey, there are also train services available, although these may be less frequent and less convenient than other modes of transport.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights are a convenient way to travel within South Africa and to the Eastern Cape region. Airlines such as **South African Airways**, **Mango**, and **FlySafair** operate flights from major cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town to East London and Port Elizabeth. The main routes are from Johannesburg to East London and Port Elizabeth, with several flights per day. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be high. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $50 to $200, depending on the airline, route, and time of booking. It's also a good idea to compare prices across different airlines and book online to get the best deals.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The rail network in the Eastern Cape region is limited, with most trains operated by **Shongololo Express** and **Transnet Freight Rail**.

Booking train tickets can be done online or at train stations, and it's recommended to book in advance, especially for long-distance journeys. Train travel can be a scenic and relaxing way to see the countryside, but it may not be the most convenient or efficient way to travel, especially for shorter journeys.
