The country has a population of 60.4 million people, with 11 official languages, including Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, and English. This linguistic diversity is a reflection of the country's history, with indigenous African languages, European colonial languages, and Asian and African immigrant languages all contributing to the cultural landscape.
