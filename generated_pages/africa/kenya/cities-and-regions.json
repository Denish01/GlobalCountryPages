These counties are further divided into sub-counties, wards, and locations. The county system was introduced in 2013, replacing the previous system of provinces and districts. The new system aims to promote decentralization and give more autonomy to local governments. Each county has its own government, led by a governor and a county assembly, which oversees the provision of services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.\n\nThe 47 counties in Kenya vary greatly in terms of size, population, and economic development. Some counties, such as Nairobi and Mombasa, are urbanized and economically developed, while others, such as Turkana and Marsabit, are rural and less developed. The county system has helped to promote regional development and address the unique needs of each area. However, it also faces challenges such as limited resources, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Nairobi** (4.7M)\nRole: capital, economic hub\nKnown For: Nairobi is a bustling metropolis with a mix of modern and traditional architecture, known for its vibrant cultural scene and wildlife attractions such as the Nairobi National Park.\nBest For: business travelers, tourists interested in culture and wildlife\n\n**Mombasa** (1.2M)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: Mombasa is a historic coastal city with a rich cultural heritage, known for its beautiful beaches, historic landmarks such as Fort Jesus, and vibrant nightlife.\nBest For: tourists looking for beach relaxation, cultural experiences, and nightlife\n\n**Kisumu** (400,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Kisumu is a city located on the shores of Lake Victoria, known for its natural beauty, cultural attractions such as the Kisumu Museum, and vibrant music scene.\nBest For: tourists interested in culture, nature, and outdoor activities\n\n**Nakuru** (300,000)\nRole: economic hub, agricultural center\nKnown For: Nakuru is a city located in the Rift Valley, known for its natural beauty, including Lake Nakuru National Park, and its vibrant agricultural sector.\nBest For: tourists interested in nature, outdoor activities, and agriculture\n\n**Eldoret** (250,000)\nRole: economic hub, agricultural center\nKnown For: Eldoret is a city located in the Rift Valley, known for its natural beauty, including the Cherangani Hills, and its vibrant agricultural sector.\nBest For: tourists interested in nature, outdoor activities, and agriculture\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rift Valley | semi-arid, agricultural | natural beauty, Lake Nakuru National Park | Nakuru |\n| Coast | coastal, tropical | beautiful beaches, historic landmarks | Mombasa |\n| Western | agricultural, rural | Lake Victoria, vibrant cultural scene | Kisumu |\n| Eastern | semi-arid, rural | natural beauty, wildlife reserves | Embu |\n| Central | mountainous, rural | natural beauty, coffee plantations | Nyeri |\n| Nairobi | urban, metropolitan | vibrant cultural scene, wildlife attractions | Nairobi |\n| North Eastern | arid, rural | natural beauty, nomadic culture | Garissa |\n| Lake Victoria | freshwater, rural | natural beauty, fishing industry | Homa Bay |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The Rift Valley region is known for its natural beauty, including Lake Nakuru National Park and the Cherangani Hills, and its vibrant agricultural sector.\n- The Coast region has a distinct cultural identity, with a mix of African, Arab, and European influences, and is known for its beautiful beaches and historic landmarks such as Fort Jesus.\n- The Western region is home to Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa, and has a vibrant cultural scene, with many traditional festivals and events.\n- The Eastern region is semi-arid and rural, with a strong focus on agriculture and livestock production, and is home to several wildlife reserves and national parks.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nKenya has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and roads connecting major cities and towns. The main airport is Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, which receives international flights from around the world. Domestic flights are available to many cities, including Mombasa, Kisumu, and Eldoret. The rail network is limited, but there are trains connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu.
