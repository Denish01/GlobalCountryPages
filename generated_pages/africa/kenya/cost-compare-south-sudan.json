Kenya has a relatively stable economy, with a growing middle class and a strong service sector, while South Sudan is one of the world's poorest countries, with a fragile economy heavily dependent on oil exports. The cost of living in Kenya is generally lower than in South Sudan, with prices for rent, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper. This is largely due to Kenya's more developed economy and infrastructure, which allows for greater efficiency and competition in the market.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in the cost of living difference. Kenya has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, while South Sudan's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which can be volatile and unpredictable. Additionally, Kenya has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, transportation systems, and amenities, which can make it easier and cheaper to live and work in the country.
