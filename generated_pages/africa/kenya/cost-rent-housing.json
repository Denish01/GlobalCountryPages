Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Kenya Rent Restriction Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to regional neighbors, Kenya's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in countries such as South Africa but higher than in countries such as Tanzania. The **inflation rate** of 4.5% (2024) and **health expenditure per capita** of $85 (2023) also impact the overall cost of living in Kenya.\n\nThe housing market in Kenya is also influenced by the country's economic growth, with a growing middle class driving demand for housing. However, the market is also characterized by a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this issue, including the development of **affordable housing** projects and the introduction of **rent control** measures. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Kenya remains challenging, with many tenants facing high rents and limited access to affordable housing options.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $150-$300 | Standard amenities, self-contained |\n| 2 Bedroom | $350-$600 | $250-$450 | Family size, additional amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$900 | $350-$600 | Spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, high-rise buildings |\n| Suburbs | $800-$2,000 | Residential areas, semi-detached houses |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | Agricultural land, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Westlands**: $300-$600 USD per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, known for its nightlife and entertainment options\n- **Kilimani**: $250-$500 USD per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, a popular area for young professionals and families\n- **Lavington**: $400-$800 USD per month for a 2-bedroom apartment, an upscale neighborhood with luxury amenities\n- **Runda**: $500-$1,000 USD per month for a 3-bedroom house, a secure and gated community with family-friendly facilities\n- **Muthaiga**: $600-$1,200 USD per month for a 3-bedroom house, a prestigious neighborhood with large gardens and scenic views\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Kenya [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to ensure safety and accessibility\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find suitable housing options\n- Negotiate rent and lease terms carefully, considering factors such as utilities and amenities\n- Be cautious of scams and ensure that the landlord or agent is legitimate\n- Utilities such as electricity and water are usually not included in the rent, and tenants are responsible for paying these bills separately\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Kenya, and tenants may need to provide their own furniture and appliances",
