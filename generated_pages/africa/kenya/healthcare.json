  "content": "Healthcare in Kenya is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services, although the quality of care and access to facilities can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: [RATING] 3/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nKenya's healthcare system is structured into several levels, including community health services, primary care facilities, and referral hospitals. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with the government operating a network of hospitals and health centers across the country. However, the private sector is also significant, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, particularly in urban areas. The quality of care in Kenya's healthcare system can vary, with some facilities providing excellent care, while others may be understaffed and under-equipped. Access to healthcare is generally better in urban areas, such as Nairobi, than in rural areas, where facilities may be more basic and harder to reach.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Kenya is generally underfunded and understaffed, which can lead to long waiting times and a lack of specialized care. In contrast, private facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive, making them inaccessible to many Kenyans. As a result, many people rely on traditional medicine or seek care from unqualified practitioners. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of **universal health coverage** and the expansion of health insurance schemes.\n\nDespite these challenges, Kenya has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with notable achievements in areas such as **maternal and child health** and **HIV/AIDS treatment**. The country has also invested in the development of its healthcare infrastructure, including the construction of new hospitals and the upgrading of existing facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aga Khan University Hospital | Nairobi | Private | Cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery | Yes |\n| Nairobi Hospital | Nairobi | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Kenyatta National Hospital | Nairobi | Public | General medicine, surgery, trauma | Yes |\n| Mombasa Hospital | Mombasa | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Gertrude's Children's Hospital | Nairobi | Private | Pediatrics, pediatric surgery | Yes |\n| Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital | Eldoret | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it provides access to better-equipped and staffed private facilities.\n- **National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)** is a government-sponsored scheme that provides health insurance coverage to Kenyan citizens.\n- **Private insurance companies**, such as AAR and Jubilee, offer a range of health insurance products, including individual and group plans.\n- **Expats** can purchase private health insurance from international companies, such as Bupa and Cigna.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the type of coverage and the provider, but a basic private health insurance plan can cost around KES 50,000-100,000 (USD 500-1,000) per year.\n- **Local insurance options** may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance companies, but can be more affordable.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Kenya, with many pharmacies and chemists operating in urban areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but many medications, including antibiotics and painkillers, can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands**, such as GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, are widely available, as well as generic alternatives.\n- **Costs** can vary, but many medications are relatively affordable, with prices starting from around KES 500 (USD 5).\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies operating in urban areas, including 24-hour pharmacies in major cities.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for travelers arriving from certain countries, including neighboring Tanzania and Uganda.\n- **Malaria** is a significant health risk in Kenya, particularly in rural areas, and travelers should take precautions, such as using insecticide-treated bed nets and taking antimalarial medication.\n- **HIV/AIDS** is prevalent in Kenya, and travelers should take precautions to avoid infection.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water and stick to bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat and raw vegetables.\n- **Cholera** and **typhoid** are also present in Kenya, and travelers should take precautions to avoid infection, such as avoiding contaminated food and water.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Kenya** is not a major medical tourism destination, but some private hospitals, such as the Aga Khan University Hospital, offer high-quality medical care at competitive prices.\n- **Popular procedures**, such as cosmetic surgery and orthopedic surgery, are available in some private hospitals.\n- **Accredited hospitals**, such as the Aga Khan University Hospital, have international accreditation, such as Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with some procedures costing up to 50% less than in Western countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, travelers should call the emergency number, 112, or seek assistance from a nearby hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can vary, but many private hospitals and clinics offer reliable ambulance services.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found using online directories or by asking locals for directions.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, and travelers should ensure they have the necessary documentation and contact information for their insurance provider.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, and travelers should ensure they have adequate insurance coverage for medical evacuation.",
