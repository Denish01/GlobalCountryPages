[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with most urban areas having access to electricity, water, and garbage collection services. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location and provider. The costs of utilities in Kenya have been relatively stable in recent years, but there can be some seasonal variation. For example, during the dry season, water costs may increase due to higher demand and lower supply. Additionally, electricity costs may fluctuate depending on the time of day and the level of demand.

The Kenyan government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure and reduce costs for consumers. For example, the government has implemented a **subsidy program** to reduce the cost of electricity for low-income households. Additionally, there are several private providers that offer competitive pricing and services, which can help to drive down costs and improve the overall quality of utility services in Kenya. The current **inflation rate** of 4.5% (2024) may have some impact on utility costs, but the overall effect is expected to be minimal.
