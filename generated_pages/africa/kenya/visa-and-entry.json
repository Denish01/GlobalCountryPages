[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nKenya has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of over 40 countries can enter Kenya visa-free, while many others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an electronic visa system. The country's visa policy aims to balance the need to facilitate tourism and business travel with the need to maintain national security and immigration controls.\n\nOverall, Kenya's visa policy is designed to be relatively welcoming to tourists and business travelers, while also ensuring that the country's immigration laws and regulations are respected. The government has introduced various measures to simplify the visa application process, including the introduction of an electronic visa system, which allows applicants to submit their applications online and receive their visas via email.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Must apply online prior to arrival |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Must apply online prior to arrival |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Must apply online prior to arrival, except for citizens of Ireland and Italy who can get visa on arrival |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Must apply online prior to arrival |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Must apply online prior to arrival |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Must apply online prior to arrival, and may require additional documentation |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Must apply online prior to arrival, and may require additional documentation |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Kenya for up to 90 days, and can apply for an electronic visa online prior to arrival.
