  "content": "Kenya is generally more expensive than Uganda, with a difference of around 15-20% in overall cost of living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nKenya GDP per Capita (PPP): 4,509\nUganda GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,566\nKenya Inflation Rate: 5.3%\nUganda Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Uganda\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Kenya vs Uganda [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Kenya and Uganda can vary significantly, with Kenya being the more expensive of the two. Kenya has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed economy, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Additionally, Kenya's inflation rate is higher than Uganda's, which can also drive up costs. However, both countries offer a unique cultural experience and a relatively low cost of living compared to other countries in the region.\n\nIn terms of overall cost of living, Uganda is generally around 15-20% cheaper than Kenya. This is due to a variety of factors, including lower housing costs, food prices, and transportation costs. However, it's worth noting that Kenya has a more developed economy and a wider range of amenities and services, which may be attractive to some expats and travelers. Uganda, on the other hand, offers a more laid-back and affordable lifestyle, with a lower cost of living and a more relaxed atmosphere.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Kenya (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 250 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 150 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 37.5% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Kenya (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 200 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Kenya (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 0.5 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1 | 16.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Kenya (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 80 | 20% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 20 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Kenya (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 500 | 37.5% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 800 | 33.3% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,500 | 25% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Kenya is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and dining experiences\n- Luxury accommodations and tourist amenities\n- Access to international flights and transportation\n- Business and financial services\n- **Uganda is cheaper for:**\n- Basic groceries and food staples\n- Local transportation and fuel\n- Budget accommodations and hostel stays\n- Outdoor activities and national park visits\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nThe choice between Kenya and Uganda ultimately depends on your individual priorities and lifestyle.

However, if you're on a tight budget or looking for a more laid-back and affordable lifestyle, Uganda is likely to be the more attractive option. For expats and travelers, Kenya's higher cost of living may be offset by its more developed infrastructure and wider range of services. For students and retirees, Uganda's lower cost of living and more relaxed atmosphere may be a better fit. Ultimately, both countries offer a unique and rewarding experience, and the decision will depend on your individual needs and priorities.",
