  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Kenya can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $100 to $200 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($150 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: KES\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nKenya's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with most urban areas having access to electricity, water, and garbage collection services. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location and provider. The costs of utilities in Kenya have been relatively stable in recent years, but there can be some seasonal variation. For example, during the dry season, water costs may increase due to higher demand and lower supply. Additionally, electricity costs may fluctuate depending on the time of day and the level of demand.\n\nThe Kenyan government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure and reduce costs for consumers. For example, the government has implemented a **subsidy program** to reduce the cost of electricity for low-income households. Additionally, there are several private providers that offer competitive pricing and services, which can help to drive down costs and improve the overall quality of utility services in Kenya. The current **inflation rate** of 4.5% (2024) may have some impact on utility costs, but the overall effect is expected to be minimal.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (mostly used for cooking) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in rent in some areas) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$140** | **$200** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Safaricom, Zuku |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | Liquid Telecom, Jamii Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Safaricom, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10-20 GB | Safaricom, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Safaricom, Zuku |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Showmax, which offers African content) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Kenya, it's best to contact the provider directly and provide proof of address and identification.\n- **Prepaid electricity** is a popular option in Kenya, as it allows consumers to control their usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- For internet services, **Safaricom** and **Zuku** are two of the most popular providers, offering a range of plans and packages.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using **energy-efficient appliances** and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It's also a good idea to **negotiate with your landlord** to see if they can include utility costs in the rent, or if they can provide any discounts or subsidies.",
