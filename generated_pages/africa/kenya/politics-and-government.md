[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Kenya is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President is both the head of state and head of government, and is responsible for appointing the Cabinet and other high-ranking officials. The **legislative branch** is a bicameral National Assembly, consisting of the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly has 349 seats, while the Senate has 67 seats. Members of the National Assembly are elected by the people for five-year terms, while Senators are elected for six-year terms. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court, among others.

The system of government in Kenya is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. This means that each branch has distinct powers and responsibilities, and is designed to provide checks and balances on the other branches. For example, the President has the power to appoint judges, but the National Assembly must approve the appointments. Similarly, the National Assembly has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto them.

Kenya is a **unitary state**, meaning that the central government has the ultimate authority and power to make decisions. However, the country is also divided into 47 **counties**, each with its own elected governor and assembly. The counties have a degree of autonomy and are responsible for providing certain services such as healthcare and education.
