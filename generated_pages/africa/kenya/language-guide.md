[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Kenya is diverse, with over 40 languages spoken across the country. **Swahili**, also known as Kiswahili, is the national language and is widely spoken by most Kenyans, while **English** is the language of business, education, and government. Regional dialects and minority languages are also prevalent, with languages like Kikuyu, Luhya, and Luo being spoken by various ethnic groups. English is understood by a significant portion of the population, particularly in urban areas and among those in the tourism industry, making it relatively easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the country.

Despite the diversity of languages, Swahili is the language that unites Kenyans, and it is commonly used in informal settings, such as markets and social gatherings. In addition, many Kenyans speak multiple languages, including their local dialect, Swahili, and English. This linguistic versatility has contributed to the country's rich cultural heritage and has facilitated communication among people from different regions and backgrounds.

Kenya's language policy aims to promote the use of Swahili and English, while also recognizing the importance of local languages and dialects. As a result, language education is an essential part of the country's curriculum, with students learning both Swahili and English from a young age. This emphasis on language education has contributed to the country's relatively high literacy rates and has enabled Kenyans to communicate effectively with people from other countries.
