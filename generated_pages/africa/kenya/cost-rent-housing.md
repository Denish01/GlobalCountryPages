[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Kenya is relatively competitive, with a high demand for housing, particularly in urban areas such as Nairobi. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Kenya Rent Restriction Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to regional neighbors, Kenya's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in countries such as South Africa but higher than in countries such as Tanzania. The **inflation rate** of 4.5% (2024) and **health expenditure per capita** of $85 (2023) also impact the overall cost of living in Kenya.

The housing market in Kenya is also influenced by the country's economic growth, with a growing middle class driving demand for housing. However, the market is also characterized by a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this issue, including the development of **affordable housing** projects and the introduction of **rent control** measures. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Kenya remains challenging, with many tenants facing high rents and limited access to affordable housing options.
