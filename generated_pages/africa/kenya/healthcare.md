[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya's healthcare system is structured into several levels, including community health services, primary care facilities, and referral hospitals. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with the government operating a network of hospitals and health centers across the country. However, the private sector is also significant, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, particularly in urban areas. The quality of care in Kenya's healthcare system can vary, with some facilities providing excellent care, while others may be understaffed and under-equipped. Access to healthcare is generally better in urban areas, such as Nairobi, than in rural areas, where facilities may be more basic and harder to reach.

The public healthcare system in Kenya is generally underfunded and understaffed, which can lead to long waiting times and a lack of specialized care. In contrast, private facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive, making them inaccessible to many Kenyans. As a result, many people rely on traditional medicine or seek care from unqualified practitioners. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of **universal health coverage** and the expansion of health insurance schemes.

Despite these challenges, Kenya has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with notable achievements in areas such as **maternal and child health** and **HIV/AIDS treatment**. The country has also invested in the development of its healthcare infrastructure, including the construction of new hospitals and the upgrading of existing facilities.
