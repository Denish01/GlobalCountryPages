[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
In Kenya, the main modes of transportation include **matatus** (minibuses), city buses, and taxis. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Nairobi having a more comprehensive network compared to other cities. Most people in Kenya get around using matatus or city buses, which are affordable and widely available. However, the roads in Kenya can be congested, especially in major cities like Nairobi and Mombasa, which can lead to increased travel times.

The transportation network in Kenya is also influenced by the country's geography, with many rural areas being inaccessible by public transportation. In these areas, people often rely on **boda bodas** (motorcycle taxis) or walking to get around. The government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of public transportation systems.
