The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) is responsible for administering taxes in Kenya, and taxpayers are required to register for a **Personal Identification Number (PIN)** to file tax returns and access other tax services. Taxpayers can register for a PIN online or at a KRA office, and must provide required documentation, such as a national ID or passport. The tax year in Kenya runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by June 30th of the following year.
