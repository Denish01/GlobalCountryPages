  "content": "The cost of education in Kenya varies widely, with public schools offering free or subsidized education, while private schools and international institutions charge higher fees, ranging from $100 to $10,000 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 4.0%\nLiteracy Rate: 78%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: KES\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nKenya's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector offering free or subsidized education to citizens. The quality of education in public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools in Kenya offer higher quality education, with better facilities and more experienced teachers. The language of instruction in Kenyan schools is English, with Swahili also being taught as a compulsory subject. Compulsory education in Kenya lasts for 12 years, from primary school to secondary school. International schools are also available in major cities like Nairobi, offering curricula such as the British GCSE, the American High School Diploma, and the International Baccalaureate.\n\nThe education system in Kenya is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards and overseeing the administration of schools. The ministry has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of free primary education and the establishment of a national education fund to support disadvantaged students. Despite these efforts, challenges persist, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to education in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$20 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Primary | $100-$500 | Range by tier, better facilities and teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $20-$100 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,000 | Range by tier, better facilities and teachers |\n| International School | $2,000-$10,000 | Curriculum types include British GCSE, American High School Diploma, and International Baccalaureate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $200-$500 | $500-$1,000 | |\n| Private University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$10,000 | University of Nairobi, Kenyatta University |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | English, Swahili, or other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **International School of Kenya** and **Hillcrest International School** are highly rated schools for expats, offering a range of curricula and extracurricular activities.\n- Scholarships are available for disadvantaged students, including the **Kenya Education Fund** and the **MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program**.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Kenya, with platforms like **Coursera** and **edX** offering a range of courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in Kenya is generally considered to be lower than in other East African countries, such as Rwanda and Tanzania, but higher than in some neighboring countries like Somalia and South Sudan.\n- **Language support** is available for international students, with many schools offering English language courses and support services.\n- The **Kenyan government** offers various initiatives to support education, including the **Free Primary Education** program and the **National Education Fund**, which provides financial support to disadvantaged students.",
