[SECTION] Overview: Kenya vs Uganda [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Kenya and Uganda can vary significantly, with Kenya being the more expensive of the two. Kenya has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed economy, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Additionally, Kenya's inflation rate is higher than Uganda's, which can also drive up costs. However, both countries offer a unique cultural experience and a relatively low cost of living compared to other countries in the region.

In terms of overall cost of living, Uganda is generally around 15-20% cheaper than Kenya. This is due to a variety of factors, including lower housing costs, food prices, and transportation costs.
