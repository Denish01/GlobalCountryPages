[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya's economy is a lower-middle-income economy, with a growing service sector and a significant agricultural industry. The country has experienced steady economic growth over the past decade, driven by a combination of factors including a growing middle class, increased investment in infrastructure, and a favorable business environment. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a large informal sector, high unemployment, and a reliance on a few key export commodities. Kenya's economic development level is classified as lower-middle, with a GDP per capita of approximately $2,010.

The country's economy has been on a positive trajectory, with the service sector being the main driver of growth. The service sector accounts for approximately 50% of the country's GDP, followed by agriculture and manufacturing. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote economic growth, including the development of special economic zones and the implementation of policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the economy is still vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in weather patterns that can impact agricultural production.

Kenya's economic classification is as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The government plays a significant role in the economy, particularly in strategic sectors such as energy and transportation. However, the private sector is also a key driver of growth, with many Kenyan companies competing successfully in regional and international markets. The country's economic outlook is positive, with the government forecasting growth of around 6% per annum over the next few years.
