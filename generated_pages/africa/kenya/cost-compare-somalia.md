[SECTION] Overview: Kenya vs Somalia [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Kenya and Somalia varies significantly, with Kenya being the more developed and economically stable of the two countries. Kenya has a diverse economy with a strong service sector, a growing manufacturing industry, and a significant tourism sector, which contributes to its relatively higher GDP per capita. In contrast, Somalia has faced decades of conflict and instability, which has hindered its economic development and resulted in a lower GDP per capita. As a result, Kenya tends to have higher prices for certain goods and services, particularly in the capital city of Nairobi, but overall it remains cheaper than Somalia.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Kenya has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, transportation, and communication systems, which makes it easier and cheaper to live and do business in the country. Somalia, on the other hand, has limited infrastructure and a largely informal economy, which can make it more expensive to access basic goods and services. Overall, Kenya is generally cheaper than Somalia, with a cost of living difference of around 20-30% in favor of Kenya. However, the cost of living in both countries can vary significantly depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

For expats and tourists, Kenya is generally the better choice, with its more developed infrastructure, wider range of amenities, and relatively lower cost of living.
