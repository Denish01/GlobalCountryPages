[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with public facilities generally offering more affordable services, but often with longer wait times and limited resources. Private facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. The system is generally well-organized, with a clear referral process from primary care to specialized care. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the facility and location. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.

In terms of accessibility, public healthcare facilities are generally more widespread, especially in rural areas, while private facilities are mostly concentrated in urban areas like Nairobi and Mombasa. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek private care, as the quality of care is generally higher and more tailored to international standards. Many private facilities also have international accreditation and offer a range of specialized services. However, it is essential to note that even in private facilities, the cost of care can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific services required.
