[SECTION] Overview: Kenya vs Tanzania [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Kenya and Tanzania can vary significantly, depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences. Kenya has a more developed economy, with a stronger service sector and a more diverse range of industries, which can drive up costs in certain areas, such as housing and transportation. However, overall, Kenya tends to be cheaper than Tanzania, with lower prices for food, utilities, and other essentials. Tanzania, on the other hand, has a more rural economy, with a greater emphasis on agriculture, which can make it more expensive for certain items, such as meat and dairy products.

In terms of economic context, both countries have experienced significant growth in recent years, with Kenya's economy growing at an average rate of 5-6% per year, and Tanzania's economy growing at an average rate of 6-7% per year. However, Kenya's economy is more diversified, with a stronger manufacturing sector and a more developed tourism industry, which can make it more attractive to expats and foreign investors. Tanzania, on the other hand, has a more natural resource-based economy, with a greater emphasis on mining and agriculture, which can make it more vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.
