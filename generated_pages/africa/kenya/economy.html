        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Kenya's economy is a lower-middle-income economy, with a growing service sector and a significant agricultural industry. The country has experienced steady economic growth over the past decade, driven by a combination of factors including a growing middle class, increased investment in infrastructure, and a favorable business environment. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a large informal sector, high unemployment, and a reliance on a few key export commodities. Kenya's economic development level is classified as lower-middle, with a GDP per capita of approximately $2,010.</p>
        <p>The country's economy has been on a positive trajectory, with the service sector being the main driver of growth. The service sector accounts for approximately 50% of the country's GDP, followed by agriculture and manufacturing. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote economic growth, including the development of special economic zones and the implementation of policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the economy is still vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in weather patterns that can impact agricultural production.</p>
        <p>Kenya's economic classification is as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The government plays a significant role in the economy, particularly in strategic sectors such as energy and transportation. However, the private sector is also a key driver of growth, with many Kenyan companies competing successfully in regional and international markets. The country's economic outlook is positive, with the government forecasting growth of around 6% per annum over the next few years.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Trading Partners:</strong> Uganda, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and China.

The country's development priorities include the promotion of manufacturing, the development of the tourism sector, and the expansion of the IT sector. The government has also implemented a number of major projects, including the development of a new railway line from Mombasa to Nairobi and the expansion of the port of Mombasa. The country is also a key player in regional trade agreements, including the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which is expected to increase trade and investment opportunities for Kenyan businesses.</p>
        <p>The government has also implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the business environment, including the introduction of a new company law and the establishment of a business registry. The country has also made significant progress in the area of financial inclusion, with over 80% of the population having access to a bank account or mobile money service. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a large informal sector and high levels of unemployment.
