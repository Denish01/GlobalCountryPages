The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional housing options, with prices varying widely depending on location, size, and amenities. In urban areas such as Nairobi, the demand for housing is high, and the market is dominated by apartments and townhouses. In contrast, rural areas tend to have more traditional housing options, such as single-family homes and farmhouses. The price trajectory of the Kenyan property market has been upward, with prices increasing by around 10-15% per annum in recent years.\n\nThe current market conditions are favorable for investors, with a range of financing options available and a relatively stable economy. However, the market is not without its challenges, and investors need to be aware of the risks associated with investing in Kenya, including corruption, bureaucracy, and infrastructure challenges. Despite these challenges, the Kenyan property market offers a range of opportunities for investors, from luxury apartments in Nairobi to commercial properties in Mombasa.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is also a key factor in the Kenyan property market, with urban areas tend to have more modern and expensive housing options, while rural areas tend to have more traditional and affordable options. This divide is driven by a range of factors, including access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. As a result, investors need to carefully consider the location and type of property they invest in, as well as the local market conditions and trends.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nairobi | 1,200 | 500-1,000 | Apartment |\n| Mombasa | 800 | 300-600 | Townhouse |\n| Kisumu | 600 | 200-400 | Single-family home |\n| Eldoret | 500 | 150-300 | Farmhouse |\n| Nakuru | 400 | 100-200 | Apartment |\n| Malindi | 350 | 80-150 | Beach house |\n| Thika | 300 | 60-120 | Townhouse |\n| Machakos | 250 | 40-80 | Single-family home |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Kenya, but they must comply with the country's laws and regulations, including registering with the Kenya Revenue Authority and obtaining a PIN number.\n- Foreigners can own property in their own name, but they may also consider using a company structure or leasehold agreement to minimize taxes and bureaucratic hurdles.\n- Foreigners must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning to purchase property, and they must also comply with the country's foreign exchange regulations.\n- Foreigners are subject to the same property taxes and rates as Kenyan citizens, and they must also comply with the country's environmental and zoning regulations.\n- Foreigners should seek the advice of a qualified lawyer or real estate agent to ensure they comply with all the necessary laws and regulations.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
