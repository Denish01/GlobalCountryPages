  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Kenya varies significantly between public and private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $85, and out-of-pocket health spend accounting for 24.2% of total health expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $85\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 24.2%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: KES\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nKenya's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with public facilities generally offering more affordable services, but often with longer wait times and limited resources. Private facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. The system is generally well-organized, with a clear referral process from primary care to specialized care. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the facility and location. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.\n\nIn terms of accessibility, public healthcare facilities are generally more widespread, especially in rural areas, while private facilities are mostly concentrated in urban areas like Nairobi and Mombasa. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek private care, as the quality of care is generally higher and more tailored to international standards. Many private facilities also have international accreditation and offer a range of specialized services. However, it is essential to note that even in private facilities, the cost of care can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific services required.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by location and doctor's expertise |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by location and dentist's expertise |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by location and optometrist's expertise |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-$10 | $10-$20 | Prices vary by location and lab facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and services required |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and room type |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$500 | Prices vary by type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$300 | Prices vary by hospital and services required |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-$20 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers medical services worldwide, including evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications like **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-$10 per prescription.\n- Prescription medications like **insulin** and **asthma inhalers** can cost between $10-$20 per month.\n- Over-the-counter medications like **cold and flu remedies** can cost between $5-$10 per pack.\n- Pharmacy services are widely available in urban areas, but can be limited in rural areas.\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration dates and authenticity of medications before purchase.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 112, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.
