However, there is a significant urban-rural divide in terms of internet access, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in major cities like Nairobi and Mombasa, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in Kenya can also be affected by factors such as weather conditions, power outages, and maintenance of the network infrastructure.\n\nDespite these challenges, Kenya has made significant progress in expanding its internet infrastructure in recent years, with a growing number of internet service providers and a range of options for accessing the internet, including mobile networks, fiber-optic cables, and satellite connections. This has helped to increase internet penetration rates, with more Kenyans than ever before having access to the internet, and has also driven down prices, making it more affordable for people to get online.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Kenya, you can visit a store or kiosk of one of the main carriers, such as Safaricom, Airtel, or Telkom, and purchase a tourist SIM card for around 10 USD. You will need to provide a valid passport and fill out a registration form to activate the SIM card. The registration process typically takes a few minutes, and you will need to provide your passport details and a local address. Once you have purchased and registered your SIM card, you can choose from a range of data plans, including prepaid and postpaid options, with prices starting from around 1 USD per day for 100 MB of data.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Safaricom | Safari | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 24 hours |\n| Airtel | UnlimiNET | 5 GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Telkom | Freedom | 10 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Orange | Holiday | 2 GB | 10 | Valid for 14 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many hotels and resorts offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is also widespread, with many cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular in major cities, offering reliable and fast WiFi connections\n- Public WiFi is available in some areas, such as airports and shopping malls, but can be slow and unreliable\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi to customers, making it easy to stay connected while on the go\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Nairobi Garage and The Foundry offer reliable and fast WiFi connections, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and networking events\n- Reliable cafe chains like Java House and Artcaffe offer good WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and portable WiFi routers can be useful in case of an outage or slow connection\n- VPNs can be necessary to access certain websites and services that are blocked in Kenya\n- Online communities like Nomad List and Remote Year can provide valuable resources and support for remote workers in Kenya\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Kenya, with some websites and services blocked by the government\n- Blocked sites include some **VPN** services and **torrenting** websites\n- Using a **VPN** can help to bypass these restrictions and access blocked content\n- Roaming alternatives like **eSIM** cards and **international SIM cards** can be a good option for travelers who need to stay connected while on the go\n- Be aware of **cybersecurity** risks like phishing and malware, and take steps to protect yourself and your devices while online\n- **Public WiFi** can be slow and unreliable, and may not be secure, so it's a good idea to use a **VPN** when accessing public WiFi networks.",
