Primary education, also known as **basic education**, is compulsory for all children and lasts for eight years, from age six to fourteen. Secondary education, also known as **high school**, lasts for four years, from age fourteen to eighteen, and is divided into two cycles: two years of lower secondary and two years of upper secondary. Tertiary education, also known as **higher education**, includes universities, colleges, and vocational training institutions, and offers a wide range of academic programs, including **bachelor's**, **master's**, and **doctoral degrees**.\n\nThe quality of education in Kenya varies between public and private institutions. Public schools, also known as **government schools**, are generally less expensive but often lack resources and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, offer higher quality education but are often expensive and inaccessible to many Kenyans. Despite these challenges, Kenya has made significant progress in improving its education system, with a growing number of students accessing education and completing their studies.\n\nThe Kenyan government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of **free primary education** and the development of **national curriculum** standards.
