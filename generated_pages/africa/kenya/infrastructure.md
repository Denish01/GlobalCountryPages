[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a notable gap between urban and rural areas. The government has invested heavily in recent years to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications. The country's strategic location and growing economy have made it an attractive destination for foreign investment, with many international companies setting up operations in Kenya. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure development, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation is limited.

The Kenyan government has launched several initiatives to address the country's infrastructure gap, including the **Vision 2030** development plan, which aims to transform Kenya into a middle-income country by 2030. The plan includes significant investments in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, railways, and energy generation facilities. The government has also established the **National Transport and Safety Authority** to regulate and oversee the country's transport sector, and the **Energy Regulatory Commission** to regulate the energy sector.

Despite these efforts, Kenya's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including congestion, inefficiency, and lack of access to basic services in rural areas. The country's roads are often congested, particularly in urban areas, and the rail network is limited. The energy sector is also facing challenges, with frequent power outages and a reliance on expensive and polluting diesel generators. However, the government is working to address these challenges, with a focus on increasing access to renewable energy and improving the efficiency of the energy sector.
