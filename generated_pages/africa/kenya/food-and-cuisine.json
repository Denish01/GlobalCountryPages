The cuisine is characterized by the use of local ingredients such as corn, beans, and vegetables, as well as the incorporation of international spices and flavors. Regional variations in Kenyan cuisine are notable, with different communities having their own unique dishes and cooking styles. For example, the coastal region is known for its seafood dishes, while the western region is famous for its **Luhya** dishes, which feature corn and beans as main ingredients.\n\nThe cuisine in Kenya is also shaped by the country's history, with the introduction of new crops and cooking techniques by European colonizers and Arab traders. Today, Kenyan cuisine is a vibrant and eclectic mix of traditional and modern flavors, with popular dishes like **Chapati** (flatbread) and **Mandazi** (fried doughnuts) being enjoyed by people from all walks of life. The cuisine is also influenced by the country's geography, with the fertile highlands and coastal regions providing a wide range of fresh produce and seafood.\n\nKenyan cuisine is not just about the food, but also about the social and cultural context in which it is consumed. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and the sharing of food is an important aspect of Kenyan hospitality. In many Kenyan communities, food is also an integral part of traditional ceremonies and celebrations, such as weddings and festivals.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ugali | Main Course | Cornmeal dish served with stewed greens or meat | Local restaurants, markets |\n| Sukuma Wiki | Side Dish | Stewed greens made with kale or collard greens | Local restaurants, markets |\n| Nyama Choma | Main Course | Roasted meat (usually beef, goat, or chicken) served with vegetables | Local restaurants, markets |\n| Matooke | Side Dish | Steamed or boiled green bananas | Local restaurants, markets |\n| Chapati | Bread | Flatbread made with wheat flour | Local markets, street food vendors |\n| Mandazi | Dessert | Fried doughnuts sprinkled with sugar | Local markets, street food vendors |\n| Kachumbari | Salad | Tomato and onion salad made with cilantro and chili peppers | Local restaurants, markets |\n| Githeri | Main Course | Bean and corn stew made with vegetables and spices | Local restaurants, markets |\n| Matoke | Main Course | Steamed or boiled green bananas served with vegetables and meat | Local restaurants, markets |\n| Biriyani | Main Course | Mixed rice dish made with meat or vegetables and spices | Local restaurants, markets |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Mandazi** (fried doughnuts): 0.50 USD\n- **Chapati** (flatbread): 0.25 USD\n- **Kachumbari** (tomato and onion salad): 1.00 USD\n- **Githeri** (bean and corn stew): 1.50 USD\n- **Roasted corn**: 0.25 USD\n- **Fried cassava**: 0.50 USD\n- **Samosas** (fried or baked pastry): 0.50 USD\n- **Viazi karai** (fried potato wedges): 1.00 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Tusker** (local beer): 2.00 USD\n- **Krest** (local soda): 1.00 USD\n- **Fresh juice** (made with local fruits): 2.00 USD\n- **Chai** (black tea): 0.50 USD\n- **Maziwa** (fermented milk): 1.00 USD\n- **Fresh coconut water**: 1.00 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- It is customary to wash your hands before eating\n- Use your right hand when eating with your hands\n- It is considered impolite to eat with your left hand\n- Try a little of each dish to show appreciation for the food\n- Burping is considered impolite, so try to excuse yourself if you need to burp\n- Tipping is not mandatory, but 10% of the total bill is appreciated\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local restaurants**: try traditional Kenyan dishes like Ugali and Sukuma Wiki\n- **Markets**: find fresh produce, meat, and spices, as well as street food vendors\n- **Food courts**: try a variety of local and international dishes\n- **High-end restaurants**: enjoy fine dining and international cuisine\n- **Street food vendors**: try popular snacks like Mandazi and Chapati\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **City Market** (Nairobi): try local fruits, vegetables, and spices\n- **Kibera Market** (Nairobi): find fresh produce and meat, as well as street food vendors\n- **Mombasa Old Town** (Mombasa): try traditional coastal dishes like seafood and biriyani\n- **Lake Nakuru National Park** (Nakuru): enjoy game meat and traditional Kenyan cuisine\n- **Kisumu Market** (Kisumu): find fresh produce and fish from Lake Victoria",
