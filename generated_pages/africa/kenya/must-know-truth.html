        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Kenya, a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in <strong>Africa</strong>, has a rich and diverse history. The country's strategic location on the eastern coast of Africa made it an attractive spot for trade and settlement. The earliest inhabitants of Kenya were indigenous groups, including the <strong>Kikuyu</strong>, <strong>Luhya</strong>, and <strong>Maasai</strong>. In the 19th century, Kenya became a British <strong>protectorate</strong>, and in 1895, it was declared a British <strong>colony</strong>. The country gained its independence on December 12, 1963, with <strong>Jomo Kenyatta</strong> as its first president. Kenya became a republic on December 12, 1964, with Kenyatta as its first president. The country has a <strong>presidential system</strong> of government, with the president serving as both the head of state and head of government.</p>
        <p>The colonial period had a significant impact on Kenya's development, with the British introducing <strong>cash crops</strong> such as coffee and tea, and investing in <strong>infrastructure</strong> such as roads and railways. The country's economy grew rapidly during this period, but the benefits of growth were not evenly distributed, with many Kenyans remaining poor and marginalized. After independence, Kenya faced significant challenges, including poverty, inequality, and ethnic tensions. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with economic growth and development, but still faces many challenges.</p>
        <p>Kenya's history is also marked by its struggle for independence, with key figures such as <strong>Jomo Kenyatta</strong> and <strong>Dedan Kimathi</strong> playing important roles. The country's independence movement was marked by violence and repression, with many Kenyans killed or imprisoned by the British. The <strong>Mau Mau</strong> rebellion, which took place from 1952 to 1960, was a key event in Kenya's struggle for independence. The rebellion was led by the <strong>Kenya Land and Freedom Army</strong>, a militant group that sought to end British colonial rule.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Kenya has continued to evolve and develop, with a growing economy and a diverse culture. The country has a <strong>multi-party system</strong>, with several political parties competing for power. The <strong>Constitution of Kenya</strong>, which was adopted in 2010, provides for a <strong>devolved system</strong> of government, with power divided between the national government and county governments.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Kenya is a desert country with no access to water"</p>
        <p>Reality: Kenya has a diverse geography, with <strong>mountains</strong>, <strong>forests</strong>, and <strong>coastal regions</strong>, and has access to several major rivers, including the <strong>Tana River</strong> and the <strong>Nile River</strong>. While some parts of the country are arid, Kenya has a significant amount of rainfall and has made significant investments in <strong>irrigation</strong> and <strong>water management</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All Kenyans are poor and live in slums"</p>
        <p>Reality: While poverty is a significant challenge in Kenya, the country has a <strong>growing middle class</strong>, with many Kenyans living in <strong>urban areas</strong> such as <strong>Nairobi</strong> and <strong>Mombasa</strong>, and enjoying a relatively high standard of living. Kenya is also home to a number of <strong>wealthy individuals</strong> and <strong>businesses</strong>, and has a <strong>diversified economy</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>

Visitors can take <strong>normal precautions</strong> to stay safe, such as avoiding traveling at night and using reputable transportation services. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Kenya's economy is based solely on agriculture"</p>
        <p>Reality: While <strong>agriculture</strong> is an important sector of Kenya's economy, the country has a <strong>diversified economy</strong>, with significant contributions from <strong>manufacturing</strong>, <strong>tourism</strong>, and <strong>services</strong>. Kenya is also a major <strong>regional trade hub</strong>, with the <strong>Port of Mombasa</strong> serving as a key entry point for goods into the region. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All Kenyans speak Swahili"</p>
        <p>Reality: While <strong>Swahili</strong> is an official language of Kenya, the country has a <strong>diverse language landscape</strong>, with over 40 languages spoken. <strong>English</strong> is also an official language, and is widely spoken, particularly in business and education. Many Kenyans speak multiple languages, including their local language, Swahili, and English. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Kenya is a homogeneous culture"</p>
