# Kenya Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Kenya before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of over 40 countries can enter Kenya visa-free, while many others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an electronic visa system. The country's visa policy aims to balance the need to facilitate tourism and business travel with the need to maintain national security and immigration controls.

Overall, Kenya's visa policy is designed to be relatively welcoming to tourists and business travelers, while also ensuring that the country's immigration laws and regulations are respected. The government has introduced various measures to simplify the visa application process, including the introduction of an electronic visa system, which allows applicants to submit their applications online and receive their visas via email.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The main airports in Kenya are Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi and Moi International Airport in Mombasa. Land borders are also open, with major border crossings at Namanga, Loitokitok, and Lunga Lunga. Upon arrival, visitors will need to present their passport, visa (if required), and completed arrival/departure card to immigration officials. The immigration process can take some time, especially during peak travel seasons, so it's a good idea to arrive early and be patient.

Kenya has introduced an electronic immigration system, which allows visitors to fill out their arrival/departure cards online prior to arrival. This can help speed up the immigration process, but it's still important to ensure that all required documents are in order before arrival.

[SECTION] Common Mistakes To Avoid [/SECTION]
- Not applying for a visa in advance, if required
- Not having a valid passport with at least six months' validity
- Not providing proof of sufficient funds
- Not having a yellow fever vaccination certificate, if traveling from a high-risk country
- Not having a police certificate, if required by the Kenyan embassy or consulate
