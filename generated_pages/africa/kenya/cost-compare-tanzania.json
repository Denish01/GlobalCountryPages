  "content": "Kenya is generally cheaper than Tanzania, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nKenya GDP per Capita (PPP): 4,330\nTanzania GDP per Capita (PPP): 3,280\nKenya Inflation Rate: 5.3%\nTanzania Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Kenya\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Kenya vs Tanzania [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Kenya and Tanzania can vary significantly, depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences. Kenya has a more developed economy, with a stronger service sector and a more diverse range of industries, which can drive up costs in certain areas, such as housing and transportation. However, overall, Kenya tends to be cheaper than Tanzania, with lower prices for food, utilities, and other essentials. Tanzania, on the other hand, has a more rural economy, with a greater emphasis on agriculture, which can make it more expensive for certain items, such as meat and dairy products.\n\nIn terms of economic context, both countries have experienced significant growth in recent years, with Kenya's economy growing at an average rate of 5-6% per year, and Tanzania's economy growing at an average rate of 6-7% per year. However, Kenya's economy is more diversified, with a stronger manufacturing sector and a more developed tourism industry, which can make it more attractive to expats and foreign investors. Tanzania, on the other hand, has a more natural resource-based economy, with a greater emphasis on mining and agriculture, which can make it more vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Kenya (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 500 | 25% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 200 | 250 | 25% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 1,000 | 25% more expensive in Tanzania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Kenya (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 12 | 20% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 60 | 20% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 50% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 100% more expensive in Tanzania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Kenya (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 50% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 1.5 | 50% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1 | 1.2 | 20% more expensive in Tanzania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Kenya (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 60 | 20% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 33% more expensive in Tanzania |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 50% more expensive in Tanzania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Kenya (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 600 | 17% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Mid-Range | 1,000 | 1,200 | 17% cheaper in Kenya |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 2,400 | 17% cheaper in Kenya |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Kenya is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices 25% lower than in Tanzania\n  - Food and dining, with prices 20% lower than in Tanzania\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices 20% lower than in Tanzania\n  - Monthly transit passes, with prices 33% lower than in Tanzania\n- **Tanzania is cheaper for:**\n  - Fuel, with prices 10% lower than in Kenya\n  - Taxi fares, with prices 10% lower than in Kenya\n  - Mobile plans, with prices 10% lower than in Kenya\n  - Certain types of groceries, such as meat and dairy products, which can be 10-20% cheaper than in Kenya\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Kenya is generally the better value, with lower costs for housing, food, and transportation. However, Tanzania can be a better option for those who prioritize natural beauty and outdoor activities, with its stunning national parks and game reserves. For families, Kenya may be the better choice, with a more developed education system and a wider range of amenities and activities. Ultimately, the choice between Kenya and Tanzania will depend on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences. Kenya's more developed economy and lower costs make it an attractive option for many, but Tanzania's natural beauty and cultural heritage make it a unique and rewarding destination in its own right.",
