[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector offering free or subsidized education to citizens. The quality of education in public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools in Kenya offer higher quality education, with better facilities and more experienced teachers. The language of instruction in Kenyan schools is English, with Swahili also being taught as a compulsory subject. Compulsory education in Kenya lasts for 12 years, from primary school to secondary school. International schools are also available in major cities like Nairobi, offering curricula such as the British GCSE, the American High School Diploma, and the International Baccalaureate.

The education system in Kenya is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards and overseeing the administration of schools. The ministry has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of free primary education and the establishment of a national education fund to support disadvantaged students. Despite these efforts, challenges persist, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to education in rural areas.
