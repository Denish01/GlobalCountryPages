[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya's internet quality is generally good, with an average internet speed of 10 Mbps download, making it suitable for streaming, online browsing, and social media. However, there is a significant urban-rural divide in terms of internet access, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in major cities like Nairobi and Mombasa, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in Kenya can also be affected by factors such as weather conditions, power outages, and maintenance of the network infrastructure.

Despite these challenges, Kenya has made significant progress in expanding its internet infrastructure in recent years, with a growing number of internet service providers and a range of options for accessing the internet, including mobile networks, fiber-optic cables, and satellite connections. This has helped to increase internet penetration rates, with more Kenyans than ever before having access to the internet, and has also driven down prices, making it more affordable for people to get online.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Kenya, you can visit a store or kiosk of one of the main carriers, such as Safaricom, Airtel, or Telkom, and purchase a tourist SIM card for around 10 USD. You will need to provide a valid passport and fill out a registration form to activate the SIM card. The registration process typically takes a few minutes, and you will need to provide your passport details and a local address. Once you have purchased and registered your SIM card, you can choose from a range of data plans, including prepaid and postpaid options, with prices starting from around 1 USD per day for 100 MB of data.
