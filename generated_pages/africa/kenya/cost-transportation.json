The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Nairobi having a more comprehensive network compared to other cities. Most people in Kenya get around using matatus or city buses, which are affordable and widely available. However, the roads in Kenya can be congested, especially in major cities like Nairobi and Mombasa, which can lead to increased travel times.\n\nThe transportation network in Kenya is also influenced by the country's geography, with many rural areas being inaccessible by public transportation. In these areas, people often rely on **boda bodas** (motorcycle taxis) or walking to get around. The government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of public transportation systems.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Good coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Kenya |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Extensive network, variable quality |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$2.00 | $30-$50 | Limited routes, mainly in Nairobi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Widely available, but prices may vary |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.20 | $5-$10 | Uber, Bolt available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, prices vary depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mainly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Prices vary depending on bus company and route |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, prices vary depending on airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mainly between major cities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using matatus or city buses instead of taxis or ride-hailing apps.\n- Use reputable ride-hailing apps like Uber or Bolt to ensure safe and reliable transportation.\n- Always negotiate the price with taxi drivers before starting your journey to avoid overcharging.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for long-distance travel or intercity trips to have more flexibility and comfort.\n- Download transportation apps like **Mondo Ride** or **Little Ride** to book rides and track your journey in real-time.",
