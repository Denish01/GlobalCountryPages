  "content": "In Kenya, the official languages are **Swahili** and **English**, with Swahili being the most widely spoken language among locals.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Swahili, English\nWidely Spoken: Kikuyu, Luhya, Luo, Kalenjin\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Bantu, Nilotic\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Kenya is diverse, with over 40 languages spoken across the country. **Swahili**, also known as Kiswahili, is the national language and is widely spoken by most Kenyans, while **English** is the language of business, education, and government. Regional dialects and minority languages are also prevalent, with languages like Kikuyu, Luhya, and Luo being spoken by various ethnic groups. English is understood by a significant portion of the population, particularly in urban areas and among those in the tourism industry, making it relatively easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the country.\n\nDespite the diversity of languages, Swahili is the language that unites Kenyans, and it is commonly used in informal settings, such as markets and social gatherings. In addition, many Kenyans speak multiple languages, including their local dialect, Swahili, and English. This linguistic versatility has contributed to the country's rich cultural heritage and has facilitated communication among people from different regions and backgrounds.\n\nKenya's language policy aims to promote the use of Swahili and English, while also recognizing the importance of local languages and dialects. As a result, language education is an essential part of the country's curriculum, with students learning both Swahili and English from a young age. This emphasis on language education has contributed to the country's relatively high literacy rates and has enabled Kenyans to communicate effectively with people from other countries.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Jambo | JAHM-boh | informal |\n| Hello | Habari | HAH-bah-ree | formal |\n| Thank you | Asante | AH-sahn-teh |  |\n| Please | Tafadhali | TAH-fah-DAH-lee |  |\n| Yes / No | Ndiyo / Hapana | NDEE-yoh / HAH-pah-nah |  |\n| Excuse me | Samahani | SAH-mah-HAH-nee |  |\n| How much? | Ngapi | NG-ah-pee |  |\n| Where is...? | Wapi...? | WAH-pee... |  |\n| I don't understand | Siielewi | see-eh-LEH-wee |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Unazungumza Kiingereza? | oo-NAH-zoo-N-goo-m-zah kee-NG-eh-reh-zah |  |\n| Help! | Usaidizi | oo-SAH-ee-dee-zee |  |\n| Goodbye | Kwaheri | KWAH-heh-ree |  |\n| Sorry | Pole | POH-leh |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Moja | MOH-jah |\n| 2 | Mbili | MM-bee-lee |\n| 3 | Tatu | TAH-too |\n| 4 | Nne | NN-eh |\n| 5 | Tano | TAH-noh |\n| 6 | Sita | SEE-tah |\n| 7 | Saba | SAH-bah |\n| 8 | Nane | NAH-neh |\n| 9 | Tisa | TEE-sah |\n| 10 | Kumi | KOO-mee |\n| 100 | Mia | MEE-ah |\n| 1000 | Elf | EL-ef |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when interacting with elderly individuals or in formal settings.\n- Use formal language when speaking to someone you don't know well, and avoid using slang or colloquial expressions.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Swahili, such as \"jambo\" (hello) and \"asante\" (thank you), as this will show appreciation for the local culture.\n- Be patient and courteous when communicating, as Kenyans value hospitality and respect for others.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the left hand or touching someone's head.\n- Smile and make eye contact when interacting with locals, as this will help to build trust and rapport.\n- Learn about local norms and customs, such as removing your shoes when entering a mosque or a traditional home.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a language course or attend a language exchange event to learn more about Swahili and Kenyan culture.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites and YouTube channels, to learn more about the language and culture.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or interpreter to help with communication and navigation, particularly in rural areas or when interacting with local communities.",
