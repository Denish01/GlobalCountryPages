[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Kenya is a country with diverse climate zones, ranging from tropical to arid, with the climate varying greatly depending on the region. The country has two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from June to October and from December to February, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with minimal rainfall. This season is ideal for wildlife spotting, as the dry conditions make it easier to spot animals, and the weather is perfect for outdoor activities such as hiking and camping. The wet season, which runs from March to May and from November to December, is marked by heavy rainfall and potential flooding, making it less ideal for travel.

The seasons in Kenya have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's national parks and wildlife reserves. The wet season, on the other hand, can make some areas inaccessible due to flooding and mud, and the rain can make it difficult to spot wildlife. However, the wet season is also a great time to see the country's lush green landscapes and to witness the Great Migration, one of the most spectacular wildlife events in the world.

The climate in Kenya also varies depending on the region, with the coastal areas being generally hotter and more humid than the highlands. The highlands, which include the **Aberdare Mountains** and **Mount Kenya**, have a cooler climate, with temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. The **Lake Victoria** region, on the other hand, has a warm and humid climate, with temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius.
