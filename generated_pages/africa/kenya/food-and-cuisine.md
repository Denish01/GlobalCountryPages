[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Kenyan cuisine is a reflection of the country's cultural diversity, with influences from its African, Arab, and European heritage. The cuisine is characterized by the use of local ingredients such as corn, beans, and vegetables, as well as the incorporation of international spices and flavors. Regional variations in Kenyan cuisine are notable, with different communities having their own unique dishes and cooking styles. For example, the coastal region is known for its seafood dishes, while the western region is famous for its **Luhya** dishes, which feature corn and beans as main ingredients.

The cuisine in Kenya is also shaped by the country's history, with the introduction of new crops and cooking techniques by European colonizers and Arab traders. Today, Kenyan cuisine is a vibrant and eclectic mix of traditional and modern flavors, with popular dishes like **Chapati** (flatbread) and **Mandazi** (fried doughnuts) being enjoyed by people from all walks of life. The cuisine is also influenced by the country's geography, with the fertile highlands and coastal regions providing a wide range of fresh produce and seafood.

Kenyan cuisine is not just about the food, but also about the social and cultural context in which it is consumed. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and the sharing of food is an important aspect of Kenyan hospitality. In many Kenyan communities, food is also an integral part of traditional ceremonies and celebrations, such as weddings and festivals.
