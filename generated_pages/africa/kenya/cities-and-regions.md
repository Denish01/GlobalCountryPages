[SECTION] How Kenya Is Divided [/SECTION]
Kenya is divided into 47 counties, which are the primary administrative divisions of the country. These counties are further divided into sub-counties, wards, and locations. The county system was introduced in 2013, replacing the previous system of provinces and districts. The new system aims to promote decentralization and give more autonomy to local governments. Each county has its own government, led by a governor and a county assembly, which oversees the provision of services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

The 47 counties in Kenya vary greatly in terms of size, population, and economic development. Some counties, such as Nairobi and Mombasa, are urbanized and economically developed, while others, such as Turkana and Marsabit, are rural and less developed. The county system has helped to promote regional development and address the unique needs of each area. However, it also faces challenges such as limited resources, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure.
