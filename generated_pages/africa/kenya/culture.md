# Kenya Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Kenya's culture is a rich and diverse blend of influences from its 42 ethnic groups, with the largest being the Kikuyu, Luhya, and Luo. The country's cultural identity is shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Africa, Asia, and Europe, with a history of trade and migration that dates back centuries. The official languages, Swahili and English, reflect the country's colonial past and its current status as a major player in East African affairs. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Kenya is characterized by a mix of Bantu, Nilotic, and Cushitic groups, each with their own distinct traditions and customs.

Kenya's cultural identity is also defined by its strong sense of community and social cohesion, with many Kenyans placing a high value on family, respect for elders, and traditional practices. The concept of **ubuntu**, or humanity towards others, is a core aspect of Kenyan culture, emphasizing the importance of treating others with kindness, respect, and generosity. The country's cultural heritage is further enriched by its Islamic, Christian, and traditional African influences, which are reflected in its music, art, and literature. From the vibrant **Maasai** beadwork to the intricate **Kikuyu** carvings, Kenya's cultural expressions are a testament to the country's rich cultural diversity.

The cultural landscape of Kenya is also influenced by its urban-rural divide, with cities like Nairobi and Mombasa exhibiting a more modern and cosmopolitan culture, while rural areas tend to retain traditional practices and customs. This blend of modern and traditional elements has given rise to a unique Kenyan culture that is both dynamic and rooted in its heritage. As a visitor to Kenya, it is essential to be aware of and respect these cultural nuances to truly appreciate the country's warm hospitality and rich cultural diversity.
