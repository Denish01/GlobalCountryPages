  "content": "Libya is generally cheaper than Tunisia, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLibya GDP per Capita (PPP): 9,446\nTunisia GDP per Capita (PPP): 11,987\nLibya Inflation Rate: 2.4%\nTunisia Inflation Rate: 5.7%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Libya\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Libya vs Tunisia [/SECTION]\nLibya and Tunisia are two neighboring countries in North Africa, with distinct economic and cultural profiles. Libya has a larger territory and a smaller population, with a GDP per capita that is lower than Tunisia's. However, Libya's cost of living is generally lower, making it a more affordable destination for expats, students, and travelers. The main reason for this is the difference in economic conditions, with Libya's economy still recovering from years of conflict and instability, while Tunisia has a more diversified and stable economy.\n\nThe cost of living in Libya is around 20-30% lower than in Tunisia, with significant differences in housing, food, and transportation costs. For example, a one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Tripoli, Libya's capital, can cost around $200-300 per month, while a similar apartment in Tunis, Tunisia's capital, can cost around $400-600 per month. Similarly, a meal at a mid-range restaurant in Libya can cost around $5-10, while in Tunisia it can cost around $10-20. These differences make Libya a more attractive option for those looking for a affordable lifestyle in North Africa.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Libya (USD) | Tunisia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 450 | 44% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 300 | 50% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 500 | 900 | 44% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Libya (USD) | Tunisia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 8 | 15 | 46% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 5 | 40% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Libya (USD) | Tunisia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.2 | 0.5 | 60% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Libya (USD) | Tunisia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Libya (USD) | Tunisia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,500 | 2,500 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Libya is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 40-50% lower than in Tunisia\n- Transportation, with fuel and taxi prices that are 50-60% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices that are 33-50% lower\n- Groceries and food, with prices that are 33-46% lower\n- **Tunisia is cheaper for:**\n- Travel and tourism, with a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of options\n- Education, with a more established and reputable university system\n- Healthcare, with better-equipped and staffed hospitals and medical facilities\n- Shopping, with a wider range of international brands and products available\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nLibya and Tunisia offer different value propositions for different lifestyles.
