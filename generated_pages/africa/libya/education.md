[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Libya is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, is free and provides a basic education in subjects such as Arabic, mathematics, science, and Islamic studies. Secondary education, which lasts for three years, provides more advanced education in a range of subjects, including **foreign languages**, mathematics, and science. Tertiary education, which includes universities and colleges, provides higher education in a range of fields, including **engineering**, **medicine**, and **law**.

The quality of education in Libya varies, with some schools and universities providing high-quality education, while others struggle with limited resources and outdated curricula. Public education is free and widely available, but private schools and universities are also popular, especially among those who can afford them. The **Ministry of Education** is responsible for overseeing the education system, and has implemented a range of reforms in recent years to improve the quality of education and increase access to education for all.

Despite these efforts, the education system in Libya still faces a number of challenges, including a lack of resources, outdated curricula, and a shortage of qualified teachers. The **civil war** that took place in Libya in 2011 also had a significant impact on the education system, with many schools and universities damaged or destroyed. However, the government and international organizations are working to rebuild and improve the education system, and there are many opportunities for students to pursue higher education and career advancement.
