Libya has a **territorial tax system**, which means that individuals and companies are taxed only on the income earned within the country.

To be considered a tax resident in Libya, an individual must have a permanent home in the country or spend more than 183 days in a calendar year within the country.

The Libyan tax system is governed by the **Income Tax Law** and the **Value-Added Tax Law**, which provide the framework for the taxation of individuals and companies. The tax authorities in Libya are responsible for the administration and collection of taxes, and they have the power to conduct audits and impose penalties for non-compliance. Taxpayers are required to file tax returns and pay taxes on a timely basis to avoid penalties and interest.
