[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Libya's transportation system is still developing, with most people relying on private vehicles or taxis to get around. The country's public transportation network is limited, with city buses and minibuses being the primary modes of public transport. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Tripoli having a more comprehensive network than other cities. In general, the roads in Libya are in good condition, but traffic congestion is a common problem in urban areas.

The lack of a well-developed public transportation system in Libya makes it difficult for people to get around without a private vehicle. However, many cities have a system of shared taxis and minibuses that operate on fixed routes, providing an affordable and convenient way to travel. Additionally, the country's geography, with its vast deserts and limited coastal roads, can make it challenging to travel long distances. Despite these challenges, the Libyan government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, with plans to develop a new rail network and expand the country's airport capacity.
