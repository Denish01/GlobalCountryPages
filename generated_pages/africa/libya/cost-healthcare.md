[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Libya has a mixed healthcare system that combines elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality and is often overcrowded and underfunded, while private healthcare facilities offer higher quality services but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to the high cost of private healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the high costs of private healthcare in Libya.

The healthcare system in Libya is also heavily reliant on foreign-trained medical professionals, and many Libyan doctors and nurses have received training in countries such as the UK, US, and Egypt. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of healthcare infrastructure and resources, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, Libya has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, and many private hospitals and clinics have been established in major cities such as Tripoli and Benghazi.
