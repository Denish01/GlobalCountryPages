[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Libya has several international airports, with Tripoli International Airport and Mitiga International Airport being the main entry points. Direct flights to Libya are available from major hubs in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including Istanbul, Cairo, and Tunis. However, due to the current security situation, many international airlines have suspended their services to Libya, and travelers may need to fly into neighboring countries and then enter Libya overland. The main overland entry points are from Tunisia, Egypt, and Algeria, although crossing the border can be challenging and may require special permits.

The main border crossings are at Ras Jdir (Tunisia), Musaid (Egypt), and Ghadames (Algeria), and travelers should be prepared for long delays and strict security checks. It is essential to check the current security situation and any travel restrictions before planning a trip to Libya. Additionally, travelers should ensure they have all the necessary visas and documents, as well as a valid passport with at least six months' validity.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Libya has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting the main cities, including Tripoli, Benghazi, and Sebha. The main domestic airlines are Libyan Airlines, Afriqiyah Airways, and Buraq Air, which operate flights between the main cities. However, the frequency and reliability of these flights can be unpredictable, and travelers should be prepared for delays and cancellations. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, and it is recommended to use a local travel agent or contact the airlines directly. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Libya does not have a rail network, and there are no train services available in the country. This means that travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around. However, there have been plans to develop a rail network in the future, which could potentially connect the main cities and improve transportation options.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Libya has a network of intercity buses and coaches that connect the main cities, including Tripoli, Benghazi, and Sebha. The main bus companies are the Libyan Public Transport Company and several private operators, which offer services on a variety of routes. However, the quality of the buses and coaches can vary, and travelers should be prepared for crowded and uncomfortable conditions. Costs for bus travel range from $5 to $20, depending on the route and operator.
