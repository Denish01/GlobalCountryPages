# Libya Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Libya's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant gaps in rural areas, and is currently being developed and expanded through various investments and projects. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 97% of population
Internet Penetration: 23%
Road Network: 100,000 km, moderate quality with some paved highways and many unpaved roads
Rail Network: 0 km, no railways
Major Airports: 12
Major Ports: 12, including the major ports of Tripoli, Benghazi, and Misrata
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Libya's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other African countries, with a strong focus on the oil and gas sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. However, the recent years of conflict and instability have taken a toll on the country's infrastructure, with many facilities damaged or destroyed. The government has been investing in recent years to upgrade and expand the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, airports, and seaports. Despite these efforts, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.

The country's infrastructure is also being developed to support the growth of the **tourism sector**, which is seen as a key area for economic diversification. This includes the construction of new hotels, resorts, and other tourist facilities, as well as the development of **cultural heritage sites** and other tourist attractions. However, the development of the tourism sector is still in its early stages, and much work needs to be done to develop the necessary infrastructure and services to support the growth of this sector.

Overall, Libya's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant gaps in rural areas. The government is working to address these gaps through investments in new infrastructure projects, but much work remains to be done to develop a comprehensive and integrated infrastructure system that meets the needs of the country's growing population.
