  "content": "Libya is generally more expensive than Sudan, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLibya GDP per Capita (PPP): 12,944\nSudan GDP per Capita (PPP): 4,482\nLibya Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nSudan Inflation Rate: 50.4%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Sudan\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Libya vs Sudan [/SECTION]\nLibya and Sudan are two neighboring countries in North Africa with distinct economic profiles. Libya has a relatively high GDP per capita, driven by its oil exports, while Sudan's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on agriculture and manufacturing. The cost of living in Libya is generally higher than in Sudan, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more expensive. However, Sudan's high inflation rate can erode the purchasing power of its citizens, making it essential to consider the overall economic context when comparing the two countries.\n\nThe cost of living difference between Libya and Sudan can be attributed to various factors, including the countries' economic structures, government policies, and geographic locations. Libya's oil-driven economy has led to a higher standard of living, but it also makes the country more vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. In contrast, Sudan's diversified economy has helped the country to maintain a more stable economic environment, despite facing challenges such as high inflation and a large trade deficit. Overall, Sudan is generally cheaper than Libya, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Libya (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 250 | 38% cheaper in Sudan |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 150 | 40% cheaper in Sudan |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 700 | 450 | 36% cheaper in Sudan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Libya (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper in Sudan |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 200 | 33% cheaper in Sudan |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 40% cheaper in Sudan |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1 | 50% cheaper in Sudan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Libya (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper in Sudan |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 0.5 | 50% cheaper in Sudan |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.5 | 0.3 | 40% cheaper in Sudan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Libya (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 60 | 40% cheaper in Sudan |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 20 | 33% cheaper in Sudan |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper in Sudan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Libya (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 500 | 37.5% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 800 | 33.3% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,200 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Libya is cheaper for:**\n- High-end electronics and luxury goods, which are often imported from Europe and the Middle East\n- International flights, with more frequent connections to major hubs\n- Private education, with a range of international schools and universities\n- Medical care, with better-equipped hospitals and more specialized doctors\n- **Sudan is cheaper for:**\n- Basic groceries and household items, which are often produced locally\n- Public transportation, with a well-developed network of buses and taxis\n- Accommodation, with a wider range of affordable options\n- Traditional clothing and handicrafts, which are often made locally\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Sudan may offer better value due to its lower cost of living and more affordable accommodation options. However, Libya's higher standard of living and better infrastructure may make it more attractive to those who prioritize comfort and convenience. For families, Sudan's lower cost of living and more traditional lifestyle may be more appealing, while Libya's better education and healthcare systems may be more important for those with young children. Ultimately, the choice between Libya and Sudan depends on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences.\n\nIn terms of specific costs, Sudan is generally cheaper for basic expenses such as food, transportation, and accommodation, while Libya is more expensive but offers better quality and a wider range of options. For those on a tight budget, Sudan may be the more affordable choice, while those with a higher income may prefer Libya's more comfortable lifestyle.
