Eating out is a common practice in Libya, particularly in urban areas, with many restaurants and cafes serving traditional dishes such as **couscous**, **shawarma**, and **falafel**. However, home cooking is also an essential part of Libyan culture, with many families preparing meals using fresh ingredients and traditional recipes.
