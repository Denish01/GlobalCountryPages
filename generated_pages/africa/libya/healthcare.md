[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Libya's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers across the country. However, the quality of care in public facilities can be inconsistent, and patients often face long waiting times and shortages of medical supplies. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. In urban areas like Tripoli, access to healthcare is generally better, with more facilities and specialized services available. In contrast, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare, with fewer facilities and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals.

The quality of care in Libya is also affected by the country's **political instability** and **economic challenges**, which have led to a brain drain of skilled healthcare professionals and a shortage of medical supplies. As a result, patients often have to travel to other countries, such as Tunisia or Egypt, for specialized medical care. Despite these challenges, the Libyan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new facilities and equipment, and increasing the number of healthcare professionals.

Overall, while Libya's healthcare system has the potential to provide good-quality care, it is often hindered by **infrastructure challenges** and **resource constraints**. Patients who can afford it often opt for private healthcare, which can provide better-quality care, but at a higher cost. Expats and foreigners living in Libya are advised to have private health insurance to ensure access to quality medical care.
