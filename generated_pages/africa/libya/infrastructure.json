  "content": "Libya's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant gaps in rural areas, and is currently being developed and expanded through various investments and projects. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 97% of population\nInternet Penetration: 23%\nRoad Network: 100,000 km, moderate quality with some paved highways and many unpaved roads\nRail Network: 0 km, no railways\nMajor Airports: 12\nMajor Ports: 12, including the major ports of Tripoli, Benghazi, and Misrata\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nLibya's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other African countries, with a strong focus on the oil and gas sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. However, the recent years of conflict and instability have taken a toll on the country's infrastructure, with many facilities damaged or destroyed. The government has been investing in recent years to upgrade and expand the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, airports, and seaports. Despite these efforts, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.\n\nThe country's infrastructure is also being developed to support the growth of the **tourism sector**, which is seen as a key area for economic diversification. This includes the construction of new hotels, resorts, and other tourist facilities, as well as the development of **cultural heritage sites** and other tourist attractions. However, the development of the tourism sector is still in its early stages, and much work needs to be done to develop the necessary infrastructure and services to support the growth of this sector.\n\nOverall, Libya's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant gaps in rural areas. The government is working to address these gaps through investments in new infrastructure projects, but much work remains to be done to develop a comprehensive and integrated infrastructure system that meets the needs of the country's growing population.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 100,000 km | Moderate | Many roads are unpaved, especially in rural areas |\n| Railways | 0 km | N/A | No railways in Libya |\n| Airports | 12 international, 10 domestic | Good | Many airports are modern and well-equipped |\n| Ports | 12 major | Good | Many ports are well-equipped and handle significant volumes of cargo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Libya's **power generation** is primarily based on **natural gas** and **oil**, with some **renewable energy** sources such as solar and wind power\n- The country's **electricity grid** is relatively developed, with a high level of access to electricity, especially in urban areas\n- However, the **reliability of the grid** is a concern, with frequent **power outages** and **blackouts** reported, especially during periods of high demand\n- The government is investing in **renewable energy** projects, including **solar farms** and **wind farms**, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and improve the reliability of the grid\n- **Energy efficiency** is also a key area of focus, with efforts to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of energy-efficient appliances and technologies\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally not safe to drink, especially in rural areas, and many people rely on **bottled water** or **water purification systems**\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, especially in urban areas, but there are still significant gaps in rural areas\n- **Water access** is a significant challenge in rural areas, where many people rely on **traditional wells** or **water trucks**\n- The government is investing in **water infrastructure** projects, including the construction of new **water treatment plants** and **wastewater treatment facilities**\n- **Water conservation** is also a key area of focus, with efforts to reduce water waste and promote the use of water-efficient technologies and practices\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread, with many **mobile network operators** providing services across the country\n- **Fiber-optic** and **broadband** services are available in many urban areas, but are less common in rural areas\n- The **4G/5G rollout** is ongoing, with many operators investing in new **network infrastructure** to support the growth of **mobile data** services\n- **Postal services** are available, but are not as widely used as in the past, especially with the growth of **digital communication** services\n- **Internet penetration** is relatively low, especially in rural areas, where **access to internet** services is often limited\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government is investing in a number of **major infrastructure projects**, including the construction of new **roads**, **airports**, and **seaports**\n- The **Great Man-Made River** project is a major **water infrastructure** project that aims to bring **fresh water** from **underground aquifers** in the south to the **coastal regions** in the north\n- The **Libya-Tunisia** **highway** project is a major **transport infrastructure** project that aims to improve **road connectivity** between Libya and Tunisia\n- The government is also investing in **renewable energy** projects, including **solar farms** and **wind farms**, to reduce the country's dependence on **fossil fuels** and improve the **reliability of the grid**\n- The **European Union** and other **international organizations** are providing **funding and technical assistance** to support the development of Libya's infrastructure, including the **energy**, **transport**, and **water** sectors",
