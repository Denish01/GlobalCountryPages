[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Libya's political system is based on a provisional government, established after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi's regime in 2011. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is intended to provide checks and balances, but the system has been weakened by years of conflict and instability. Libya is a **unitary** state, with a centralized government in Tripoli, but there are ongoing debates about the need for greater **decentralization** and regional autonomy.

The Libyan government has struggled to establish a stable and effective system, with multiple factions and militias vying for power. The **Presidential Council**, established in 2016, is intended to serve as a transitional authority, but its powers and legitimacy have been disputed. The **House of Representatives**, elected in 2014, has been unable to function effectively, and a new **constitution** is being drafted to establish a more stable and democratic system.

The Libyan political system is also influenced by **tribal** and **regional** identities, which have played a significant role in the country's conflict and instability. The government has struggled to balance the competing interests and demands of different groups, and to establish a more **inclusive** and **representative** system.
