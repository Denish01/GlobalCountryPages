[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Libya has an upper-middle-income economy, driven primarily by its large oil and natural gas reserves. The country's economy is classified as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. Despite its significant natural resources, Libya's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a decline in oil production, corruption, and a lack of economic diversification. The country's economy is also heavily dependent on imports, with a large trade deficit.

Libya's economic development has been hindered by a lack of investment in non-oil sectors, as well as a shortage of skilled labor. The country's economy has also been affected by the ongoing conflict and political instability, which has led to a decline in foreign investment and a shortage of basic goods and services. However, the country has significant potential for growth and development, particularly in the areas of agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism.

The Libyan government has implemented several economic reforms in recent years, aimed at promoting economic diversification and reducing the country's dependence on oil exports. These reforms include the establishment of a new investment law, which provides incentives for foreign investors, as well as the creation of a number of free trade zones. However, the implementation of these reforms has been slow, and the country's economy continues to face significant challenges.
