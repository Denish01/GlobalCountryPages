Secondary education, which lasts for three years, provides more advanced education in a range of subjects, including **foreign languages**, mathematics, and science. Tertiary education, which includes universities and colleges, provides higher education in a range of fields, including **engineering**, **medicine**, and **law**.\n\nThe quality of education in Libya varies, with some schools and universities providing high-quality education, while others struggle with limited resources and outdated curricula. Public education is free and widely available, but private schools and universities are also popular, especially among those who can afford them. The **Ministry of Education** is responsible for overseeing the education system, and has implemented a range of reforms in recent years to improve the quality of education and increase access to education for all.\n\nDespite these efforts, the education system in Libya still faces a number of challenges, including a lack of resources, outdated curricula, and a shortage of qualified teachers.
