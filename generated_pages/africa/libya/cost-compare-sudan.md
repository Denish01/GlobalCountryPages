[SECTION] Overview: Libya vs Sudan [/SECTION]
Libya and Sudan are two neighboring countries in North Africa with distinct economic profiles. Libya has a relatively high GDP per capita, driven by its oil exports, while Sudan's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on agriculture and manufacturing. The cost of living in Libya is generally higher than in Sudan, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more expensive. However, Sudan's high inflation rate can erode the purchasing power of its citizens, making it essential to consider the overall economic context when comparing the two countries.

The cost of living difference between Libya and Sudan can be attributed to various factors, including the countries' economic structures, government policies, and geographic locations. Libya's oil-driven economy has led to a higher standard of living, but it also makes the country more vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. In contrast, Sudan's diversified economy has helped the country to maintain a more stable economic environment, despite facing challenges such as high inflation and a large trade deficit. Overall, Sudan is generally cheaper than Libya, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.
