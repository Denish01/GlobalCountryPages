[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Libya's education system is overseen by the Ministry of Education, with a focus on providing free and compulsory education to all citizens from primary to secondary level. The language of instruction is primarily Arabic, although some private and international schools may offer instruction in other languages such as English or French. The quality of public education in Libya can vary, with some schools facing challenges related to infrastructure, resources, and teacher training, while private schools tend to offer higher quality education with better facilities and more qualified teachers. Compulsory education in Libya lasts for 9 years, from age 6 to 15, and is divided into primary and secondary levels.

International schools are available in major cities such as Tripoli and Benghazi, offering a range of curricula including British, American, and French systems. These schools cater to the children of expatriates and wealthy Libyans, providing a high-quality education with qualified teachers and modern facilities. However, the cost of attending an international school in Libya can be prohibitively expensive for many families, with annual fees ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 or more.
