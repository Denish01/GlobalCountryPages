  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Libya can vary significantly depending on whether you use public or private healthcare services, with the average health expenditure per capita being around $470 per year. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $470\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 19.2%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 190\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: LYD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nLibya has a mixed healthcare system that combines elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality and is often overcrowded and underfunded, while private healthcare facilities offer higher quality services but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to the high cost of private healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the high costs of private healthcare in Libya.\n\nThe healthcare system in Libya is also heavily reliant on foreign-trained medical professionals, and many Libyan doctors and nurses have received training in countries such as the UK, US, and Egypt. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of healthcare infrastructure and resources, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, Libya has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, and many private hospitals and clinics have been established in major cities such as Tripoli and Benghazi.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals often have long waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private clinics often have more experienced specialists |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics offer more advanced services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private optometry clinics offer more comprehensive eye exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private labs often have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals often have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Private hospitals often have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$2,000 | Private hospitals offer more comprehensive maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private radiology clinics often have more advanced equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Public hospitals often have limited radiology services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital visits, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private hospital visits, specialist consultations, advanced medical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | International hospital visits, emergency medical evacuations, comprehensive medical coverage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Many common medications are available over-the-counter at pharmacies in Libya, with prices ranging from $5-$20 per prescription.\n- Prescription medications often require a doctor's note and can cost $10-$50 per prescription.\n- Private pharmacies often have a wider selection of medications and may offer more competitive pricing.\n- Some medications may be unavailable or difficult to find in Libya, particularly in rural areas.\n- It is recommended that foreigners and expats bring any necessary medications with them when traveling to Libya.\n- Pharmacies are generally widely available in major cities, but may be limited in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended that foreigners and expats seek treatment at a private hospital or clinic, as these facilities often have more advanced equipment and more experienced medical staff.
