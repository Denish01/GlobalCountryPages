[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Libya's population size is relatively small compared to other African countries, but its growth rate is moderate, driven by a relatively high fertility rate and improvements in healthcare. The country has experienced significant urbanization, with the majority of the population residing in cities, particularly along the coastal regions. Migration patterns have been influenced by the country's history of conflict and economic instability, with many Libyans seeking opportunities abroad. However, the country has also attracted migrant workers from other African and Asian countries, contributing to its cultural diversity.

The population growth rate has been affected by various factors, including the country's economic conditions, access to education and healthcare, and migration trends. Despite the challenges, Libya has made progress in reducing its mortality rates and increasing life expectancy, reflecting improvements in its healthcare system. The urban population is expected to continue growing, driven by the country's economic development and the attraction of urban centers.

Libya's population is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 25.6 years, which presents both opportunities and challenges for the country's development. The young population can contribute to the country's economic growth and innovation, but it also poses challenges in terms of education, employment, and healthcare.
