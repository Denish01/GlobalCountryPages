[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Liberia is still in its developing stages, with a significant urban-rural divide in terms of connectivity and speed. While major cities like Monrovia have relatively better internet access, rural areas often struggle with limited or no connectivity. The average internet speed in Liberia is around 2.5 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries. However, the country is making efforts to improve its internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber optic cables and mobile network upgrades. Despite these efforts, the internet in Liberia can be unreliable, with frequent outages and slow speeds, especially during peak hours.

The reliability of the internet in Liberia is also a concern, with frequent power outages and network congestion affecting connectivity. However, the situation is improving, with more internet service providers entering the market and increasing competition. This has led to better services and more affordable prices, making it easier for people to access the internet. Additionally, the Liberian government has launched initiatives to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the development of a national broadband strategy and the establishment of a telecoms regulator.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Liberia is relatively easy, with several mobile network operators offering prepaid and postpaid plans. The main carriers in Liberia are Lonestar Cell, Orange Liberia, and MTN Liberia, all of which offer tourist-friendly plans. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and fill out a registration form. You can buy SIM cards at the airport, mobile network operator shops, or at street vendors. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, and data plans start from around 5 USD per month for 1 GB of data.

The recommended carriers for tourists are Lonestar Cell and Orange Liberia, both of which offer affordable data plans and good coverage in major cities. MTN Liberia is also a popular option, but its coverage is limited in some areas. It's worth noting that SIM cards can be bought without a registration process, but this may limit your ability to access certain services or make international calls.
