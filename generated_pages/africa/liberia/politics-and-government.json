The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people and serves a six-year term. The **legislative branch** is composed of a bicameral legislature, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate has 30 members, with two members elected from each of the 15 counties, while the House of Representatives has 73 members, with each member representing a district. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court, which has the final say on matters of law and the constitution.\n\nThe system of government in Liberia is designed to provide a balance of power among the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the others. The President has the power to appoint judges, ambassadors, and other high-ranking officials, but these appointments must be confirmed by the Senate. The Legislature has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto them. The Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution and laws, and to declare them void if they are found to be unconstitutional.\n\nLiberia's political system is based on the principles of **democracy**, **equality**, and **justice**. The country has a multiparty system, with several parties competing for power. The government is committed to protecting the rights of all citizens, regardless of their background, ethnicity, or political affiliation.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President George Weah | Head of state and head of government |\n| Legislative | Liberian Legislature | Speaker Bhofal Chambers | Lawmaking body |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice Francis Korkpor | Interpreter of the constitution and laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Coalition for Democratic Change | Center-right | President George Weah | 21 | Ruling party |\n| Unity Party | Center-left | Joseph Boakai | 20 | Main opposition party |\n| Liberty Party | Center | Charles Brumskine | 3 | Third-largest party |\n| All Liberian Party | Center-right | Benoni Urey | 2 | Minor party |\n| Alternative National Congress | Center-left | Alexander Cummings | 1 | Minor party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- Liberia has a **presidential system**, with the President elected by **popular vote** for a six-year term.\n- The **last presidential election** was held in 2017, with President George Weah winning the runoff election.\n- The **next presidential election** is scheduled to be held in 2023.\n- **Voter participation** is relatively high, with over 75% of registered voters participating in the 2017 presidential election.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Liberia has made significant progress in **consolidating democracy** since the end of the civil war in 2003.\n- The country still faces **challenges** such as **corruption**, **poverty**, and **unemployment**, which can undermine **political stability**.\n- The government has implemented several **reforms** to improve the business climate and attract foreign investment.\n- Liberia has a **fragile security situation**, with the security sector still recovering from the devastating effects of the civil war.\n- The country is also **vulnerable to regional instability**, particularly from neighboring countries such as Guinea and Ivory Coast.\n- Liberia has a **mixed record** on **human rights**, with concerns about freedom of speech, assembly, and the press.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Liberia is a **member of the United Nations** and participates in several **international organizations**, including the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States.\n- The country has **diplomatic relations** with over 100 countries, including the United States, China, and the European Union.\n- Liberia has a **strategic partnership** with the United States, which provides significant **development assistance** to the country.\n- The country is also a **member of the International Monetary Fund** and the **World Bank**, and has received significant **financial assistance** from these institutions.\n- Liberia has a **regional security agreement** with neighboring countries, including Guinea and Sierra Leone, to cooperate on **border security** and **counter-terrorism**.",
