In contrast, the rural areas have limited access to basic amenities and infrastructure, making them less attractive to investors. The price trajectory is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the growing demand and limited supply of properties.

The government has also introduced tax incentives and other benefits to encourage foreign investment in the property sector. However, the market still faces challenges, including the lack of infrastructure, limited access to financing, and bureaucratic hurdles. Despite these challenges, the Liberian property market offers opportunities for investors, particularly in the urban areas.
