  "content": "The population of Liberia is approximately 5.4 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, and a growing urban population.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 5.4 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.7%\nMedian Age: 18.5 years\nUrban Population: 52%\nPopulation Density: 47 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 62 years\nFertility Rate: 4.3 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nLiberia's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in West Africa, but it has been growing rapidly in recent years, with an average annual growth rate of 2.7%. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and improvements in healthcare and sanitation. The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 52% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Monrovia. Migration patterns in Liberia are largely driven by economic factors, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of work and better living conditions.\n\nThe population of Liberia is also characterized by a high percentage of young people, with approximately 43% of the population under the age of 15. This demographic trend has significant implications for the country's development, as it will require significant investments in education, healthcare, and other social services to support the growing population. Despite these challenges, Liberia has made significant progress in recent years in reducing poverty and improving living standards, and the country is poised for continued growth and development in the coming years.\n\nLiberia's population growth has also been influenced by its history of conflict and displacement, with many people forced to flee their homes during the country's civil wars. However, with the restoration of peace and stability, many of these displaced people have begun to return to their homes, and the country is now focused on rebuilding and recovering from the effects of the conflict.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kpelle | 20% | Central and Western Liberia | Largest ethnic group in Liberia |\n| Bassa | 13% | Central and Eastern Liberia | Known for their expertise in fishing and farming |\n| Grebo | 10% | Southeastern Liberia | Have a strong tradition of mask-making and other crafts |\n| Gio | 8% | Northern Liberia | Known for their expertise in hunting and gathering |\n| Mano | 7% | Northern Liberia | Have a strong tradition of farming and herding |\n| Krahn | 5% | Eastern Liberia | Known for their expertise in hunting and gathering |\n| Vai | 5% | Northwestern Liberia | Have a strong tradition of farming and trading |\n| Mandingo | 3% | Northern Liberia | Known for their expertise in trade and commerce |\n[/TABLE]\nLiberia is home to a diverse range of ethnic groups, with over 20 different groups represented in the country.
