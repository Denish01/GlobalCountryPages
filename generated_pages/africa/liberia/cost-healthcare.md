[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Liberia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and infrastructure, while private healthcare providers offer better quality care but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it may prefer to use private healthcare services. The healthcare system is also heavily reliant on out-of-pocket payments, with 63.2% of healthcare expenditure being paid directly by individuals. This can be a significant burden for many Liberians, and insurance is highly recommended to help cover unexpected medical expenses.

The Liberian government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing the budget for healthcare and implementing programs to improve access to healthcare services. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system, including a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services in rural areas. For foreigners, it is often recommended to have international health insurance that covers medical evacuation, as the quality of care in Liberia may not be up to international standards.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. However, ambulance services may be limited, and it may be necessary to arrange for private transportation to the hospital. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuation, as the quality of care in Liberia may not be up to international standards. The best hospitals for foreigners in Liberia include the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia, which offers a range of medical services and has a reputation for providing high-quality care. However, even at the best hospitals, the quality of care may not be up to international standards, and medical evacuation may still be necessary in serious cases.

It is also recommended to take precautions to prevent illnesses and injuries, such as taking malaria prophylaxis, using insect repellent, and avoiding untreated water. Additionally, it is a good idea to research local healthcare options and have a plan in place for emergency medical situations before traveling to Liberia. By being prepared and taking necessary precautions, travelers can minimize their risk of illness or injury and have a safe and healthy trip to Liberia.
