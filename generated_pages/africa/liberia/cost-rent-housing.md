[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Liberia's housing market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional accommodations, with a growing demand for housing driven by the country's economic growth and urbanization. The rental market in Liberia is relatively unregulated, with most landlords requiring a one-year lease and a security deposit equivalent to one or two months' rent. Tenants have limited rights, and disputes are often resolved through negotiation or mediation. Compared to its regional neighbors, Liberia's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the capital city of Monrovia. However, the cost of living in Liberia is still relatively low, making it an attractive destination for expats and investors.

The housing market in Liberia is also influenced by the country's history of conflict and instability, which has led to a shortage of quality housing stock. As a result, many Liberians rely on informal housing arrangements, such as shared accommodations or makeshift shelters. However, the government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the development of new housing estates and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Liberia remains challenging, particularly for low-income households and those in rural areas.
