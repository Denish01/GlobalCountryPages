[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Liberia has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by dry and comfortable weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C. This is the best time to visit Liberia, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, surfing, and exploring the country's national parks. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and potential flooding, making it difficult to travel and engage in outdoor activities.

The country's climate is also influenced by its geographic location, with the coastal regions experiencing a more moderate climate than the inland areas. The coastal regions, including the capital city Monrovia, tend to be cooler and more humid than the inland areas, which can be hotter and drier. The climate also varies by elevation, with the higher elevations experiencing a cooler climate than the lower elevations.

Liberia's climate and seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's national parks, beaches, and other outdoor attractions. The wet season, on the other hand, can make it difficult to travel and engage in outdoor activities, but it is also a good time to visit the country's museums, historical sites, and other indoor attractions.
