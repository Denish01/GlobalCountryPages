[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Liberia's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. The quality of education in public schools is generally lower compared to private schools, due to a lack of resources and qualified teachers. English is the primary language of instruction, and students are required to attend school for at least 6 years. The academic year typically runs from September to June, with a 3-month break in between. International schools are also available in Liberia, primarily in the capital city of Monrovia, offering a range of curricula including American, British, and French.

The education system in Liberia faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education sector, including the introduction of free and compulsory primary education. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Liberians. International schools in Liberia offer a range of curricula and are popular among expatriates and Liberian families who can afford them.
