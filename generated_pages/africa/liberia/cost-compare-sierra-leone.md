[SECTION] Overview: Liberia vs Sierra Leone [/SECTION]
Liberia and Sierra Leone are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Liberia has a relatively lower cost of living, driven by its lower GDP per capita and higher inflation rate. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Sierra Leone has a higher GDP per capita, driven by its robust mining sector, which has led to higher prices for goods and services. Overall, Liberia is around 15-20% cheaper than Sierra Leone, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Liberia's economy is still recovering from the devastating effects of the civil war, which has led to a slower pace of economic growth. In contrast, Sierra Leone's economy has been growing steadily, driven by its mining sector, which has attracted significant foreign investment. As a result, Sierra Leone has a more developed infrastructure, which has driven up prices for goods and services. However, Liberia's lower cost of living makes it an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable lifestyle.
