  "content": "To get around in Liberia, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and rental cars, as the country has a limited rail network and no metro or subway system. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Roberts International Airport (ROB)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nLiberia is accessible by air through the Roberts International Airport (ROB), which is located about 35 miles east of the capital city, Monrovia. The airport receives flights from major airlines such as Brussels Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, and Kenya Airways, with direct connections to European and African cities. If you're traveling from neighboring countries, you can also enter Liberia by land through the border crossings with Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone. The main overland entry points are at Bo Waterside, which connects to Sierra Leone, and the town of Loguatuo, which connects to Ivory Coast.\n\nFor travelers from North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, it's often necessary to connect through a major African hub like Accra, Ghana, or Nairobi, Kenya. In some cases, you may need to obtain a visa before arrival, so it's essential to check with the Liberian embassy or consulate in your home country for the latest requirements. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay in Liberia. \n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nLiberia has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airlines are Liberia National Airlines and Spriggs Payne Airport, which offer flights between Monrovia and other major cities like Buchanan, Harper, and Voinjama. However, these flights are often irregular and may be suspended during the rainy season due to weather conditions. To book domestic flights, you can contact the airlines directly or work with a local travel agent. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 per person, depending on the route and airline.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nLiberia has no rail network, making it impossible to travel by train within the country. The lack of a rail system is due to the country's history of conflict and underdevelopment, which has hindered the construction of modern infrastructure. As a result, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus companies like Guinea-Bissau Transport and SGT operate in Liberia, offering connections between major cities like Monrovia, Buchanan, and Harper. However, the quality of these buses can vary, and the roads are often in poor condition, making for a bumpy ride. Costs for intercity bus travel range from $10 to $30 per person, depending on the route and bus company. It's essential to be prepared for delays and cancellations, especially during the rainy season.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | - | - | Not available |\n| City Bus | Monrovia | $0.50-$1.00 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $5-$10/km | Negotiate the fare beforehand |\n| Ride-Hailing | Monrovia | $5-$10 | Local alternatives like Keke |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | - | - | Not commonly used |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Liberia, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, which can be used for up to three months.\n- Road conditions in Liberia are generally poor, with many roads being unpaved and prone to flooding during the rainy season.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, with gasoline prices averaging around $1.50 per liter.\n- Car rental companies like Avis and Hertz are available in Monrovia, but the selection of vehicles is limited, and prices are relatively high.\n- When driving in Liberia, be aware of the risk of carjacking and robbery, especially at night or in isolated areas.\n- It's essential to have a 4x4 vehicle if you plan to travel outside of Monrovia, as many roads are not suitable for standard vehicles.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be cautious when using taxis, as some drivers may try to overcharge or take you on a longer route than necessary.\n- Always negotiate the fare beforehand, and make sure you have a clear understanding of the price and route.\n- When using local buses, be prepared for overcrowding and delays, and keep a close eye on your belongings.\n- Download local apps like Keke or Liberia Ride to book ride-hailing services or taxis.\n- Avoid traveling at night, especially outside of Monrovia, as the roads can be hazardous and the risk of robbery is higher.\n- Keep your valuables secure and be mindful of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas or markets.\n- Learn some basic phrases in local languages like Liberian English or indigenous languages to help you communicate with locals and get around more easily.\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, especially when interacting with villagers or visiting rural areas.",
