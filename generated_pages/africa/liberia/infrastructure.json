  "content": "The infrastructure in Liberia is still developing, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 38% of population\nInternet Penetration: 7.5%\nRoad Network: 10,600 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nLiberia's infrastructure is still recovering from the devastating effects of the civil war that ended in 2003, which left the country with a significant gap in its development level. Recent investments have focused on rebuilding and expanding key infrastructure such as roads, ports, and energy generation. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with Monrovia and other urban centers having better access to basic services compared to rural areas. The government has made efforts to address this gap, but much work remains to be done to provide equitable access to infrastructure services across the country.\n\nThe Liberian government has implemented several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the creation of a national infrastructure plan and the establishment of a dedicated infrastructure development agency. These efforts have helped to attract foreign investment and funding from international organizations, which has enabled the implementation of several major infrastructure projects. Despite these efforts, Liberia still faces significant challenges in providing reliable and efficient infrastructure services to its population.\n\nLiberia's infrastructure development is also hindered by its limited financial resources, which makes it difficult to maintain and upgrade existing infrastructure. The country is heavily reliant on foreign aid and funding from international organizations, which can be unpredictable and subject to change. To address this challenge, the government has been exploring alternative funding options, such as public-private partnerships and concession agreements, to attract private sector investment in infrastructure development.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 10,600 km | Poor | mostly unpaved, prone to flooding during rainy season |\n| Railways | none | - | no rail network in Liberia |\n| Airports | 2 international, 5 domestic | Moderate | limited capacity and facilities |\n| Ports | 1 major | Good | Freeport of Monrovia, handles most of Liberia's international trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Liberia relies heavily on **thermal power plants** for electricity generation, with a total installed capacity of around 130 MW.\n- The country also has significant **hydroelectric potential**, with several projects under development, including the 77 MW Gbedin Falls hydroelectric project.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are still in the early stages of development, but have significant potential for growth.\n- **Power outages** are frequent, particularly in rural areas, due to the lack of reliable transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **energy access**, including the creation of a national energy policy and the establishment of a rural energy fund to support off-grid energy projects.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in Liberia, with many urban areas lacking access to safe and reliable drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, with around 40% of the population lacking access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is particularly challenging, with many communities relying on traditional water sources such as wells and springs.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water and sanitation services**, including the creation of a national water and sanitation policy and the establishment of a water and sanitation fund to support project implementation.\n- **International organizations** such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank are also providing support to improve water and sanitation services in Liberia.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively good in Liberia, with around 70% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber optic connectivity** is limited, but is being expanded through several projects, including the deployment of a national fiber optic backbone.\n- **4G/5G rollout** is still in the early stages, but several mobile operators have launched 4G services in major urban areas.\n- **Internet penetration** is relatively low, but is growing rapidly, driven by the increasing availability of mobile internet services.\n- **Postal services** are limited, but the government has launched initiatives to improve the postal network and expand services to rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Liberia Energy Access Project** aims to improve energy access in rural areas through the deployment of off-grid energy systems and the expansion of the national grid.\n- The **Monrovia Water Supply Project** aims to improve water supply services in the capital city, including the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and the expansion of the water distribution network.\n- The **Liberia Transport Infrastructure Project** aims to improve road connectivity and transport services, including the rehabilitation of key roads and the construction of new bridges.\n- The **Liberia Telecommunications Project** aims to improve telecommunications services, including the deployment of fiber optic connectivity and the expansion of mobile phone services.\n- The **Liberia Water and Sanitation Project** aims to improve water and sanitation services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the expansion of sanitation facilities.",
