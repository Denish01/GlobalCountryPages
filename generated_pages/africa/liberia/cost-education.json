  "content": "The cost of education in Liberia varies widely depending on the type of institution, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools and international institutions charge tuition fees ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 2.3%\nLiteracy Rate: 48%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: LRD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nLiberia's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. The quality of education in public schools is generally lower compared to private schools, due to a lack of resources and qualified teachers. English is the primary language of instruction, and students are required to attend school for at least 6 years. The academic year typically runs from September to June, with a 3-month break in between. International schools are also available in Liberia, primarily in the capital city of Monrovia, offering a range of curricula including American, British, and French.\n\nThe education system in Liberia faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education sector, including the introduction of free and compulsory primary education. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Liberians. International schools in Liberia offer a range of curricula and are popular among expatriates and Liberian families who can afford them.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 - $20 | Free or subsidized, variable quality |\n| Private Primary | $200 - $500 | Range by tier, better quality than public |\n| Public Secondary | $20 - $50 | Free or subsidized, variable quality |\n| Private Secondary | $500 - $1,000 | Range by tier, better quality than public |\n| International School | $2,000 - $5,000 | American, British, or French curriculum |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100 - $300 | $500 - $1,000 | University of Liberia |\n| Private University | $500 - $1,000 | $1,000 - $2,000 | Range by institution |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000 - $2,000 | $2,000 - $3,000 | United Methodist University |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50 - $100 | Private institutions |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10 - $20 | Subject-specific |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50 - $100 | English or other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20 - $50 | Basic materials |\n| School Uniform | $20 - $50 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Liberia are international schools, which offer a range of curricula and are known for their high quality of education.\n- Scholarships are available for Liberian students, particularly for those pursuing higher education, but opportunities are limited.\n- Online learning options are limited in Liberia, but some institutions offer distance learning programs.\n- Education quality in Liberia is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, due to a lack of resources and qualified teachers.\n- The language of instruction in Liberia is English, but many students also speak local languages.\n- Expats and international students should research schools thoroughly before making a decision, considering factors such as curriculum, quality of education, and extracurricular activities.",
