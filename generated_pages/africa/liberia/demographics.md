[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Liberia's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in West Africa, but it has been growing rapidly in recent years, with an average annual growth rate of 2.7%. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and improvements in healthcare and sanitation. The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 52% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Monrovia. Migration patterns in Liberia are largely driven by economic factors, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of work and better living conditions.

The population of Liberia is also characterized by a high percentage of young people, with approximately 43% of the population under the age of 15. This demographic trend has significant implications for the country's development, as it will require significant investments in education, healthcare, and other social services to support the growing population. Despite these challenges, Liberia has made significant progress in recent years in reducing poverty and improving living standards, and the country is poised for continued growth and development in the coming years.

Liberia's population growth has also been influenced by its history of conflict and displacement, with many people forced to flee their homes during the country's civil wars. However, with the restoration of peace and stability, many of these displaced people have begun to return to their homes, and the country is now focused on rebuilding and recovering from the effects of the conflict.
