[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Liberia is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people and serves a six-year term. The **legislative branch** is composed of a bicameral legislature, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate has 30 members, with two members elected from each of the 15 counties, while the House of Representatives has 73 members, with each member representing a district. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court, which has the final say on matters of law and the constitution.

The system of government in Liberia is designed to provide a balance of power among the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the others. The President has the power to appoint judges, ambassadors, and other high-ranking officials, but these appointments must be confirmed by the Senate. The Legislature has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto them. The Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution and laws, and to declare them void if they are found to be unconstitutional.

Liberia's political system is based on the principles of **democracy**, **equality**, and **justice**. The country has a multiparty system, with several parties competing for power. The government is committed to protecting the rights of all citizens, regardless of their background, ethnicity, or political affiliation.
