Liberian cuisine is also characterized by its use of bold flavors and spices, with peppers, onions, and garlic being staples in many dishes. Regional variations are also evident, with the coastal regions favoring seafood and the interior regions relying on meat and vegetables.\n\nThe country's history as a former American colony has also had a significant impact on its cuisine, with many traditional American dishes like fried chicken and mashed potatoes being adapted and incorporated into Liberian cuisine.
