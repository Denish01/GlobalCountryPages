        <h2>How Liberia Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Liberia is divided into 15 counties, each with its own administrative structure and local government. These counties are further subdivided into districts, which are the second-level administrative divisions. The counties are: Bomi, Bong, Gbarpolu, Grand Bassa, Grand Cape Mount, Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Lofa, Margibi, Maryland, Montserrado, Nimba, River Cess, River Gee, and Sinoe. Each county has its own unique character, with some being more urbanized and others being more rural.</p>
        <p>The administrative structure of Liberia is designed to promote decentralization and local governance, with each county having a significant degree of autonomy. The counties are responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, while the central government is responsible for national policies and programs. This division of labor allows for more effective governance and development at the local level, and has helped to promote economic growth and stability in Liberia.</p>
