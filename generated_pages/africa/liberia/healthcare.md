[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Liberia's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a significant portion of the population relying on traditional medicine and informal healthcare services. The public sector is the main provider of healthcare services, but it faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to quality care. The private sector, on the other hand, is relatively small and caters mainly to the affluent population and foreigners. The quality of care in Liberia is generally poor, with limited access to specialized care, equipment, and medications. Urban areas, such as Monrovia, have better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where healthcare facilities are often basic and understaffed.

The Liberian government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the implementation of the **National Health Policy**, which aims to increase access to quality healthcare services and reduce health disparities. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to quality care. The **World Health Organization (WHO)** and other international organizations have provided support to Liberia to strengthen its healthcare system, including the provision of technical assistance, training, and equipment.

Despite these efforts, Liberia's healthcare system remains fragile, and the country is still recovering from the **Ebola outbreak** in 2014-2015, which highlighted the weaknesses of the healthcare system. The outbreak led to a significant increase in mortality rates, particularly among healthcare workers, and exposed the need for improved infection control practices, emergency preparedness, and response.
