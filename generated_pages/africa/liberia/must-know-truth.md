# The Truth About Liberia - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Liberia, located in West Africa, has a unique founding history. The country was established in 1822 by the American Colonization Society, a private organization based in the United States. The primary goal was to resettle freed slaves from the United States in Africa. The first group of 86 settlers arrived in Liberia on February 6, 1822. Over time, more groups of settlers arrived, and the colony grew. On July 26, 1847, Liberia declared its independence, becoming the first independent republic in Africa.

The early years of independence were marked by challenges, including conflicts with neighboring tribes and the struggle to establish a stable government. In 1877, Liberia became a **sovereign state**, recognized by the international community. The country's early history was also influenced by its relationship with the United States, which provided significant financial and military support. Liberia's **constitution**, adopted in 1847, was modeled after the United States Constitution.

During the **Scramble for Africa** in the late 19th century, Liberia managed to maintain its independence, despite being surrounded by European colonies. The country's borders were formally established through treaties with neighboring countries, including Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone. In the 20th century, Liberia experienced a period of relative stability, with a growing economy and infrastructure development. However, the country was also plagued by corruption and authoritarian rule, which ultimately led to a civil war in the 1990s.

The civil war, which lasted from 1989 to 2003, had a devastating impact on Liberia, resulting in the deaths of over 250,000 people and the displacement of many more. The war also led to significant economic decline and infrastructure destruction. In 2005, Liberia held democratic elections, which marked the beginning of a new era of peace and stability in the country. Today, Liberia continues to rebuild and develop, with a focus on economic growth, education, and healthcare.
