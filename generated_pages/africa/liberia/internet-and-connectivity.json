While major cities like Monrovia have relatively better internet access, rural areas often struggle with limited or no connectivity. The average internet speed in Liberia is around 2.5 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries. However, the country is making efforts to improve its internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber optic cables and mobile network upgrades. Despite these efforts, the internet in Liberia can be unreliable, with frequent outages and slow speeds, especially during peak hours.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Liberia is also a concern, with frequent power outages and network congestion affecting connectivity. However, the situation is improving, with more internet service providers entering the market and increasing competition. This has led to better services and more affordable prices, making it easier for people to access the internet. Additionally, the Liberian government has launched initiatives to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the development of a national broadband strategy and the establishment of a telecoms regulator.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Liberia is relatively easy, with several mobile network operators offering prepaid and postpaid plans. The main carriers in Liberia are Lonestar Cell, Orange Liberia, and MTN Liberia, all of which offer tourist-friendly plans. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and fill out a registration form. You can buy SIM cards at the airport, mobile network operator shops, or at street vendors. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, and data plans start from around 5 USD per month for 1 GB of data.\n\nThe recommended carriers for tourists are Lonestar Cell and Orange Liberia, both of which offer affordable data plans and good coverage in major cities. MTN Liberia is also a popular option, but its coverage is limited in some areas. It's worth noting that SIM cards can be bought without a registration process, but this may limit your ability to access certain services or make international calls.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lonestar Cell | Lonestar Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Orange Liberia | Orange Visitor Plan | 2 GB | 10 | Valid for 30 days |\n| MTN Liberia | MTN Tourist Plan | 500 MB | 3 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Cellcom Liberia | Cellcom Visitor Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not well-established in Liberia, but some cafes and restaurants in Monrovia offer free WiFi\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more popular in Monrovia, with several options available for remote workers\n- Public WiFi is limited, but some government buildings and public spaces offer free WiFi\n- Some restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi, especially in tourist areas\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like iLab Liberia and Liberia ICT Consortium offer reliable internet and a productive work environment\n- Reliable cafe chains like Kaldi's Coffee and Cafe De Paris offer good WiFi and a comfortable work space\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and satellite internet are available, but can be expensive\n- VPNs are recommended to secure your internet connection and protect your data\n- Some hotels and guesthouses offer co-working spaces and meeting rooms for remote workers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major concern in Liberia, but some websites may be blocked due to copyright or security reasons\n- Some social media platforms may be slow or restricted due to network congestion\n- VPNs are recommended to secure your internet connection and protect your data\n- Roaming alternatives like international SIM cards or portable WiFi hotspots can be more expensive than local SIM cards\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Liberia, but some mobile network operators offer eSIM plans for certain devices\n- Be cautious when using public WiFi or public computers, as they may be vulnerable to cyber threats and data breaches\n- Keep your devices and software up to date to protect against malware and other online threats",
