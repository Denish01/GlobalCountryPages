While the country has made significant progress in terms of stability and security, there are still concerns that travelers should be aware of. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and theft, is common in crowded areas, particularly in the capital city of Monrovia. Violent crime, including armed robbery, can also occur, especially at night. Additionally, the risk of scams, particularly those targeting foreigners, is moderate. However, with proper precautions and awareness, visitors can have a safe and enjoyable experience in Liberia.\n\nIt is essential to exercise caution when traveling to Liberia, especially when it comes to health risks. The country has a high risk of diseases such as malaria, typhoid, and cholera, and the medical infrastructure is limited.

Furthermore, visitors should be aware of their surroundings, avoid traveling alone at night, and keep valuables secure.
