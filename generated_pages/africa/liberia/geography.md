[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Liberia is a sovereign country located in West Africa, bordered by Guinea to the north, Ivory Coast to the east, and Sierra Leone to the west. The country has a coastline along the Atlantic Ocean to the south, with the capital city of Monrovia situated on the coast. Liberia's strategic location allows it to serve as a gateway to the rest of West Africa, with easy access to the region's major ports and trade routes. The country's borders are defined by a combination of natural features, such as rivers and mountains, and artificial boundaries, which were established during the colonial era.

Liberia's location in the tropics, near the equator, means that it experiences a warm and humid climate year-round. The country's coastline along the Atlantic Ocean also makes it vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes, which can bring heavy rainfall and strong winds. Despite these challenges, Liberia's location has also made it an attractive destination for traders and travelers, with a rich cultural heritage and a diverse natural environment. The country's borders with its neighboring countries are generally well-defined, although there have been some disputes over the years, particularly with regards to the border with Ivory Coast.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Liberia's terrain is characterized by a mix of coastal plains, mountains, and forests. The coastal plains are narrow and stretch along the entire coastline, with the capital city of Monrovia located on a peninsula. The mountains, which include the **Guinea Highlands**, are located in the north and east of the country, with the highest point being Mount Wuteve. The forests, which cover about 40% of the country, are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including tropical hardwoods, monkeys, and birds. The **Mano River** and the **Lofa River** are two of the country's major rivers, which flow through the mountains and forests before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.

The country's terrain has played a significant role in shaping its history and culture. The mountains and forests have provided a home for many of Liberia's indigenous communities, who have lived in the region for thousands of years. The coastal plains, on the other hand, have been the site of many historical events, including the arrival of European colonizers and the establishment of the country's capital city. Today, Liberia's terrain continues to shape the country's economy and development, with the forests and mountains providing valuable natural resources, and the coastal plains serving as a hub for trade and commerce.

The country's landscape is also characterized by a number of **wetlands** and **mangrove swamps**, which are located along the coastline and in the rivers. These ecosystems are home to a diverse range of aquatic life, including fish, shrimp, and oysters, and provide important habitat for many of the country's bird species. Liberia's terrain and landscape are also vulnerable to **deforestation** and **soil erosion**, which are major environmental concerns in the country. Efforts are being made to protect the country's natural resources and to promote sustainable land use practices, but more needs to be done to address these challenges.
