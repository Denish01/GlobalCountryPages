        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Liberia's culture is a unique blend of traditional African, American, and European influences. The country was founded in 1822 by the American Colonization Society as a settlement for freed slaves from the United States, which has had a lasting impact on the country's cultural identity. As a result, Liberia has a distinct cultural heritage that is reflected in its language, customs, and traditions. The population of Liberia is approximately 5.4 million people, with a diverse ethnic and linguistic makeup. The official language is English, but there are also over 20 indigenous languages spoken in the country.</p>
        <p>The ethnic makeup of Liberia is diverse, with over 20 different ethnic groups. The largest ethnic groups include the Kpelle, Bassa, and Grebo. Each of these groups has its own unique customs and traditions, which are reflected in the country's cultural practices. For example, the Kpelle people are known for their skilled farming and hunting practices, while the Bassa people are known for their expertise in fishing and trading. The Grebo people are known for their beautiful traditional clothing and jewelry.</p>
        <p>Liberia's cultural identity is also influenced by its history as a colony and its relationship with the United States. Many Liberians have adopted American customs and traditions, such as celebrating Thanksgiving and Independence Day. However, the country has also maintained its traditional African cultural practices, such as the use of traditional medicine and the celebration of indigenous festivals. This blend of cultures has created a unique and vibrant cultural identity that is distinct from other African countries.</p>
