The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher prices during the dry season when water and electricity demand increases. Additionally, the Liberian government has implemented measures to increase access to electricity and water, which may affect prices in the long term. However, for now, residents and businesses often rely on private providers and generators to supplement the public grid.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Liberia is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including inflation and currency exchange rates. With an inflation rate of 8.2% in 2024, prices for utilities and other goods and services may continue to rise. Furthermore, the Liberian dollar (LRD) has experienced fluctuations in value against the US dollar, which can impact the cost of imported goods and services, including utilities.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | well water or private tank options |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | mostly used for cooking |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | Libtelco, Orange Liberia |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $75-100 | 60-100 Mbps | Libtelco, Orange Liberia |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Lonestar Cell, Orange Liberia |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Lonestar Cell, Orange Liberia |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Libtelco, Orange Liberia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $9.99 | available with international payment options |\n| Spotify (premium) | $9.99 | available with international payment options |\n| Local Streaming | $5-10 | limited options available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents typically need to contact the relevant provider and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help residents manage their energy costs and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Libtelco and Orange Liberia are two of the main internet and phone service providers in Liberia, offering a range of plans and bundles.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can consider using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and negotiating with providers for better rates.\n- It is also recommended to research and compare prices among different providers to find the best deals for utilities and internet services.",
