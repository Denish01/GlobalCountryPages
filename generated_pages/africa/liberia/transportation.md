[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Liberia is accessible by air through the Roberts International Airport (ROB), which is located about 35 miles east of the capital city, Monrovia. The airport receives flights from major airlines such as Brussels Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, and Kenya Airways, with direct connections to European and African cities. If you're traveling from neighboring countries, you can also enter Liberia by land through the border crossings with Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone. The main overland entry points are at Bo Waterside, which connects to Sierra Leone, and the town of Loguatuo, which connects to Ivory Coast.

For travelers from North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, it's often necessary to connect through a major African hub like Accra, Ghana, or Nairobi, Kenya. In some cases, you may need to obtain a visa before arrival, so it's essential to check with the Liberian embassy or consulate in your home country for the latest requirements. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay in Liberia. 

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Liberia has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airlines are Liberia National Airlines and Spriggs Payne Airport, which offer flights between Monrovia and other major cities like Buchanan, Harper, and Voinjama. However, these flights are often irregular and may be suspended during the rainy season due to weather conditions. To book domestic flights, you can contact the airlines directly or work with a local travel agent. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 per person, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Liberia has no rail network, making it impossible to travel by train within the country. The lack of a rail system is due to the country's history of conflict and underdevelopment, which has hindered the construction of modern infrastructure. As a result, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus companies like Guinea-Bissau Transport and SGT operate in Liberia, offering connections between major cities like Monrovia, Buchanan, and Harper. However, the quality of these buses can vary, and the roads are often in poor condition, making for a bumpy ride. Costs for intercity bus travel range from $10 to $30 per person, depending on the route and bus company. It's essential to be prepared for delays and cancellations, especially during the rainy season.
