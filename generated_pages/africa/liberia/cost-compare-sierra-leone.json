  "content": "Liberia is generally cheaper than Sierra Leone, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiberia GDP per Capita (PPP): 774\nSierra Leone GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,540\nLiberia Inflation Rate: 21.5%\nSierra Leone Inflation Rate: 17.8%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Liberia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Liberia vs Sierra Leone [/SECTION]\nLiberia and Sierra Leone are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Liberia has a relatively lower cost of living, driven by its lower GDP per capita and higher inflation rate. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Sierra Leone has a higher GDP per capita, driven by its robust mining sector, which has led to higher prices for goods and services. Overall, Liberia is around 15-20% cheaper than Sierra Leone, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Liberia's economy is still recovering from the devastating effects of the civil war, which has led to a slower pace of economic growth. In contrast, Sierra Leone's economy has been growing steadily, driven by its mining sector, which has attracted significant foreign investment. As a result, Sierra Leone has a more developed infrastructure, which has driven up prices for goods and services. However, Liberia's lower cost of living makes it an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Liberia (USD) | Sierra Leone (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Liberia (USD) | Sierra Leone (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Liberia (USD) | Sierra Leone (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Liberia (USD) | Sierra Leone (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Liberia (USD) | Sierra Leone (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 700 | 29% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Liberia is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices around 30-40% lower than in Sierra Leone\n- Food and dining, with meal prices around 50% lower than in Sierra Leone\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices around 30-50% lower than in Sierra Leone\n- Utilities and internet, with prices around 30-50% lower than in Sierra Leone\n- **Sierra Leone is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, which may be cheaper due to Sierra Leone's more developed port infrastructure\n- Luxury items, which may be more widely available in Sierra Leone's larger cities\n- High-end dining and entertainment options, which may be more abundant in Sierra Leone\n- Certain medical services, which may be more advanced and affordable in Sierra Leone\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nLiberia offers a more affordable lifestyle, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees on a budget.
