The country experiences a dry season from June to September, with very little rainfall, and a wet season from October to May, with most of the rainfall occurring between December and February. The seasons significantly affect travel in Algeria, as the dry season can be very hot, especially in the desert regions, while the wet season can make some roads impassable. The spring and autumn seasons are generally the best times to visit Algeria, as the weather is mild and pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C.\n\nThe coastal region, where the capital city Algiers is located, has a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and warm summers. The mountainous regions, such as the Atlas Mountains, have a colder climate, with significant snowfall during the winter months. The desert regions, including the Sahara Desert, are extremely hot during the summer months, with temperatures often reaching 45°C or more.
