[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Algeria's population is significant in the African context, with the country being the largest in the continent by land area. The population has been growing steadily, with an average annual growth rate of 1.7%. This growth is largely driven by a high total fertility rate, which has been declining in recent years but remains relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 73.4% of people living in urban areas. This trend is expected to continue, with many young Algerians moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities.

The country's population is also characterized by a high proportion of young people, with approximately 28% of the population under the age of 15. This demographic trend has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large and growing youth population can put pressure on education and employment systems. However, it also presents opportunities for economic growth and development, as a young and educated workforce can drive innovation and entrepreneurship.

Algeria's population is also affected by migration patterns, with many Algerians emigrating to other countries in search of better economic opportunities. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with many Algerians living in countries such as France, Spain, and the United States. However, the country is also a destination for migrants from other African countries, with many people seeking to escape conflict or poverty in their home countries.
