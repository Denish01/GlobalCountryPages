The market is characterized by a high demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, where prices have been rising steadily. However, the market is also subject to fluctuations, and prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas.

The government has responded by launching new construction projects and encouraging private sector investment in the property sector. Despite these efforts, the market remains challenging, and buyers need to be aware of the potential risks and complexities involved in purchasing property in Algeria. The price trajectory in Algeria has been upward, with prices increasing by around 10% per year over the past few years.

Other major cities, such as Oran and Constantine, also have high prices, but the cost of living is generally lower than in Algiers.
