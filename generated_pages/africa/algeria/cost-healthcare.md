[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Algeria has a mixed healthcare system, which combines public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, with long wait times and limited resources. However, it is often free or low-cost for locals, especially for basic services. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers better quality and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. Foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare, which is generally of a higher standard. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals often relying on the public system and foreigners seeking private care.

The need for insurance in Algeria is recommended, especially for foreigners and those who want to access private healthcare. While the public system is available to everyone, it is often overcrowded and underfunded, making private insurance a necessary option for those who want to access better quality care. Additionally, many private hospitals and clinics require patients to have insurance or pay upfront, making it difficult for those without insurance to access care. The government has introduced a national health insurance scheme, which covers a range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and medications, but it is not mandatory, and many people still rely on out-of-pocket payments.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies, but may require a doctor's prescription
- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may be of varying quality
- Prices for medications vary by pharmacy and location, but are generally lower than in Western countries
- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs
- Pharmacists may not always speak English, so it's a good idea to bring a translator or learn some basic Arabic phrases
- Medications may be counterfeit or of poor quality, so it's essential to purchase from reputable pharmacies

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the emergency number, 15, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may be limited in rural areas. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally private hospitals, which offer better quality care and more English-speaking staff. Some of the top private hospitals in Algeria include the Clinique des Oliviers in Algiers and the Hospital Notre Dame d'Afrique in Oran. It's a good idea to research and identify the nearest hospital or clinic before a medical emergency arises, and to have a plan in place for emergency care, including insurance and transportation. Additionally, it's essential to be aware of the local healthcare system and the quality of care available, as well as any potential risks or challenges, such as language barriers or limited resources.
