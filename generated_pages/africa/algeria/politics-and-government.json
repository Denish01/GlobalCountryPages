  "content": "Algeria is governed as a **semi-presidential republic**, with a mix of presidential and parliamentary powers, and a complex system of governance that has undergone significant changes in recent years. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Semi-Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President (Abdelmadjid Tebboune)\nHead of Government: Prime Minister (Aymen Benabderrahmane)\nLegislature: People's National Assembly, bicameral (Council of the Nation and National People's Assembly), 462 seats\nLegal System: Civil law, with influences from **Sharia law** and **French law**\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 111 out of 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 104 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe Algerian government is characterized by a **semi-presidential system**, where the President serves as the head of state and has significant executive powers, while the Prime Minister is the head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term, and is limited to two terms. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, is appointed by the President and is responsible for appointing the cabinet. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. However, in practice, the executive branch has historically dominated the political landscape. Algeria has a **unitary system**, with a strong central government and limited autonomy for regional authorities.\n\nThe **Constitution of Algeria**, adopted in 1996 and amended several times since, outlines the framework for the country's governance. It establishes the principles of **democracy**, **sovereignty**, and **social justice**, and guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association. However, the constitution also grants significant powers to the President and the executive branch, which has led to concerns about **authoritarianism** and **human rights** abuses.\n\nThe **political culture** in Algeria is complex and multifaceted, with a mix of **Arab nationalism**, **Islamism**, and **socialism**. The country has a long history of **anti-colonial struggle**, and the legacy of this struggle continues to shape its politics and identity. However, the country has also faced significant challenges, including **corruption**, **inequality**, and **unemployment**, which have contributed to **social unrest** and **political instability**.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Abdelmadjid Tebboune | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Aymen Benabderrahmane | Head of government and cabinet |\n| Legislative | People's National Assembly | Speaker Ibrahim Boughali | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Judicial review and interpretation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Liberation Front (FLN) | Center-left | Abou El Fadl Baadji | 98 | Historically dominant party |\n| National Rally for Democracy (RND) | Center-right | Ahmed Ouyahia | 100 | Junior partner in ruling coalition |\n| Green Algeria Alliance | Islamist | Bouguerra Soltani | 49 | Coalition of Islamist parties |\n| Socialist Forces Front (FFS) | Left-wing | Youcef Aouchiche | 14 | Opposition party with socialist roots |\n| Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) | Liberal | Mohcine Belabbes | 9 | Secular opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Algeria is based on a **mixed system**, with both single-member districts and proportional representation.\n- Elections are held every five years for the President and the People's National Assembly.\n- The last presidential election was held in 2019, and the next election is scheduled for 2024.\n- Voter participation has been relatively low in recent elections, with turnout rates ranging from 30% to 50%.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Algeria faces significant **political instability**, with ongoing protests and demands for reform.\n- The country has struggled with **corruption** and **nepotism**, which have undermined trust in institutions.\n- The **economy** is heavily dependent on **oil and gas exports**, which has made it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\n- **Regional dynamics**, including the **Libyan conflict** and **Western Sahara dispute**, have also posed challenges for Algeria's foreign policy.\n- The country has been ranked as \"partly free\" by Freedom House, with concerns about **human rights** and **press freedom**.\n- Algeria has also faced **security threats**, including **terrorism** and **cyber attacks**, which have required significant investments in defense and security.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Algeria is a member of the **United Nations**, the **African Union**, and the **Arab League**, and has played an active role in regional and international affairs.\n- The country has close **diplomatic relations** with **France**, **China**, and **Russia**, and has sought to diversify its economic partnerships.\n- Algeria has also been a key player in **regional security initiatives**, including the **Sahel Region's G5** and the **African Union's Peace and Security Council**.\n- The country has a complex relationship with **Morocco**, with which it has a longstanding **border dispute** and competing claims to **Western Sahara**.\n- Algeria has also been a strong supporter of **Palestinian rights** and has been critical of **Israeli policies** in the region.",
