[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Algerian property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by government investments in infrastructure and a growing middle class. The market is characterized by a high demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, where prices have been rising steadily. However, the market is also subject to fluctuations, and prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas. The government has implemented various initiatives to encourage foreign investment in the property sector, including the creation of special economic zones and the introduction of new regulations to simplify the buying process.

The current market conditions in Algeria are marked by a shortage of housing, particularly in the affordable segment, which has led to an increase in prices. The government has responded by launching new construction projects and encouraging private sector investment in the property sector. Despite these efforts, the market remains challenging, and buyers need to be aware of the potential risks and complexities involved in purchasing property in Algeria. The price trajectory in Algeria has been upward, with prices increasing by around 10% per year over the past few years. However, the market is expected to slow down in the coming years, as the government implements measures to control prices and increase the supply of housing.

The urban-rural divide is a significant factor in the Algerian property market, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas. The capital city, Algiers, is the most expensive city in the country, with prices ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 per square meter. Other major cities, such as Oran and Constantine, also have high prices, but the cost of living is generally lower than in Algiers. Rural areas, on the other hand, are generally less expensive, with prices ranging from $500 to $1,000 per square meter.
