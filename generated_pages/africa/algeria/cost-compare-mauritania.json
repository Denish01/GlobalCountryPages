  "content": "Algeria is generally cheaper than Mauritania, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20% in favor of Algeria.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAlgeria GDP per Capita (PPP): 15,400\nMauritania GDP per Capita (PPP): 4,500\nAlgeria Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nMauritania Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Algeria\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Algeria vs Mauritania [/SECTION]\nAlgeria and Mauritania are two neighboring countries in North Africa with distinct economic profiles. Algeria has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on oil and gas production, while Mauritania's economy is primarily driven by mining and fishing. The cost of living in Algeria is generally lower than in Mauritania, with prices for food, housing, and transportation being relatively cheaper. However, the cost of living in Mauritania can vary greatly depending on the location, with the capital city of Nouakchott being more expensive than other parts of the country.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Algeria has a more developed infrastructure and a larger economy, which contributes to its lower prices. On the other hand, Mauritania's economy is smaller and more vulnerable to external shocks, which can lead to higher prices and a more unpredictable cost of living. Overall, Algeria is generally around 15-20% cheaper than Mauritania, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a affordable place to live in North Africa.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Algeria (USD) | Mauritania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Algeria (USD) | Mauritania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Algeria (USD) | Mauritania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.50 | 0.75 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Algeria (USD) | Mauritania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 75 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Algeria (USD) | Mauritania (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 700 | 29% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Algeria is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices being around 30-40% lower than in Mauritania\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries being around 30-50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with taxis and fuel being around 33-50% cheaper\n- Utilities and internet, with prices being around 30-50% lower\n- **Mauritania is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, which can be cheaper due to Mauritania's lower import duties\n- Fresh seafood, which is abundant and relatively cheap in Mauritania\n- Traditional clothing and handicrafts, which can be found at lower prices in Mauritania's markets\n- Certain tourist activities, such as desert tours and fishing trips, which can be cheaper in Mauritania\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees looking for a affordable place to live in North Africa, Algeria is generally the better option.
