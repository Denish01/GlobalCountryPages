# Algeria Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Algeria before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Algeria has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of around 10 countries, including Malaysia, Morocco, and Tunisia, can enter Algeria visa-free for up to 90 days. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country. The Algerian government has introduced an e-visa system to simplify the application process for eligible nationalities.

The visa policy is designed to balance the country's security concerns with the need to promote tourism and economic development. Visitors can apply for a visa at an Algerian embassy or consulate, or through the e-visa portal. The processing time and requirements vary depending on the type of visa and nationality. It is essential to check the official government website or consult with the embassy or consulate for the latest information on visa requirements and application procedures.
