[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Algeria is divided into two main sectors: public and private. Public education is free and subsidized by the government, but the quality can vary depending on the region and the school. Private education, on the other hand, is generally of higher quality, but it can be expensive. The language of instruction in public schools is Arabic, while private schools may use French or English as a secondary language. Compulsory education in Algeria lasts for 9 years, from the age of 6 to 15. International schools are also available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.

The quality of education in Algeria has been improving in recent years, with the government investing more in the education sector. However, there are still some challenges, such as overcrowding and a lack of resources in some public schools. Private schools, on the other hand, often have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but they can be expensive. International schools are a good option for expats and those who want a more Western-style education. These schools often have a more diverse student body and a range of extracurricular activities.
