[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Algeria's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers across the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. The private sector is also well-developed, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, particularly in specialties such as cardiology and orthopedics.

The Ministry of Health, Population, and Hospital Reform is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, and has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas. Despite these efforts, however, Algeria's healthcare system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical personnel, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care. In addition, the system is often bureaucratic and inefficient, with long waiting times and limited availability of certain medications and treatments.

Overall, while Algeria's healthcare system has made significant progress in recent years, it still has a way to go in terms of providing high-quality, accessible care to all citizens. Expats and foreigners may find that private hospitals and clinics offer better care and more amenities, but may also be more expensive. It is essential to have good health insurance coverage when living or traveling in Algeria, as medical costs can be high and access to care may be limited in some areas.
