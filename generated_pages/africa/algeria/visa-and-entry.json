[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nAlgeria has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of around 10 countries, including Malaysia, Morocco, and Tunisia, can enter Algeria visa-free for up to 90 days. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country. The Algerian government has introduced an e-visa system to simplify the application process for eligible nationalities.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the country's security concerns with the need to promote tourism and economic development. Visitors can apply for a visa at an Algerian embassy or consulate, or through the e-visa portal. The processing time and requirements vary depending on the type of visa and nationality. It is essential to check the official government website or consult with the embassy or consulate for the latest information on visa requirements and application procedures.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Must apply at an Algerian embassy or consulate |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Can apply for an e-visa |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Can apply for an e-visa, except for citizens of France, Spain, and Italy, who can enter visa-free |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Must apply at an Algerian embassy or consulate |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 90 days | Can apply for an e-visa |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply at an Algerian embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply at an Algerian embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a single-entry or multiple-entry visa, which is usually valid for 90 days.
