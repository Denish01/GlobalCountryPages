  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Algeria can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: DZD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nAlgeria's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with a high percentage of the population having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the summer months leading to increased prices. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities can still vary significantly depending on the region and usage patterns. Additionally, the quality of utility services can differ between urban and rural areas, with cities like Algiers and Oran tend to have more reliable and efficient services.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Algeria is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including inflation and currency fluctuations. With an inflation rate of 4.0% in 2024, the cost of utilities is likely to increase over time. Furthermore, the government's efforts to reduce subsidies and increase efficiency in the utility sector may lead to changes in pricing and service quality. As a result, it is essential for consumers to stay informed about the latest developments and adjust their usage patterns accordingly.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in rent or separate bill) |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$135** | **$195** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Algerie Telecom, Ooredoo |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | Algerie Telecom, Ooredoo |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Ooredoo, Mobilis |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Ooredoo, Mobilis |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Algerie Telecom, Ooredoo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in Algeria |\n| Spotify (premium) | $5 | available in Algeria |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Dzair TV, Beur TV |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Algeria, it is recommended to contact the local providers, such as Algerie Telecom or Ooredoo, and provide the necessary documents, including a copy of the rental agreement and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience.\n- The best internet providers in Algeria are Algerie Telecom and Ooredoo, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, consumers can consider reducing their energy consumption, using energy-efficient appliances, and taking advantage of off-peak rates.\n- It is also essential to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure the best value for money, as prices and offers can change over time.",
