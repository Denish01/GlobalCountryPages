[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Algeria has experienced significant growth in recent years, with the number of internet users increasing rapidly.

In cities like Algiers and Oran, internet speeds are generally good, with many cafes, hotels, and restaurants offering **WiFi** connections. However, in rural areas, internet access can be limited, and speeds can be slower.

Despite these challenges, the Algerian government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to rural areas and improving the overall quality of the internet. This has led to an increase in the number of internet users, with many Algerians now using the internet for a variety of purposes, including education, business, and social media. However, the internet in Algeria can still be unreliable at times, with outages and slow speeds common, especially during peak hours.
