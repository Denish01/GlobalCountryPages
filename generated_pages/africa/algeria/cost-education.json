  "content": "The cost of education in Algeria varies depending on the type of institution and the level of study, with public education being generally free or subsidized, while private and international schools can range from $1,000 to $10,000 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 5.6%\nLiteracy Rate: 80%\nSchool System: 9 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: DZD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Algeria is divided into two main sectors: public and private. Public education is free and subsidized by the government, but the quality can vary depending on the region and the school. Private education, on the other hand, is generally of higher quality, but it can be expensive. The language of instruction in public schools is Arabic, while private schools may use French or English as a secondary language. Compulsory education in Algeria lasts for 9 years, from the age of 6 to 15. International schools are also available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.\n\nThe quality of education in Algeria has been improving in recent years, with the government investing more in the education sector. However, there are still some challenges, such as overcrowding and a lack of resources in some public schools. Private schools, on the other hand, often have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but they can be expensive. International schools are a good option for expats and those who want a more Western-style education. These schools often have a more diverse student body and a range of extracurricular activities.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, overcrowding |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Better facilities, more qualified teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, overcrowding |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Better facilities, more qualified teachers |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | IB, GCSE, and other international curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited programs, overcrowding |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Better facilities, more qualified teachers |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$3,000 | $2,500-$5,000 | University of Algiers, limited programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Limited availability, especially outside major cities |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Popular for exam preparation, language lessons |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Arabic, French, English, and other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, such as notebooks, pens, and pencils |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for most public and private schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats are often international schools, which offer a more Western-style education and a range of extracurricular activities.\n- Scholarships are available for students who want to study at public universities, but they are limited and competitive.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular in Algeria, especially for language courses and professional development.\n- The quality of education in Algeria is generally lower than in other countries in the region, but it has been improving in recent years.\n- The University of Algiers is one of the top-ranked universities in the country, offering a range of programs in fields such as engineering, medicine, and law.\n- **Language skills** are highly valued in Algeria, and students who speak multiple languages, including Arabic, French, and English, have a significant advantage in the job market.",
