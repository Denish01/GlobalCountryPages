The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent services and affordable fares. Most people in Algeria get around using public transportation, with buses and taxis being the most popular modes. The country's large size and geographical diversity mean that transportation costs can vary significantly depending on the region and mode of transport.\n\nThe government has invested heavily in improving the transportation infrastructure, with new roads, highways, and public transportation systems being built. However, traffic congestion is a major problem in urban areas, particularly in Algiers, and can significantly increase travel times. Despite this, Algeria's transportation network is relatively well-developed compared to other countries in the region, making it relatively easy to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.25 | $10 | Good coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.50 | $15 | Limited to Algiers, Oran, and Constantine |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50 | N/A | Routes cover most urban areas |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-2.00 | $20 | Limited to major cities, infrequent services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.25 | $5-10 | Be sure to agree on the fare before starting |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.30 | $5-15 | Yassir and Temtem are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.60 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.55 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-10 | Limited to major highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Depending on route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | Typical route, depending on airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-50 | Limited to major cities, infrequent services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or shared taxis, which are often cheaper than metered taxis or ride-hailing apps.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Yassir or Temtem to book taxis or private cars, as they often offer competitive prices and convenient services.\n- Be sure to agree on the fare before starting a taxi ride, as some drivers may try to overcharge.\n- Avoid traveling during peak hours or rush hour, as traffic congestion can significantly increase travel times.\n- Consider renting a car for long-distance travel, as it can be more convenient and cost-effective than taking public transportation.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic laws to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.",
