[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Algeria is located in the northeastern part of Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea to the north. It is situated between Morocco to the west and Tunisia to the east, with Libya to the southeast, Niger and Mali to the south, and Mauritania and Western Sahara to the southwest. The country has a long coastline along the Mediterranean, with several important ports, including the capital city of Algiers. The strategic location of Algeria has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

Algeria's borders with its neighboring countries are largely defined by natural features, such as the Atlas Mountains to the north and the Sahara Desert to the south. The country's border with Morocco has been a subject of dispute, with both countries claiming sovereignty over the Western Sahara region. Algeria's border with Libya has also been affected by the instability in the region, with smuggling and terrorism posing significant security challenges. Despite these challenges, Algeria has maintained good relations with its neighboring countries, with which it shares cultural and historical ties.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Algeria's terrain is diverse, with mountains, deserts, and coastal plains. The **Atlas Mountains** stretch along the northern coast, with several peaks exceeding 2,000 meters in elevation. The highest point in the country, **Mount Tahat**, is located in the Ahaggar Mountains in the southern part of the country. The **Sahara Desert** covers much of the southern and central regions of Algeria, with vast expanses of sand dunes and rocky plateaus. The desert region is home to several important oases, including the **Tassili n'Ajjer** and **Hoggar Mountains**, which are known for their unique rock formations and prehistoric rock art.

The coastal region of Algeria is characterized by a narrow strip of fertile land, known as the **Tell**, which is home to the majority of the country's population. The Tell is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Atlas Mountains to the south, and is drained by several important rivers, including the **Chelif** and **Seybouse**. The coastal region is also home to several important ports, including Algiers, Oran, and Bejaia. The **Hodna Basin** is a large inland depression in the northeastern part of the country, which is surrounded by mountains and is home to several important agricultural regions.

Algeria's landscape has been shaped by its complex geological history, with several major tectonic events having occurred in the region over millions of years. The country is also home to several important natural resources, including **oil**, **gas**, and **minerals**, which have played a significant role in the country's economy. The diverse terrain and climate of Algeria have also supported a wide range of flora and fauna, with several unique and endemic species found in the country.
