[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Algerian government is characterized by a **semi-presidential system**, where the President serves as the head of state and has significant executive powers, while the Prime Minister is the head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term, and is limited to two terms. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, is appointed by the President and is responsible for appointing the cabinet. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. However, in practice, the executive branch has historically dominated the political landscape. Algeria has a **unitary system**, with a strong central government and limited autonomy for regional authorities.

The **Constitution of Algeria**, adopted in 1996 and amended several times since, outlines the framework for the country's governance. It establishes the principles of **democracy**, **sovereignty**, and **social justice**, and guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association. However, the constitution also grants significant powers to the President and the executive branch, which has led to concerns about **authoritarianism** and **human rights** abuses.

The **political culture** in Algeria is complex and multifaceted, with a mix of **Arab nationalism**, **Islamism**, and **socialism**. The country has a long history of **anti-colonial struggle**, and the legacy of this struggle continues to shape its politics and identity. However, the country has also faced significant challenges, including **corruption**, **inequality**, and **unemployment**, which have contributed to **social unrest** and **political instability**.
