[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Algeria has a well-developed transportation network, with various modes of transport available, including buses, taxis, and trains. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent services and affordable fares. Most people in Algeria get around using public transportation, with buses and taxis being the most popular modes. The country's large size and geographical diversity mean that transportation costs can vary significantly depending on the region and mode of transport.
