        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Algeria has an upper-middle-income economy, driven primarily by its vast natural resources, particularly petroleum and natural gas. The country's economic classification is based on its high per capita income and significant industrial sector. Algeria's economy has been growing steadily over the years, with a mix of state-led and private sector-driven development. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a lack of diversification in its economy. The government has been working to implement economic reforms and promote private sector growth, but progress has been slow.</p>
        <p>Algeria's economic development level is considered to be relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The country has a well-developed infrastructure, including a comprehensive road network, a modern telecommunications system, and a number of major ports and airports. However, the economy is still heavily dependent on the hydrocarbon sector, which accounts for the majority of the country's exports and government revenue. The government has been working to diversify the economy and promote growth in other sectors, such as manufacturing and tourism.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges it faces, Algeria's economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by its significant natural resources and strategic location. The country is a key player in the regional economy and has significant trade relationships with other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
