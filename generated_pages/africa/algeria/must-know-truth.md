# The Truth About Algeria - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Algeria's history dates back to the **Neolithic period**, with various cultures and empires rising and falling over the centuries. The **Phoenicians** established trade posts and cities along the coast in the 10th century BC, followed by the **Romans**, who annexed the region in the 2nd century BC. The **Arab conquest** of the 7th century AD introduced **Islam**, which would become a dominant force in Algerian culture and identity. The **Ottoman Empire** ruled Algeria from the 16th to the 19th century, until the country was colonized by **France** in 1830. Algeria gained independence on July 5, 1962, after a long and bloody **Algerian War of Independence**.

The country's early years of independence were marked by a socialist-oriented government, with **Ahmed Ben Bella** as the first president. However, a military coup in 1965 led by **Houari Boumediene** brought an end to the country's early experiments with democracy. The 1980s saw a rise in **Islamic fundamentalism**, which would eventually lead to a decade-long **civil war** in the 1990s. The conflict pitted the government against various **Islamist groups**, resulting in significant loss of life and displacement.
