[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Central African Republic is struggling to provide quality education to its citizens, with a significant gap between public and private institutions. Public schools are generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in low quality education, while private schools offer better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily French, with some Sango also being used. Compulsory education lasts for 8 years, from age 6 to 14, but many children, especially in rural areas, do not have access to education due to lack of schools, poverty, and conflict. International schools are available in the capital city, Bangui, but are generally expensive and cater to the children of expatriates and wealthy locals.

The education system in Central African Republic faces many challenges, including a lack of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of educational materials. The country has a **national education plan** that aims to improve the quality of education and increase access to education, especially for girls and children in rural areas. However, the implementation of this plan is hindered by a lack of funding and resources. Despite these challenges, there are some **private schools** and **international institutions** that offer high-quality education, but these are generally expensive and out of reach for most citizens.
