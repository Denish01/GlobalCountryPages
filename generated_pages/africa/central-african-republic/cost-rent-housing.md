[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Central African Republic is relatively small and mostly caters to expatriates, aid workers, and government officials. Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and it is essential to have a comprehensive lease agreement in place to avoid disputes. Compared to regional neighbors, housing costs in Central African Republic are relatively high due to the country's limited infrastructure and security concerns. However, the cost of living in general is lower compared to countries like Cameroon and the Republic of Congo.

The housing market in Central African Republic is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a GDP per capita of $1,263 and an inflation rate of 1.5%. The education and healthcare sectors are underfunded, with only 1.8% of GDP allocated to education and $54 per capita spent on healthcare. This has resulted in a shortage of skilled labor and limited access to quality healthcare, which can impact the overall cost of living and housing costs. The government is working to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, which could lead to an increase in housing demand and prices in the future.
