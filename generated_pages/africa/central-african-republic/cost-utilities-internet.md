[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Central African Republic is still developing, with many areas lacking access to reliable electricity and clean water. As a result, utility costs can be relatively high, especially for those who rely on private providers or generators. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season. Additionally, the country's economy has been affected by inflation, which can impact the cost of utilities and other essential services.

The Central African Republic has a relatively low GDP per capita PPP of $1,263, which can make it challenging for many residents to afford basic utilities. However, the government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the electricity grid and the development of new water treatment plants. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, with some families spending up to 20% of their income on electricity, water, and other essential services.
