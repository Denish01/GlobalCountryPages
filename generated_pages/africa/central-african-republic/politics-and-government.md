[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Central African Republic's government is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The president serves as the head of state and head of government, and is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The National Assembly, which is composed of 140 members elected by proportional representation, has the power to pass laws and approve the government's budget. The country has a **unitary system**, where the central government holds significant power and authority, with limited autonomy granted to local governments.

The Central African Republic's political system has been marked by instability and conflict, with the country experiencing several coups and rebellions since gaining independence in 1960. The current government has been working to stabilize the country and promote economic development, but faces significant challenges, including poverty, corruption, and insecurity. The **separation of powers** is intended to provide checks and balances on the power of the executive, but in practice, the president has significant influence over the legislative and judicial branches.

The country's **political culture** is characterized by a strong sense of nationalism and a desire for stability and security. However, the government faces significant challenges in providing basic services to its citizens, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The **civil law** system is based on the French model, and provides a framework for the administration of justice and the protection of individual rights.
