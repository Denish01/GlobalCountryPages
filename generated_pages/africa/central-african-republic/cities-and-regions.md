[SECTION] How Central African Republic Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Central African Republic is divided into 16 prefectures, 1 economic prefecture, and 1 commune. The prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures, which are then divided into communes. The country's administrative structure is designed to provide a framework for governance and development at the local level. The prefectures are responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, while the sub-prefectures and communes focus on community development and local governance.

The country's administrative divisions are also influenced by its geography and climate. The northern regions are generally drier and more sparsely populated, while the southern regions are more fertile and densely populated. The economic prefecture of Nana-Mambéré is located in the western part of the country and is known for its rich natural resources, including gold and diamonds. The commune of Bangui is the country's capital and largest city, and is home to many government institutions and international organizations.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
The Central African Republic has a limited transportation network, with few paved roads and limited access to domestic flights. The country's main airport is located in Bangui, and offers flights to several regional destinations, including Brazzaville, Douala, and Kinshasa. There are also several bus companies that operate throughout the country, offering transportation to major cities and towns. However, the road conditions are often poor, and travel can be slow and uncomfortable. For visitors who prefer to drive, car rental companies are available in Bangui, but driving conditions can be challenging, especially during the rainy season. [CALLOUT] It is recommended to use reputable transportation companies and to exercise caution when traveling in the country, especially at night or in remote areas.
