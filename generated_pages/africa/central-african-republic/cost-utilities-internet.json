As a result, utility costs can be relatively high, especially for those who rely on private providers or generators. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season. Additionally, the country's economy has been affected by inflation, which can impact the cost of utilities and other essential services.\n\nThe Central African Republic has a relatively low GDP per capita PPP of $1,263, which can make it challenging for many residents to afford basic utilities. However, the government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the electricity grid and the development of new water treatment plants. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, with some families spending up to 20% of their income on electricity, water, and other essential services.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (limited availability) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in rent or separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$160** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Moov, Orange |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 60 Mbps | Moov, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Moov, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Moov, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Moov, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | (available in some areas) |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | (available in some areas) |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited availability) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's recommended to contact the provider directly or work with a local real estate agent to facilitate the process.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are widely available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience for some users.\n- Moov and Orange are two of the largest internet and phone providers in Central African Republic, offering a range of plans and services.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and negotiating with providers for better rates.\n- Be aware of seasonal variations in utility costs and plan accordingly to avoid unexpected expenses.",
