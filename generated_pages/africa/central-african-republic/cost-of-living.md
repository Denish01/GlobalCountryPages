[SECTION] How Expensive Is Central African Republic? [/SECTION]
The Central African Republic is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is lower compared to many other countries in the world. The country's economy has been affected by years of conflict and instability, which has led to a relatively low cost of living. However, prices can vary depending on the location, with the capital city Bangui tend to be more expensive than other parts of the country. Compared to its neighbors, the Central African Republic is generally cheaper than Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, but more expensive than Chad and South Sudan.

The cost of living in the Central African Republic is also influenced by the country's limited infrastructure and lack of modern amenities. This can make it challenging for visitors and expats to find high-quality goods and services, particularly outside of Bangui. However, for those who are willing to adapt to the local way of life, the Central African Republic can be a very affordable place to live or visit. With a daily budget of $20-40 USD, backpackers can find basic accommodation and eat at local eateries, while mid-range travelers can enjoy more comfortable accommodation and dining options for $40-80 USD per day.
