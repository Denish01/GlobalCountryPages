This makes it challenging to stream videos, make video calls, or access cloud services. The urban-rural divide is also significant, with the capital city Bangui having better internet connectivity than rural areas. However, even in Bangui, the internet can be unreliable, with frequent outages and disconnections. The poor internet infrastructure is largely due to the country's limited investment in telecommunications and the lack of competition among internet service providers.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Central African Republic is also a concern, with frequent power outages and poor network maintenance affecting the quality of service. Additionally, the country's geography, with dense forests and remote areas, makes it difficult to establish and maintain a reliable internet network. As a result, internet users in Central African Republic often have to rely on mobile networks, which can be slow and expensive. Despite these challenges, there are efforts to improve the internet infrastructure in the country, with some internet service providers investing in new technologies and expanding their coverage.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Central African Republic, tourists can visit the offices of the main carriers, such as Moov, Orange, and Telecel, which are usually located in the capital city Bangui.
