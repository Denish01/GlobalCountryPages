The prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures, which are then divided into communes. The country's administrative structure is designed to provide a framework for governance and development at the local level. The prefectures are responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, while the sub-prefectures and communes focus on community development and local governance.\n\nThe country's administrative divisions are also influenced by its geography and climate. The northern regions are generally drier and more sparsely populated, while the southern regions are more fertile and densely populated. The economic prefecture of Nana-Mambéré is located in the western part of the country and is known for its rich natural resources, including gold and diamonds. The commune of Bangui is the country's capital and largest city, and is home to many government institutions and international organizations.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Bangui** (population 750,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its vibrant markets, historic landmarks, and cultural festivals\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and urban life\n\n**Bimbo** (population 250,000)\nRole: economic hub, transportation center\nKnown For: its bustling markets, nightlife, and proximity to the capital\nBest For: business travelers, traders, and adventurers\n\n**Mbaïki** (population 100,000)\nRole: regional hub, agricultural center\nKnown For: its fertile soil, agricultural production, and traditional crafts\nBest For: visitors interested in rural life, agriculture, and local culture\n\n**Berbérati** (population 80,000)\nRole: regional hub, economic center\nKnown For: its rich natural resources, including gold and diamonds\nBest For: business travelers, miners, and adventurers\n\n**Kaga-Bandoro** (population 50,000)\nRole: regional hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, cultural festivals, and traditional music\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and local traditions\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Basse-Kotto | fertile, densely populated | agricultural production, traditional crafts | Mobaye |\n| Haute-Kotto | mountainous, sparsely populated | gold and diamond mining, traditional music | Bria |\n| Kémo | tropical, densely populated | coffee and cotton production, vibrant markets | Sibut |\n| Lobaye | fertile, densely populated | agricultural production, cultural festivals | Mbaïki |\n| Mbomou | tropical, sparsely populated | gold and diamond mining, traditional crafts | Bangassou |\n| Nana-Mambéré | dry, sparsely populated | gold and diamond mining, traditional music | Bouar |\n| Ombella-Mpoko | fertile, densely populated | agricultural production, cultural festivals | Bimbo |\n| Ouaka | tropical, densely populated | coffee and cotton production, vibrant markets | Bambari |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The northern regions are generally drier and more sparsely populated, with a stronger influence from neighboring countries such as Chad and Sudan.\n- The southern regions are more fertile and densely populated, with a stronger focus on agricultural production and cultural festivals.\n- The western regions are known for their rich natural resources, including gold and diamonds, and are home to many mining communities.\n- The eastern regions are more remote and sparsely populated, with a stronger focus on traditional crafts and local culture.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nThe Central African Republic has a limited transportation network, with few paved roads and limited access to domestic flights. The country's main airport is located in Bangui, and offers flights to several regional destinations, including Brazzaville, Douala, and Kinshasa. There are also several bus companies that operate throughout the country, offering transportation to major cities and towns. However, the road conditions are often poor, and travel can be slow and uncomfortable. For visitors who prefer to drive, car rental companies are available in Bangui, but driving conditions can be challenging, especially during the rainy season. [CALLOUT] It is recommended to use reputable transportation companies and to exercise caution when traveling in the country, especially at night or in remote areas.",
