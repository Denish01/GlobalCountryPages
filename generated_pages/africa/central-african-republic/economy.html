        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>The Central African Republic (CAR) has a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $440. The country's economic development is hindered by its landlocked location, lack of infrastructure, and ongoing conflict. The economy is primarily driven by the agricultural sector, which accounts for the majority of the country's employment and GDP. The CAR is also rich in natural resources, including diamonds, gold, and uranium, which provide a significant source of revenue for the government. However, the country's economy has been severely impacted by years of instability and conflict, which has limited investment, disrupted trade, and led to a decline in economic activity.</p>
        <p>The CAR's economic classification is that of a least developed country, with a low level of economic development. The country faces significant challenges in terms of poverty, inequality, and access to basic services such as healthcare and education. The government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting economic development, including the creation of a national development plan and the establishment of a ministry of economy and planning. However, the country's economic trajectory remains uncertain, and it will require significant investment and support from the international community to achieve sustainable economic growth.</p>
        <p>The CAR's economy is also heavily reliant on foreign aid, with the majority of its budget being financed by international donors. The country has received significant support from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which have provided financing and technical assistance to help the government implement economic reforms and promote economic development. However, the country's economic progress is fragile and can be easily disrupted by external shocks, such as changes in global commodity prices or conflicts in neighboring countries.</p>

        <h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
        <p>The CAR's economic outlook is uncertain, with the country facing significant challenges in terms of poverty, inequality, and access to basic services.

However, the country's economic progress is fragile and can be easily disrupted by external shocks, such as changes in global commodity prices or conflicts in neighboring countries. The CAR will require significant investment and support from the international community to achieve sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty.</p>
        <p>The government has identified several priority areas for economic development, including the development of the country's infrastructure, the promotion of agriculture and mining, and the improvement of access to basic services such as healthcare and education. The country is also seeking to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on a few key sectors, such as agriculture and mining. The CAR has significant potential for economic growth and development, with its rich natural resources and strategic location in the heart of Africa. However, the country will need to address its significant challenges and risks, including poverty, inequality, and conflict, in order to achieve its economic potential.</p>
