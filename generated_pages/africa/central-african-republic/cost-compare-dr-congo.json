The Central African Republic has a relatively low GDP per capita and a moderate inflation rate, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, the DR Congo has a higher GDP per capita and a slightly higher inflation rate, resulting in a more expensive cost of living.

This is largely due to the lower cost of housing, food, and transportation in the Central African Republic.
