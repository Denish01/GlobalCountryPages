[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Central African Republic is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and infrastructure, resulting in variable quality of care. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality services, but at a significantly higher cost, making them inaccessible to many locals. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek private healthcare services, as they are more likely to meet international standards. Insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help mitigate the financial risks associated with healthcare costs.

The healthcare system in Central African Republic is also characterized by a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. As a result, many people rely on traditional medicine and community-based healthcare services. The government has implemented initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, but more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare sector. For locals, the healthcare system is often a challenge to navigate, with long waiting times, limited availability of medications, and variable quality of care. In contrast, foreigners often have access to better quality care, but at a higher cost, and may need to seek medical evacuation to neighboring countries or Europe for specialized care.
