  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Central African Republic can vary significantly, with an average health expenditure per capita of $54, and out-of-pocket spend accounting for 45% of total health expenditure, indicating a substantial financial burden on individuals and families.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $54\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 45.0%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 117\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XAF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Central African Republic is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and infrastructure, resulting in variable quality of care. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality services, but at a significantly higher cost, making them inaccessible to many locals. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek private healthcare services, as they are more likely to meet international standards. Insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help mitigate the financial risks associated with healthcare costs.\n\nThe healthcare system in Central African Republic is also characterized by a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. As a result, many people rely on traditional medicine and community-based healthcare services. The government has implemented initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, but more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare sector. For locals, the healthcare system is often a challenge to navigate, with long waiting times, limited availability of medications, and variable quality of care. In contrast, foreigners often have access to better quality care, but at a higher cost, and may need to seek medical evacuation to neighboring countries or Europe for specialized care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Variable quality of care |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Limited availability of specialists |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | Limited availability of dental services |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-30 | Limited availability of eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $30-50 | Variable quality of laboratory services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Variable quality of care |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-100 | Limited availability of hospital beds |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-500 | Limited availability of surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-200 | Limited availability of maternal healthcare services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-500 | Limited availability of diagnostic imaging services |\n| X-Ray | $20-50 | Variable quality of radiology services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-20 | Outpatient care, limited hospitalization |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Inpatient and outpatient care, including specialist consultations and diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-500 | Comprehensive coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Essential medications** such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available, but may be counterfeit or of variable quality\n- **Prescription medications** are required for some medications, but may not always be enforced\n- **Pharmacy availability** is limited in rural areas, with many people relying on informal markets or traditional medicine\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available, but may not always be safe or effective\n- **Vaccinations** are available, but may not always be up-to-date or widely available\n- **Medication costs** can be high, especially for chronic conditions, and may be a significant burden on individuals and families\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek immediate attention at a hospital or clinic. The emergency number is 117, but response times may be variable, and ambulance services may not always be available. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek care at a private hospital or clinic, as they are more likely to meet international standards. The best hospitals for foreigners are often located in the capital city, Bangui, and may include the **Hôpital Général de Référence** and the **Clinique des Nations Unies**. However, even in these facilities, the quality of care may be variable, and medical evacuation to neighboring countries or Europe may be necessary for specialized care. It is essential to have a plan in place for emergency care, including insurance coverage and a means of communication, to ensure access to timely and effective medical attention.",
