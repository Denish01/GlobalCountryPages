[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Central African Republic is structured into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Primary education, which is compulsory, lasts for 6 years and is followed by 4 years of secondary education. The quality of education varies significantly between public and private institutions, with private schools generally offering better facilities and more qualified teachers. However, private education is not accessible to a large portion of the population due to high costs. The public education system is plagued by a lack of resources, including textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers, which negatively impacts the quality of education.

The education system in Central African Republic faces numerous challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to education in rural areas, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including the introduction of free primary education and the construction of new schools. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in education between urban and rural areas, as well as between public and private institutions.

The tertiary education system in Central African Republic is limited, with only a few institutions offering higher education programs. The University of Bangui is the largest and most prominent university in the country, offering a range of programs in fields such as medicine, law, and engineering. However, the university faces significant challenges, including a lack of resources and limited access to technology.
