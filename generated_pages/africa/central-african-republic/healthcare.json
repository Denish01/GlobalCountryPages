  "content": "Healthcare in Central African Republic is a challenging and under-resourced system, with limited access to quality medical facilities and services, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 117\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Central African Republic has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering medical services. However, the overall quality of care is relatively low due to inadequate funding, lack of infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, but it is often underfunded and understaffed. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer better quality services, but they are mostly located in urban areas and are not affordable for the majority of the population. Access to healthcare is also a significant challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional healers and lack access to modern medical facilities.\n\nThe government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the implementation of a national health policy and the establishment of a health insurance scheme. However, the impact of these efforts has been limited, and the healthcare system remains under-resourced and inadequate. The **World Health Organization (WHO)** has been working with the government to strengthen the healthcare system, including providing technical assistance and supporting the development of healthcare infrastructure.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are some positive developments in the healthcare sector, including the increasing availability of **HIV/AIDS** treatment and the implementation of programs to control **malaria** and other infectious diseases. However, much more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country, including the shortage of healthcare professionals, the lack of access to healthcare services in rural areas, and the inadequate funding for the healthcare sector.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hopital General de Bangui | Bangui | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Centre Hospitalier de l'Amitie | Bangui | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Hopital de l'Universite | Bangui | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinique de la Paix | Bangui | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Hopital de Bouar | Bouar | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Clinique SOS Medica | Bangui | Private | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Expatriates and foreigners are recommended to have private health insurance that covers them globally, including in the Central African Republic.\n- Local insurance options are limited, and most insurance companies do not offer comprehensive coverage.\n- The government has established a health insurance scheme, but it is not mandatory, and coverage is limited.\n- Private health insurance can be expensive, but it is highly recommended for those who can afford it.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not common in the Central African Republic.\n- It is essential to carefully review the terms and conditions of any health insurance policy before purchasing it.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Pharmacies are limited in the Central African Republic, and many medications are not available.\n- Prescription requirements are often not enforced, and many medications can be purchased over the counter.\n- Common brands of medications may not be available, and generic versions may be the only option.\n- The cost of medications can be high, especially for imported brands.\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary medications with you when traveling to the Central African Republic, as they may not be available locally.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever** vaccination is required for all travelers to the Central African Republic.\n- **Hepatitis A** and **Hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers.\n- **Malaria** is a significant health risk in the Central African Republic, and prophylaxis is recommended.\n- **Typhoid** and **Rabies** vaccinations are also recommended.\n- The risk of **HIV/AIDS** and other **sexually transmitted infections** is high in the Central African Republic, and precautions should be taken.\n- The quality of **water** and **food** can be a concern, and travelers should take precautions to avoid waterborne and foodborne illnesses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Medical tourism is not a significant sector in the Central African Republic, and most medical procedures are not available.\n- Some private clinics may offer basic medical services, but these are not accredited to international standards.\n- Travelers are not recommended to seek medical care in the Central African Republic unless it is an emergency.\n- The cost of medical care can be high, especially in private clinics.\n- It is recommended to seek medical care in neighboring countries or in Europe if possible.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an emergency, call the emergency number 117 or go to the nearest hospital.\n- Ambulance services are limited, and it may be necessary to use a taxi or other transportation to get to a hospital.\n- The nearest hospital may not have the necessary equipment or staff to treat your condition, and evacuation to another country may be necessary.\n- It is essential to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including having a list of emergency contact numbers and knowing the location of the nearest hospital.\n- Insurance claims can be complicated, and it is recommended to have a comprehensive insurance policy that covers emergency medical evacuations.",
