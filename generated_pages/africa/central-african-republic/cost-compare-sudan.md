[SECTION] Overview: Central African Republic vs Sudan [/SECTION]
The Central African Republic and Sudan are two neighboring countries in Africa with distinct economic contexts. The Central African Republic has a smaller economy and faces challenges related to political instability and infrastructure development, which contributes to higher costs for certain goods and services. In contrast, Sudan has a larger and more diversified economy, with a stronger agricultural sector and more developed infrastructure, leading to relatively lower costs. As a result, Sudan is generally cheaper than the Central African Republic, with a difference in the overall cost of living of around 15-20%.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. The Central African Republic's economy is heavily reliant on foreign aid, which can lead to price volatility and higher costs for imported goods. On the other hand, Sudan's economy is more self-sufficient, with a stronger focus on domestic production and trade, resulting in lower prices for certain goods and services. Overall, Sudan's more developed economy and stronger infrastructure make it a more affordable option for expats, students, and families.
