[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Central African Republic has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering medical services. However, the overall quality of care is relatively low due to inadequate funding, lack of infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, but it is often underfunded and understaffed. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer better quality services, but they are mostly located in urban areas and are not affordable for the majority of the population. Access to healthcare is also a significant challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional healers and lack access to modern medical facilities.

The government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the implementation of a national health policy and the establishment of a health insurance scheme. However, the impact of these efforts has been limited, and the healthcare system remains under-resourced and inadequate. The **World Health Organization (WHO)** has been working with the government to strengthen the healthcare system, including providing technical assistance and supporting the development of healthcare infrastructure.

Despite these challenges, there are some positive developments in the healthcare sector, including the increasing availability of **HIV/AIDS** treatment and the implementation of programs to control **malaria** and other infectious diseases. However, much more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country, including the shortage of healthcare professionals, the lack of access to healthcare services in rural areas, and the inadequate funding for the healthcare sector.
