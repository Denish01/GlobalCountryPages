# Central African Republic Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Central African Republic is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in roads, power, water, and telecommunications, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 14% of population
Internet Penetration: 5%
Road Network: 20,000 km, poor
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 1
Major Ports: landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Central African Republic's infrastructure is one of the least developed in the world, with a **low level of access** to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country has faced significant challenges in recent years, including conflict, poverty, and lack of investment, which have hindered the development of its infrastructure. Despite these challenges, there have been some recent investments in the sector, including the rehabilitation of roads and the construction of new energy generation facilities. However, the **urban-rural gap** remains significant, with cities such as Bangui having better access to services than rural areas.

The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its **landlocked location**, which makes it reliant on neighboring countries for access to ports and international trade. The government has been working to improve the business environment and attract investment, but more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps. The **private sector** is also playing an increasingly important role in the development of the country's infrastructure, with several companies investing in the energy and telecommunications sectors.

Overall, the Central African Republic's infrastructure requires significant investment and development to support the country's economic growth and improve the living standards of its population. The government and international donors have been working together to develop a **National Infrastructure Plan**, which aims to address the country's infrastructure gaps and provide a framework for future development.
