        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The Central African Republic (CAR) was colonized by France in the late 19th century. The French established the colony of Ubangi-Shari in 1892, which was later merged with other French colonies to form the colony of French Equatorial Africa in 1910. The CAR gained independence from France on August 13, 1960, with David Dacko as its first president. The country's early years of independence were marked by instability and power struggles, with Dacko being overthrown in 1966 by Jean-Bedel Bokassa, who declared himself emperor in 1976. Bokassa was ousted in 1979, and the country has since experienced several coups and periods of instability.</p>
        <p>The CAR has a complex and tumultuous history, with various leaders and factions vying for power. The country has been classified as a <strong>presidential republic</strong>, with a president serving as head of state and government. The CAR has also been a member of the <strong>United Nations</strong> since 1960 and the <strong>African Union</strong> since 1963. The country's history has been marked by conflicts with neighboring countries, including Chad and Sudan, over border disputes and resources.</p>
        <p>The CAR has a diverse geography, with a mix of savannas, forests, and deserts. The country is landlocked, with no direct access to the sea, and has a total area of approximately 622,984 square kilometers. The capital city, <strong>Bangui</strong>, is located on the Ubangi River and has a population of around 750,000 people. The country has a total population of around 5.5 million people, with over 80 ethnic groups and more than 120 languages spoken.</p>
        <p>The CAR has a rich cultural heritage, with a mix of traditional and modern practices. The country has a strong tradition of music and dance, with the <strong>Sango</strong> language being an important part of the country's cultural identity. The CAR is also home to several <strong>UNESCO World Heritage sites</strong>, including the Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park and the Basse-Kotto Prefecture.</p>
