[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main entry point to Central African Republic is through Bangui M'Poko International Airport, which receives flights from major hubs in Africa and Europe. Direct flights are available from cities like Paris, Brussels, and Addis Ababa, while connections can be made through other African cities like Douala or Kinshasa. Overland entry points exist along the borders with neighboring countries, including Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, DR Congo, and Republic of Congo, but these routes can be challenging due to poor road conditions and security concerns.

For those entering by land, the most common border crossings are with Cameroon and Chad, as these borders are more frequently used by travelers and traders. However, it's essential to check the current security situation before attempting any overland journey, as conditions can change rapidly. Additionally, all travelers should ensure they have the necessary visas and documentation before attempting to enter Central African Republic, whether by air or land.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights within Central African Republic are limited, with most services operating out of Bangui to a handful of other towns and cities. The main domestic airline is **Air Centrafrique**, although its operations can be sporadic. Booking flights in advance is recommended, but be prepared for cancellations or changes in schedules. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and availability. It's also worth noting that some charter flights and humanitarian organizations may offer flights to more remote areas, but these are not typically available to the general public.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Central African Republic has no rail network, making train travel impossible within the country. The lack of railways limits the transportation of goods and people, contributing to the country's infrastructure challenges. As a result, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or domestic flights, to move around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus services in Central African Republic are available, although the quality and frequency of these services can vary greatly. Companies like **Société Centrafricaine de Transport** (SCAT) operate buses on the main routes, such as between Bangui and the towns of Bimbo, Mbaïki, and Bossangoa. Costs can range from $5 to $20 for a one-way ticket, depending on the distance and quality of the service. However, the condition of the buses and roads can make for uncomfortable journeys, and travelers should be prepared for delays and cancellations.
