  "content": "The Central African Republic is generally cheaper than South Sudan, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nCentral African Republic GDP per Capita (PPP): 694\nSouth Sudan GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,444\nCentral African Republic Inflation Rate: 4.2%\nSouth Sudan Inflation Rate: 37.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Central African Republic\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Central African Republic vs South Sudan [/SECTION]\nThe Central African Republic and South Sudan are two of the poorest countries in the world, with low GDP per capita and high inflation rates. Despite these challenges, both countries have a unique culture and history that attracts visitors and expats. In terms of cost of living, the Central African Republic is generally cheaper than South Sudan, with lower prices for rent, food, and transportation. However, the cost of living in both countries can vary greatly depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences.\n\nThe economic context of both countries is also an important factor to consider. The Central African Republic has a largely subsistence economy, with most people engaged in agriculture and small-scale trade. South Sudan, on the other hand, has a more diverse economy, with a growing oil industry and a larger service sector. However, both countries face significant development challenges, including poor infrastructure, corruption, and insecurity. As a result, the cost of living in both countries can be high, especially for expats and foreigners who require a higher standard of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Central African Republic (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 350 | 43% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Central African Republic (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Central African Republic (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Central African Republic (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Central African Republic (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 800 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Central African Republic is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 30-50% lower than in South Sudan\n- Food and dining, with prices that are 30-50% lower than in South Sudan\n- Transportation, with prices that are 30-50% lower than in South Sudan\n- Utilities and internet, with prices that are 30-50% lower than in South Sudan\n- **South Sudan is cheaper for:**\n- Some imported goods, which may be cheaper due to the country's larger port and trade infrastructure\n- Certain types of accommodation, such as luxury hotels and apartments, which may be more readily available in South Sudan\n- International flights, which may be more frequent and cheaper from South Sudan's capital, Juba\n- Certain types of food, such as meat and dairy products, which may be more widely available in South Sudan\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nThe Central African Republic and South Sudan are both challenging countries to live in, with high costs and limited infrastructure.
