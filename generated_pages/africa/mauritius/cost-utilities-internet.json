The quality of the infrastructure is generally good, with minimal power outages and a reliable water supply. However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The government has implemented measures to stabilize the costs of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and a tariff structure that incentivizes energy-efficient practices.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Mauritius is also influenced by the country's high standard of living and the resulting demand for energy and water. The government has implemented policies to promote renewable energy and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which is expected to lead to a decrease in the cost of electricity in the long term. However, in the short term, the costs of utilities are expected to remain stable, with minimal increases due to inflation and other external factors.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in rent) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-30 Mbps | Mauritius Telecom, Emtel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 60-100 Mbps | Mauritius Telecom, Emtel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Emtel, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Emtel, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Mauritius Telecom, Emtel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (My.T, a local streaming service) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Mauritius, it is recommended to contact the service providers directly and provide the necessary documentation, including a copy of your passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available for households that want to manage their energy consumption more effectively.\n- The best internet providers in Mauritius are Mauritius Telecom and Emtel, which offer a range of plans and bundles to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transportation or walk or cycle whenever possible.",
