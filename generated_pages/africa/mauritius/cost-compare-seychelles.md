[SECTION] Overview: Mauritius vs Seychelles [/SECTION]
Mauritius and Seychelles are two island nations located in the Indian Ocean, known for their stunning beaches, coral reefs, and unique cultural heritage. While both countries offer a high standard of living, they differ significantly in terms of cost. Mauritius has a more developed economy, with a strong manufacturing sector, tourism industry, and a growing financial sector. Seychelles, on the other hand, has a smaller economy, with a greater reliance on tourism and fishing. As a result, Seychelles tends to be more expensive, particularly when it comes to accommodation, food, and transportation.

The cost of living in Mauritius is generally lower due to its larger population, more developed infrastructure, and greater competition in the market. Additionally, Mauritius has a more diverse economy, which helps to keep prices in check. In contrast, Seychelles has a smaller population and a more limited range of goods and services, which can drive up prices. Overall, Mauritius offers a more affordable lifestyle, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.
