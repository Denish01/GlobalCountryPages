[SECTION] Overview: Mauritius vs Reunion [/SECTION]
Mauritius and Reunion are two island nations located in the Indian Ocean, with distinct economic contexts that impact their cost of living. Mauritius has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, textiles, and financial services, which contributes to its relatively lower cost of living. Reunion, on the other hand, is an overseas department of France, which means it has a more integrated economy with France and a higher cost of living due to its reliance on imports and a stronger currency. Overall, Mauritius is generally cheaper than Reunion, with a difference of around 15-20% in terms of cost of living.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Mauritius has a more competitive economy, with a lower tax regime and a more business-friendly environment, which attracts foreign investment and contributes to its lower cost of living. Reunion, on the other hand, has a more rigid economy, with a higher tax regime and a more regulated environment, which can drive up costs. Additionally, the cost of living in Reunion is also influenced by its proximity to France and the resulting high demand for imported goods and services.
