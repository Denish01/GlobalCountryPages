[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritius has a mixed healthcare system, comprising both public and private sectors. The public sector provides universal access to healthcare, with most services being free or low-cost for citizens. However, the quality of public healthcare can vary, and waiting times can be long. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers high-quality services, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in Mauritius, as they may not be eligible for free public healthcare. The healthcare system is generally well-equipped to handle common medical conditions, but for more complex or specialized care, patients may need to seek treatment abroad.

The healthcare system in Mauritius is well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the island. The public sector is managed by the Ministry of Health, while the private sector is made up of independent hospitals and clinics. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally sufficient, but for foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option due to the higher quality of care and shorter waiting times. It is worth noting that some private hospitals and clinics in Mauritius have international accreditation, making them a popular choice for medical tourism.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 114 or visit the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not be as widespread as in other countries. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including the embassy and insurance provider. The best hospitals for foreigners in Mauritius include the SSRN Hospital in Pamplemousses and the Fortis Clinique Darne in Floréal, which offer high-quality private healthcare services.

For emergency care, it is recommended to visit a private hospital, which can provide faster and more specialized treatment. However, this may come at a higher cost, and it is recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency medical care. In the event of a serious medical emergency, patients may need to be evacuated to a neighboring country or abroad for further treatment. It is worth noting that some private hospitals in Mauritius have international accreditation and may be recognized by foreign insurance providers, making it easier to claim reimbursement for medical expenses.
