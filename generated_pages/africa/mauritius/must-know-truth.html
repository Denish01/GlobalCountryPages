        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Mauritius, an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, has a rich and diverse history. The island was uninhabited until the arrival of the Portuguese in 1505, who named it "Ilha de Cirne". The Dutch established the first permanent settlement in 1638, and the island became a Dutch colony. In 1715, the French took control of the island and renamed it "Isle de France". The French established a prosperous economy based on sugar production, and the island became a strategic location for trade and commerce. The British captured the island in 1810, and it became a British colony. Mauritius gained independence on March 12, 1968, and became a sovereign nation.</p>
        <p>The country's history is a complex blend of African, European, and Asian influences. The <strong>transatlantic slave trade</strong> brought enslaved Africans to the island, who were forced to work on sugar plantations. Later, indentured servants from India were brought to the island to work on the plantations, and they played a significant role in shaping the island's culture and economy. The island's strategic location made it an important stopover for trade and commerce, and it was a key location for the <strong>British Empire</strong>.</p>
