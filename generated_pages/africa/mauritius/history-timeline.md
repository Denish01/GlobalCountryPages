# Mauritius History — Key Events & Timeline

Mauritius has a rich and diverse history dating back to its discovery by European explorers in the 16th century, with the island undergoing significant transformations under colonial rule, ultimately gaining independence in 1968.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Mauritius began with its discovery by European explorers in the 16th century, with the Portuguese being the first to visit the island in 1505. The island was uninhabited at the time, and it was not until the arrival of the Dutch in 1598 that the first attempts at colonization were made. The Dutch established a settlement on the island, which they named **Mauritius** after Prince Maurice of Nassau, but they abandoned it in 1710. The French then took control of the island in 1715, renaming it **Isle de France**, and established a more permanent settlement. The French period saw the development of the island's economy, with the introduction of **sugar cane** and the establishment of a **slave-based** economy. The British took control of the island in 1810, and it became a British colony, with the name being changed back to **Mauritius**.

During the British period, the island's economy continued to grow, with the establishment of a **plantation-based** economy. The British also introduced **indentured laborers** from India, who would eventually become a significant part of the island's population. The 20th century saw the rise of the **independence movement**, with the island's first political party, the **Labor Party**, being formed in 1936. The movement gained momentum in the 1950s and 1960s, with the island eventually gaining independence on March 12, 1968. Since independence, Mauritius has developed into a **stable democracy**, with a **diversified economy** and a **high standard of living**.

The island's history has been shaped by its strategic location in the **Indian Ocean**, with it being an important stopover for ships traveling between Europe and Asia. The island's **cultural diversity** is also a result of its history, with the population being made up of people of **African**, **European**, **Asian**, and **Creole** descent. The island's **language** and **cuisine** also reflect its cultural diversity, with **Creole**, **French**, and **English** being widely spoken, and **curries**, **stews**, and **seafood** being popular dishes.
