[SECTION] Overview: Mauritius vs Maldives [/SECTION]
Mauritius and Maldives are two island nations in the Indian Ocean, known for their beautiful beaches and vibrant cultures. However, they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Mauritius has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and financial services, which contributes to its relatively lower cost of living. In contrast, Maldives has a more limited economy, heavily reliant on tourism, which drives up prices for goods and services. As a result, Mauritius is generally cheaper than Maldives, with a cost of living that is approximately 30-40% lower.

The cost of living in Mauritius is also influenced by its proximity to Africa and its historical ties to Europe, which has led to a more Westernized lifestyle and a relatively high standard of living. In contrast, Maldives has a more isolated location and a distinct cultural identity, which can make it more expensive for foreigners to live and work there. Overall, Mauritius offers a more affordable and diverse lifestyle, while Maldives is more geared towards high-end tourism and luxury living.
