[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritius has a relatively liberal visa policy, with over 100 countries enjoying visa-free access to the island nation. Citizens of these countries can enter Mauritius without a visa and stay for a specified period, usually up to 90 days. The country's visa policy is designed to promote tourism and facilitate travel for business, education, and other purposes. Mauritius is a popular destination for travelers from around the world, and its visa policy reflects its commitment to being an open and welcoming country.

The visa policy of Mauritius is based on a system of reciprocity, with countries that offer visa-free access to Mauritian citizens also enjoying the same privilege. The country's immigration authorities have a list of eligible countries, and travelers from these countries can enter Mauritius without a visa. However, it's essential to note that visa-free access does not guarantee entry, and travelers must still meet certain requirements, such as holding a valid passport and proof of onward travel.
