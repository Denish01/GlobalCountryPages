[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritius has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving the quality of life for its citizens and supporting economic growth. The country has a well-developed road network, with many highways and roads connecting major towns and cities. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The government has launched several initiatives to address these disparities and improve the overall infrastructure of the country. Recent investments in the energy and telecommunications sectors have also helped to drive growth and development.

The country's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, making it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region. The government has invested heavily in the development of its ports and airports, which has helped to increase trade and tourism. However, the country still faces challenges in terms of its infrastructure, including a lack of investment in rural areas and a reliance on imported fuel for energy generation.

Mauritius has also made significant progress in terms of its environmental sustainability, with a focus on reducing its carbon footprint and promoting the use of renewable energy. The country has set ambitious targets to increase its use of renewable energy and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and has implemented several initiatives to promote energy efficiency and sustainability.
