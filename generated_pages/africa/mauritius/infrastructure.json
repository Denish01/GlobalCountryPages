  "content": "Mauritius has a well-developed infrastructure, with a strong focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications, supporting its growing economy and population of 1.3 million people.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 55%\nRoad Network: 2,066 km, good quality with well-maintained highways and roads\nRail Network: 60 km, limited to a few industrial areas\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMauritius has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving the quality of life for its citizens and supporting economic growth. The country has a well-developed road network, with many highways and roads connecting major towns and cities. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The government has launched several initiatives to address these disparities and improve the overall infrastructure of the country. Recent investments in the energy and telecommunications sectors have also helped to drive growth and development.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, making it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region. The government has invested heavily in the development of its ports and airports, which has helped to increase trade and tourism. However, the country still faces challenges in terms of its infrastructure, including a lack of investment in rural areas and a reliance on imported fuel for energy generation.\n\nMauritius has also made significant progress in terms of its environmental sustainability, with a focus on reducing its carbon footprint and promoting the use of renewable energy. The country has set ambitious targets to increase its use of renewable energy and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and has implemented several initiatives to promote energy efficiency and sustainability.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 2,066 km | Good | Well-maintained highways and roads connect major towns and cities |\n| Railways | 60 km | Limited | Mostly used for industrial purposes, with limited passenger services |\n| Airports | 2 international, 1 domestic | Good | Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport is the main airport, with flights to major destinations |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | Port Louis and Port Mathurin are the main ports, with facilities for cargo and cruise ships |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly important in Mauritius, with the government aiming to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix to 35% by 2025.\n- The country has a relatively reliable electricity supply, with **power outages** rare in urban areas, but more frequent in rural areas.\n- **Energy efficiency** is also a key focus area, with the government implementing measures to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of energy-efficient appliances.\n- Mauritius is also exploring the use of **biomass** and **geothermal energy** to reduce its reliance on imported fuels.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing its **energy independence**, with a number of renewable energy projects underway, including solar and wind farms.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but may not be safe in rural areas, where **waterborne diseases** can be a problem.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** is also relatively high, with over 95% of the population having access to improved water sources.\n- The government has implemented several initiatives to improve **water conservation** and reduce **water waste**, including the use of water-efficient appliances and fixtures.\n- **Wastewater treatment** is also a key focus area, with the government investing in the development of new wastewater treatment plants and the upgrade of existing facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is also widely available, with many households and businesses having access to high-speed internet services.\n- The government has launched several initiatives to promote the use of **information and communication technology (ICT)**, including the development of e-government services and the promotion of ICT education and training.\n- **4G and 5G networks** are also being rolled out, with several mobile operators offering high-speed mobile internet services.\n- **Postal services** are also available, with the Mauritius Post Office providing a range of services, including mail delivery and parcel services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a number of **infrastructure development projects**, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and ports, and the upgrade of existing facilities.\n- The **Mauritius Metro Express** project is a major infrastructure development project, which aims to provide a modern and efficient public transportation system for the country.\n- The government has also launched several initiatives to promote **sustainable development**, including the development of renewable energy projects and the promotion of energy efficiency.\n- **Foreign investment** is also playing a key role in the development of Mauritius' infrastructure, with several foreign companies investing in the country's energy, telecommunications, and transportation sectors.\n- The **African Development Bank** and other international organizations are also providing funding and technical assistance to support the development of Mauritius' infrastructure.",
