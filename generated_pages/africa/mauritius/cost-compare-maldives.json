However, they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Mauritius has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and financial services, which contributes to its relatively lower cost of living. In contrast, Maldives has a more limited economy, heavily reliant on tourism, which drives up prices for goods and services. As a result, Mauritius is generally cheaper than Maldives, with a cost of living that is approximately 30-40% lower.\n\nThe cost of living in Mauritius is also influenced by its proximity to Africa and its historical ties to Europe, which has led to a more Westernized lifestyle and a relatively high standard of living. In contrast, Maldives has a more isolated location and a distinct cultural identity, which can make it more expensive for foreigners to live and work there. Overall, Mauritius offers a more affordable and diverse lifestyle, while Maldives is more geared towards high-end tourism and luxury living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Maldives (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 800 | 100% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 500 | 100% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 1,500 | 87% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Maldives (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 20 | 100% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 500 | 67% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 6 | 100% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 2 | 4 | 100% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Maldives (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 50 | 150% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 100% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1.5 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Maldives (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 50% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 67% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 30 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mauritius (USD) | Maldives (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 2,000 | 40% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mauritius is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 50-100% lower than in Maldives\n- Food and dining, with meal prices that are 50-100% lower than in Maldives\n- Transportation, with taxi and fuel prices that are 25-50% lower than in Maldives\n- Utilities and internet, with prices that are 25-50% lower than in Maldives\n- **Maldives is cheaper for:**\n- High-end tourism and luxury living, with a wide range of upscale resorts and amenities\n- Water sports and activities, with a unique and diverse marine ecosystem\n- Exclusive and secluded getaways, with a range of private islands and resorts\n- Luxury shopping and dining, with a range of high-end boutiques and restaurants\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMauritius and Maldives offer distinct lifestyles and advantages, depending on your priorities and budget.
