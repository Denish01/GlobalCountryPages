[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Mauritius is easily accessible by air, with Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport (MRU) being the main entry point for international flights. The airport is located about 48 kilometers southeast of the capital city, Port Louis. Direct flights are available from major hubs such as Paris, London, and Dubai, as well as from neighboring islands like Madagascar and Reunion. Overland entry points are limited, as Mauritius is an island nation, but it is possible to arrive by sea on a cruise ship or private yacht.

For those traveling from nearby islands, there are also ferry services available, such as the one connecting Mauritius to Reunion. However, these services are not as frequent as flights and may not be as convenient. It's also worth noting that Mauritius has a well-developed tourism infrastructure, with many hotels and resorts offering airport transfer services, making it easy for visitors to get to their destination after arrival.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Mauritius has a limited domestic air network, with most flights operated by Air Mauritius, the national carrier. The main domestic routes connect the island's capital, Port Louis, to the smaller islands of Rodrigues and Agalega. These flights are relatively frequent, with multiple departures per day, and can be booked in advance through the Air Mauritius website or at the airport. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 USD per person, depending on the route and time of booking.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Mauritius does not have a rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a train system. As a result, visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around the island.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Mauritius has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect the island's main towns and cities. The main bus companies, such as National Transport Corporation (NTC) and Mauritius Bus Transport (MBT), operate frequent services throughout the day, with fares ranging from $1 to $5 USD per ride. The buses are generally comfortable and well-maintained, making them a convenient and affordable way to get around the island.

[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]

[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]
- Be aware of scams, such as overcharging by taxi drivers, and always agree on a fare before starting your journey.
