[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritius has a relatively small population, but it is densely packed, with an average of 609 people per square kilometer, making it one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. The population growth rate is relatively low, at 0.4% per annum, which is largely due to a declining fertility rate and an aging population. The urban population accounts for approximately 41.8% of the total population, with the majority of people living in urban areas such as Port Louis, the capital city. The population of Mauritius is also characterized by a high level of migration, with many people moving to the island for work or education, particularly from neighboring countries such as Madagascar and Reunion.

The population of Mauritius has been growing steadily over the years, but at a slow pace, due to a combination of factors, including a low fertility rate and a high life expectancy. The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with many people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities and living standards. This trend is expected to continue, with the urban population projected to increase in the coming years.

The government of Mauritius has been implementing policies to manage population growth and urbanization, including measures to promote family planning and reproductive health, as well as initiatives to improve housing and infrastructure in urban areas. However, the country still faces challenges related to population growth, including pressure on public services and infrastructure, as well as environmental concerns related to urbanization and development.
