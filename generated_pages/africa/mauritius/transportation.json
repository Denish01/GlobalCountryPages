  "content": "To get around in Mauritius, you can use a combination of taxis, buses, and rental cars, as well as domestic flights to reach the island's various regions and neighboring islands.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport (MRU)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: Bolt, local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nMauritius is easily accessible by air, with Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport (MRU) being the main entry point for international flights. The airport is located about 48 kilometers southeast of the capital city, Port Louis. Direct flights are available from major hubs such as Paris, London, and Dubai, as well as from neighboring islands like Madagascar and Reunion. Overland entry points are limited, as Mauritius is an island nation, but it is possible to arrive by sea on a cruise ship or private yacht.\n\nFor those traveling from nearby islands, there are also ferry services available, such as the one connecting Mauritius to Reunion. However, these services are not as frequent as flights and may not be as convenient. It's also worth noting that Mauritius has a well-developed tourism infrastructure, with many hotels and resorts offering airport transfer services, making it easy for visitors to get to their destination after arrival.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nMauritius has a limited domestic air network, with most flights operated by Air Mauritius, the national carrier. The main domestic routes connect the island's capital, Port Louis, to the smaller islands of Rodrigues and Agalega. These flights are relatively frequent, with multiple departures per day, and can be booked in advance through the Air Mauritius website or at the airport. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 USD per person, depending on the route and time of booking.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nMauritius does not have a rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a train system. As a result, visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around the island.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nMauritius has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect the island's main towns and cities. The main bus companies, such as National Transport Corporation (NTC) and Mauritius Bus Transport (MBT), operate frequent services throughout the day, with fares ranging from $1 to $5 USD per ride. The buses are generally comfortable and well-maintained, making them a convenient and affordable way to get around the island.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Port Louis, other major towns | $1-$2 | Frequent services, affordable fares |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $10-$20/km | Metered fares, available at airports and towns |\n| Ride-Hailing | Port Louis, other major towns | $5-$10 | Bolt and local alternatives available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Limited availability | $5-$10 | Not as common as taxis or buses |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Mauritius, visitors will need to obtain a temporary driving permit, which can be issued at the airport or at a local police station.\n- The road conditions in Mauritius are generally good, with well-maintained highways and scenic coastal roads.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, with gasoline prices averaging around $1.50 USD per liter.\n- Car rental companies, such as Europcar and Hertz, are available at the airport and in major towns, with prices starting from around $40 USD per day.\n- Drivers should be aware of the local traffic laws, including the requirement to drive on the left-hand side of the road.\n- Hazards such as potholes, pedestrians, and cyclists are common, so drivers should exercise caution when navigating the island's roads.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of scams, such as overcharging by taxi drivers, and always agree on a fare before starting your journey.\n- Payment methods, such as credit cards and cash, are widely accepted, but it's a good idea to have some local currency, Mauritian Rupees (MUR), for small purchases.\n- Download the Bolt ride-hailing app to book taxis and cars in advance.\n- Always wear a seatbelt when driving or riding in a vehicle, as traffic laws are strictly enforced.\n- Be mindful of the island's unique wildlife, such as giant tortoises and monkeys, which may be encountered on the roads.\n- Consider purchasing a local SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hotspot to stay connected and navigate the island.\n- Respect local customs and traditions, such as not drinking and driving, and not littering or polluting the environment.\n- Stay informed about local events and festivals, which may affect traffic and transportation services.",
