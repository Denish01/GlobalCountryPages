The districts are further divided into villages and towns, with each district having its own distinct character and identity. The 9 districts of Mauritius are Black River, Flacq, Grand Port, Moka, Pamplemousses, Plaines Wilhems, Port Louis, Rivière du Rempart, and Savanne. The 3 dependencies, Rodrigues, Agaléga, and Saint Brandon, are located outside of the main island and have their own unique cultural and geographical characteristics.\n\nThe administrative divisions of Mauritius are designed to provide effective governance and management of the island's resources. Each district has its own local government, which is responsible for providing services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development to the local population. The districts also have their own economic and cultural activities, with some districts specializing in tourism, agriculture, or manufacturing. Overall, the administrative structure of Mauritius is designed to promote economic development, social welfare, and environmental sustainability.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Port Louis** (155,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, port city\nKnown For: its rich history, cultural diversity, and vibrant marketplaces\nBest For: business travelers, history buffs, and shoppers\n\n**Beau Bassin-Rose Hill** (103,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its vibrant nightlife, shopping centers, and cultural events\nBest For: young travelers, partygoers, and families\n\n**Vacoas-Phoenix** (100,000)\nRole: economic hub, residential area\nKnown For: its modern infrastructure, shopping centers, and recreational facilities\nBest For: families, expats, and business travelers\n\n**Curepipe** (80,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, cultural events, and natural scenery\nBest For: history buffs, nature lovers, and families\n\n**Quatre Bornes** (75,000)\nRole: economic hub, residential area\nKnown For: its vibrant marketplaces, shopping centers, and recreational facilities\nBest For: shoppers, families, and business travelers\n\n**Saint Pierre** (40,000)\nRole: residential area, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, cultural events, and natural scenery\nBest For: history buffs, nature lovers, and families\n\n**Bel Air Rivière Sèche** (30,000)\nRole: residential area, cultural center\nKnown For: its vibrant cultural events, historic landmarks, and natural scenery\nBest For: history buffs, nature lovers, and families\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Black River | Coastal, mountainous | Natural scenery, outdoor activities | Tamarin |\n| Flacq | Coastal, agricultural | Beaches, water sports, farming | Centre de Flacq |\n| Grand Port | Coastal, historical | Historic landmarks, cultural events | Mahébourg |\n| Moka | Mountainous, residential | Natural scenery, hiking trails | Moka |\n| Pamplemousses | Coastal, agricultural | Botanical gardens, farming | Pamplemousses |\n| Plaines Wilhems | Urban, economic | Shopping centers, recreational facilities | Beau Bassin-Rose Hill |\n| Port Louis | Urban, economic | Historic landmarks, cultural events | Port Louis |\n| Rivière du Rempart | Coastal, agricultural | Beaches, water sports, farming | Mapou |\n| Savanne | Mountainous, agricultural | Natural scenery, hiking trails, farming | Souillac |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The coastal regions of Mauritius, such as Black River and Flacq, are known for their beautiful beaches, water sports, and outdoor activities.\n- The mountainous regions, such as Moka and Savanne, are known for their natural scenery, hiking trails, and agricultural activities.\n- The urban regions, such as Port Louis and Plaines Wilhems, are known for their economic activities, cultural events, and recreational facilities.\n- The cultural and linguistic differences between regions are also notable, with some regions having a stronger Creole or French influence, while others have a more diverse cultural identity.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nMauritius has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, buses, and taxis available.

Domestic flights are available to Rodrigues Island, which is located about 600 kilometers east of Mauritius. The bus network is extensive, with buses connecting all major towns and villages. Taxis are also widely available, and car rental services are available for those who prefer to drive.
