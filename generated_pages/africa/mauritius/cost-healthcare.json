The public sector provides universal access to healthcare, with most services being free or low-cost for citizens. However, the quality of public healthcare can vary, and waiting times can be long. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers high-quality services, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in Mauritius, as they may not be eligible for free public healthcare. The healthcare system is generally well-equipped to handle common medical conditions, but for more complex or specialized care, patients may need to seek treatment abroad.\n\nThe healthcare system in Mauritius is well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the island. The public sector is managed by the Ministry of Health, while the private sector is made up of independent hospitals and clinics. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally sufficient, but for foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option due to the higher quality of care and shorter waiting times. It is worth noting that some private hospitals and clinics in Mauritius have international accreditation, making them a popular choice for medical tourism.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public sector prices are subsidized, while private sector prices vary by clinic |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$250 | Specialist consultations in public sector may require a referral |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $50-$150 | Private dental clinics offer a wider range of services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private eye clinics may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public sector emergency rooms are free, but may have long waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations and shorter waiting times |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Prices vary depending on the type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Private hospitals offer more luxurious maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private hospitals and clinics may have more advanced imaging equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | X-rays are widely available in both public and private sector |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers public sector healthcare, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers private sector healthcare, including specialist consultations and hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers healthcare abroad, including emergency medical evacuations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as painkillers and antibiotics are widely available at pharmacies and relatively affordable, with prices starting from $5-$10.\n- Prescription medications may require a doctor's prescription, which can cost $10-$20.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less accessible in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may require a consultation with a pharmacist.\n- Some medications may be subsidized by the government, making them more affordable for locals.\n- It is recommended to check the prices and availability of medications before traveling to Mauritius.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 114 or visit the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not be as widespread as in other countries. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including the embassy and insurance provider. The best hospitals for foreigners in Mauritius include the SSRN Hospital in Pamplemousses and the Fortis Clinique Darne in Floréal, which offer high-quality private healthcare services.\n\nFor emergency care, it is recommended to visit a private hospital, which can provide faster and more specialized treatment. However, this may come at a higher cost, and it is recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency medical care.
