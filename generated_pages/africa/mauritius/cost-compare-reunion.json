Mauritius has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, textiles, and financial services, which contributes to its relatively lower cost of living. Reunion, on the other hand, is an overseas department of France, which means it has a more integrated economy with France and a higher cost of living due to its reliance on imports and a stronger currency. Overall, Mauritius is generally cheaper than Reunion, with a difference of around 15-20% in terms of cost of living.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Mauritius has a more competitive economy, with a lower tax regime and a more business-friendly environment, which attracts foreign investment and contributes to its lower cost of living. Reunion, on the other hand, has a more rigid economy, with a higher tax regime and a more regulated environment, which can drive up costs. Additionally, the cost of living in Reunion is also influenced by its proximity to France and the resulting high demand for imported goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Reunion (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 550 | 27% more expensive in Reunion |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 350 | 29% more expensive in Reunion |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 700 | 1,000 | 30% more expensive in Reunion |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Reunion (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 20 | 25% more expensive in Reunion |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 400 | 25% more expensive in Reunion |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 4 | 25% more expensive in Reunion |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Reunion |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Reunion (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Reunion |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 1.5 | 33% more expensive in Reunion |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1.5 | 20% more expensive in Reunion |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Reunion (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 33% more expensive in Reunion |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive in Reunion |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Reunion |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mauritius (USD) | Reunion (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1,200 | 33% cheaper in Mauritius |\n| Mid-Range | 1,500 | 2,200 | 31% cheaper in Mauritius |\n| Comfortable | 2,500 | 3,500 | 29% cheaper in Mauritius |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mauritius is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices 25-30% lower than in Reunion\n- Food and dining, with meal prices 20-30% lower than in Reunion\n- Transportation, with fuel prices 15-20% lower than in Reunion\n- Utilities and internet, with prices 20-30% lower than in Reunion\n- **Reunion is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, such as electronics and clothing, which can be 10-20% cheaper than in Mauritius\n- Healthcare, with a more comprehensive and subsidized healthcare system\n- Education, with access to French universities and a more developed education system\n- Travel, with more frequent and affordable flights to France and other European destinations\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMauritius offers better value for expats, students, and families who are looking for a more affordable cost of living without sacrificing quality of life.
