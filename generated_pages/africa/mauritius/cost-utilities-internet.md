[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritius has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a high percentage of the population having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. The quality of the infrastructure is generally good, with minimal power outages and a reliable water supply. However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The government has implemented measures to stabilize the costs of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and a tariff structure that incentivizes energy-efficient practices.

The cost of utilities in Mauritius is also influenced by the country's high standard of living and the resulting demand for energy and water. The government has implemented policies to promote renewable energy and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which is expected to lead to a decrease in the cost of electricity in the long term. However, in the short term, the costs of utilities are expected to remain stable, with minimal increases due to inflation and other external factors.
