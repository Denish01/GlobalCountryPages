While both countries offer a high standard of living, they differ significantly in terms of cost. Mauritius has a more developed economy, with a strong manufacturing sector, tourism industry, and a growing financial sector. Seychelles, on the other hand, has a smaller economy, with a greater reliance on tourism and fishing. As a result, Seychelles tends to be more expensive, particularly when it comes to accommodation, food, and transportation.\n\nThe cost of living in Mauritius is generally lower due to its larger population, more developed infrastructure, and greater competition in the market. Additionally, Mauritius has a more diverse economy, which helps to keep prices in check. In contrast, Seychelles has a smaller population and a more limited range of goods and services, which can drive up prices. Overall, Mauritius offers a more affordable lifestyle, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Seychelles (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 400 | 38% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 1,200 | 33% more expensive in Seychelles |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Seychelles (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 25 | 40% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 400 | 25% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 5 | 40% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Seychelles |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Seychelles (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.50 | 20% more expensive in Seychelles |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mauritius (USD) | Seychelles (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 33% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive in Seychelles |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Seychelles |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mauritius (USD) | Seychelles (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1,200 | 33% savings in Mauritius |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% savings in Mauritius |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% savings in Mauritius |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mauritius is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and accommodation\n  - Food and dining\n  - Transportation\n  - Utilities and internet\n- **Seychelles is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain luxury goods and imported items\n  - High-end tourism activities\n  - Private education\n  - Healthcare services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMauritius offers a more affordable lifestyle, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.
