[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Mauritius has a relatively well-developed public transportation system, with buses being the primary mode of transportation for locals and tourists alike. The quality of public transit is generally good, with buses running frequently and covering most areas of the island. However, the system can be crowded during peak hours, and traffic congestion is a common issue, especially in urban areas like Port Louis. Most people in Mauritius get around using public buses or taxis, with some opting for car rentals or ride-hailing services for more convenience.

The island's geography, with its mountainous interior and coastal roads, can make transportation challenging, especially during heavy rainfall or strong winds. However, the government has invested in improving the road network, making it easier to get around the island. Additionally, many tourists opt for car rentals or guided tours to explore the island's scenic routes and attractions. With a **GDP per capita PPP** of $31,840, Mauritius has a relatively high standard of living, and transportation costs are generally affordable for both locals and visitors.
