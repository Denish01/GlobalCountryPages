When shopping at local markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for fresh produce. Vendors often expect customers to negotiate, and you can usually get a better price by offering a lower amount. However, be respectful and fair in your negotiations, and don't try to lowball the vendor. It's also a good idea to **buy in bulk** and **shop during the off-season** to get the best prices.
