[SECTION] How Mauritius Is Divided [/SECTION]
Mauritius is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, and its administrative structure is divided into 9 districts and 3 dependencies.

The 9 districts of Mauritius are Black River, Flacq, Grand Port, Moka, Pamplemousses, Plaines Wilhems, Port Louis, Rivière du Rempart, and Savanne. The 3 dependencies, Rodrigues, Agaléga, and Saint Brandon, are located outside of the main island and have their own unique cultural and geographical characteristics.

The administrative divisions of Mauritius are designed to provide effective governance and management of the island's resources. Each district has its own local government, which is responsible for providing services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development to the local population. The districts also have their own economic and cultural activities, with some districts specializing in tourism, agriculture, or manufacturing.
