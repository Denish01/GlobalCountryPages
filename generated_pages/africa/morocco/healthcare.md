[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Morocco's healthcare system is structured into three main components: public, private, and mutual aid societies. The public sector provides healthcare services to the majority of the population, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers across the country. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality healthcare services, but at a higher cost, making it inaccessible to many Moroccans. The quality of care in Morocco varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with cities like Rabat and Casablanca having better-equipped hospitals and more specialized healthcare professionals. In contrast, rural areas often struggle with limited access to healthcare services, inadequate facilities, and a shortage of medical staff.

The Moroccan government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, which provides coverage to citizens and residents. However, the scheme has its limitations, and many people, especially in rural areas, remain without adequate healthcare coverage. Despite these challenges, Morocco has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in healthcare infrastructure, medical equipment, and the training of healthcare professionals.

The healthcare system in Morocco also faces challenges related to the **brain drain** of medical professionals, who often emigrate to other countries in search of better job opportunities and higher salaries. This has resulted in a shortage of specialized healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. To address this issue, the government has introduced initiatives to attract and retain medical professionals, including offering incentives and improving working conditions.
