Public schools are generally free or low-cost, but the quality of education can vary depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction in Moroccan schools is Arabic, with French being taught as a second language. Compulsory education in Morocco lasts for 9 years, from age 6 to 15. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Casablanca and Rabat, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.\n\nThe quality of education in Morocco has been improving in recent years, with the government investing in education infrastructure and teacher training. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas where access to education can be limited. Private schools and international schools offer a higher quality of education, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Moroccans. For expats and international students, there are a range of options available, including international schools and private universities.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on location |\n| Private Primary | $200-$1,000 | Range of quality and prices depending on tier |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on location |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,500 | Range of quality and prices depending on tier |\n| International School | $2,000-$10,000 | IB, British, and American curricula available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited spots available for international students |\n| Private University | $1,000-$5,000 | $2,000-$10,000 | Range of quality and prices depending on institution |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$10,000 | $5,000-$20,000 | Al Akhawayn University, a top-ranked private university |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited availability outside of major cities |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Range of quality and prices depending on tutor |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | Arabic, French, and English courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, such as notebooks and pens |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most public and private schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats and international students are generally private and international schools, which offer a higher quality of education and a range of curricula.\n- Scholarships are available for Moroccan students, particularly for those from low-income backgrounds, but options are limited for international students.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly available, particularly for university-level courses.\n- Education quality in Morocco is generally lower than in other countries in the region, such as Tunisia and Egypt, but is improving.\n- It is recommended to research schools thoroughly and visit in person before making a decision, as quality can vary significantly depending on the institution.\n- Learning Arabic or French can be beneficial for students, particularly those planning to stay in Morocco long-term, as it can improve job prospects and cultural integration.",
