  "content": "[FACTBOX]\nLand Area: 710,850 km2, about the size of Texas\nHighest Point: Jbel Toubkal, 4,167 meters\nLowest Point: Sebkha Tah, -55 meters\nCoastline: 1,835 km\nBorders: Algeria, Western Sahara, Spain\nClimate Type: arid, semi-arid, and temperate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]\nMorocco is located in the northwest corner of Africa, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Sahara Desert to the south and east. The country shares borders with Algeria to the east and southeast, Western Sahara to the south, and Spain to the north via the Strait of Gibraltar and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. Morocco's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nMorocco's coastline stretches for over 1,800 kilometers, offering a diverse range of coastal landscapes, from the rugged cliffs of the northern Mediterranean coast to the sandy beaches of the Atlantic coast. The country's border with Western Sahara is disputed, with Morocco claiming sovereignty over the territory. The border with Algeria is also a subject of tension, with ongoing disagreements over trade and security issues. Despite these challenges, Morocco has maintained good relations with its European neighbors, particularly Spain, with which it shares strong economic and cultural ties.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nMorocco's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, deserts, forests, and coastlines. The Atlas Mountains, which stretch across the center of the country, are home to Morocco's highest peak, Jbel Toubkal, and offer a range of hiking and trekking opportunities. The mountains are also home to several traditional Berber villages, where visitors can experience the country's rich cultural heritage. The coastal plains, which stretch along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, are fertile and densely populated, with many of Morocco's major cities, including Casablanca and Rabat, located in these areas.\n\nIn addition to its mountains and coastal plains, Morocco is also home to several deserts, including the Sahara Desert, which covers much of the country's eastern and southern regions. The desert landscape is characterized by vast expanses of sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and oases, where visitors can experience the harsh but beautiful conditions of the desert environment. Morocco's forests, which cover around 10% of the country's land area, are also an important feature of the landscape, providing habitat for a range of wildlife, including Barbary macaques, Atlas deer, and golden eagles.\n\nThe country's rivers, including the Moulouya, Sebou, and Bou Regreg, play an important role in shaping the landscape and supporting agriculture and industry. The rivers are often lined with fertile valleys and plains, which are home to many of Morocco's most important agricultural regions. The country's coastline is also an important feature of the landscape, with many beautiful beaches, bays, and ports, including the historic port city of Tangier.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter | December to February | 10-18°C | moderate | cool and wet |\n| Spring | March to May | 15-25°C | low | mild and sunny |\n| Summer | June to August | 25-35°C | very low | hot and dry |\n| Autumn | September to November | 15-25°C | low | warm and sunny |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: March to May and September to November.
