The country's urbanization trend is also notable, with over 60% of the population residing in urban areas, such as **Rabat**, **Casablanca**, and **Marrakech**. Migration patterns in Morocco are characterized by a mix of internal and international movements, with many Moroccans seeking better economic opportunities in Europe and other parts of the world. The country's population is projected to continue growing, with estimates suggesting that it will reach around 44 million by 2030.\n\nThe population of Morocco is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 29.5 years. This demographic profile presents both opportunities and challenges for the country, as it will need to create jobs and provide services for its growing population. In terms of population density, Morocco has an average of 84 people per square kilometer, with the majority of the population concentrated in the coastal regions and urban areas.\n\nMorocco's population growth rate has been steadily declining over the past few decades, from around 2.5% in the 1980s to the current rate of 1.2%. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including improved access to education and family planning services, as well as changes in social norms and cultural values. Despite this decline, Morocco's population is still growing, and the country will need to continue to invest in its healthcare, education, and infrastructure systems to support its growing population.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arab | 70% | Throughout the country | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Berber | 20% | Mountains and rural areas | Indigenous ethnic group |\n| Arab-Berber | 5% | Urban areas | Mixed ancestry |\n| Sahrawi | 2% | Southern regions | Refugee population from Western Sahara |\n| French and Spanish | 1% | Coastal cities | Descendants of colonial settlers |\n| Other | 2% | Urban areas | Sub-Saharan Africans, Asians, and other international communities |\n\nMorocco's ethnic diversity is a significant aspect of its cultural identity, with a mix of Arab, Berber, and other ethnic groups.
