[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Morocco is generally a safe country to visit, with low rates of violent crime. However, as with any popular tourist destination, petty crimes such as pickpocketing and scams can occur. Visitors should be aware of their surroundings, especially in crowded areas and tourist hotspots. The country has a strong police presence, and tourist police are available to assist visitors. Morocco has also taken steps to improve security in recent years, including increasing security measures at airports and tourist areas.

Despite these efforts, there are some areas of concern. Protests and demonstrations can occur, especially in larger cities like Rabat and Casablanca. Visitors should avoid areas where protests are taking place and follow local advice. Additionally, there are some areas of the country that are considered off-limits to tourists, such as the Western Sahara region. Visitors should exercise caution when traveling to these areas and follow local guidance.
