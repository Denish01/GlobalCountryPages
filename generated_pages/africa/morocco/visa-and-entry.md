# Morocco Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Morocco before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Morocco has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of around 70 countries to enter visa-free. The country's visa stance is relatively liberal, with a focus on promoting tourism and economic development. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free agreement with Morocco can typically obtain a visa on arrival or through an eVisa system. Morocco's visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to attract visitors and investors.

The Moroccan government has implemented various measures to simplify the visa application process, including the introduction of an eVisa system for citizens of certain countries. This system allows applicants to submit their visa applications online and receive a decision within a short period. Additionally, Morocco has established visa-free agreements with several countries, including many European and African nations. Citizens of these countries can enter Morocco without a visa and stay for a specified period, typically up to 90 days.
