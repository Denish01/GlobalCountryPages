[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Morocco's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, but it is more affordable for locals. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option due to the higher standard of care and availability of English-speaking staff. While health insurance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended for both locals and foreigners to cover unexpected medical expenses. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals often relying on public facilities for routine care, while foreigners tend to opt for private clinics and hospitals.

The quality of healthcare in Morocco varies significantly depending on the location and type of facility. Major cities like Rabat, Casablanca, and Marrakech have a higher concentration of high-quality private hospitals and clinics, while rural areas often rely on public facilities with more limited resources. For foreigners, it is essential to research and choose a reputable private hospital or clinic, especially in emergency situations. Many private facilities have international accreditation and offer a range of specialized services, including cardiology, oncology, and orthopedics.
