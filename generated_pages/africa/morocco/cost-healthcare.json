  "content": "In Morocco, the cost of healthcare varies significantly between public and private facilities, with the average health expenditure per capita being around $232, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 37.2% of total health spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $232\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 37.2%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 15\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: MAD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMorocco's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, but it is more affordable for locals. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option due to the higher standard of care and availability of English-speaking staff. While health insurance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended for both locals and foreigners to cover unexpected medical expenses. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals often relying on public facilities for routine care, while foreigners tend to opt for private clinics and hospitals.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Morocco varies significantly depending on the location and type of facility. Major cities like Rabat, Casablanca, and Marrakech have a higher concentration of high-quality private hospitals and clinics, while rural areas often rely on public facilities with more limited resources. For foreigners, it is essential to research and choose a reputable private hospital or clinic, especially in emergency situations. Many private facilities have international accreditation and offer a range of specialized services, including cardiology, oncology, and orthopedics.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics often have long wait times, while private clinics offer more personalized care |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private specialists often have more advanced equipment and training |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics offer a wider range of services, including cosmetic dentistry |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private optometrists often have more advanced equipment for eye exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-$10 | $20-$30 | Private labs often offer faster turnaround times for test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals often have long wait times, while private hospitals offer more prompt care |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals often have more comfortable rooms and amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Private hospitals often have more advanced equipment and specialized surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospitals often offer more personalized care and amenities for new mothers |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics often have more advanced imaging equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Private clinics often offer faster turnaround times for test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers a wide range of medical expenses, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical expenses worldwide, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medication**: Prices vary depending on the type and brand, but expect to pay $5-$20 for a standard prescription\n- **Over-the-counter medication**: Prices are generally lower, ranging from $2-$10 for common medications like pain relievers and antihistamines\n- **Pharmacy availability**: Pharmacies are widely available in major cities, but may be more limited in rural areas\n- **Prescription rules**: Prescription medication can only be obtained with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor\n- **Common medication prices**: Antibiotics ($10-$20), pain relievers ($5-$10), antihistamines ($5-$10)\n- **Vaccinations**: Recommended vaccinations for travel to Morocco include hepatitis A, typhoid, and rabies, with prices ranging from $50-$100 per vaccination\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 15, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.
