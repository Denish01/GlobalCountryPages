[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Morocco is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools are generally free or low-cost, but the quality of education can vary depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction in Moroccan schools is Arabic, with French being taught as a second language. Compulsory education in Morocco lasts for 9 years, from age 6 to 15. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Casablanca and Rabat, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.

The quality of education in Morocco has been improving in recent years, with the government investing in education infrastructure and teacher training. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas where access to education can be limited. Private schools and international schools offer a higher quality of education, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Moroccans. For expats and international students, there are a range of options available, including international schools and private universities.
