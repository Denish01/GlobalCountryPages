Morocco's lower cost of living is largely due to its lower housing costs, with rent prices in cities like Marrakech and Fez being significantly lower than in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. Additionally, Morocco's diverse economy, which includes a strong agricultural sector, helps to keep food prices relatively low.
