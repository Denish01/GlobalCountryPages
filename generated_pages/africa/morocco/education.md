[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Morocco is divided into three main stages: **primary education**, which lasts for six years, **secondary education**, which lasts for three years, and **tertiary education**, which includes universities and other higher education institutions. The system is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, managing schools, and overseeing teacher training. While the public education system is free and widely available, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the region and the type of school. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Moroccans.

The education system in Morocco faces several challenges, including a high **dropout rate**, particularly among girls and in rural areas, as well as a lack of **resources** and **infrastructure** in many schools. However, the government has implemented several reforms in recent years aimed at improving the quality of education, including the introduction of new curriculum standards and the expansion of vocational training programs. Despite these challenges, Morocco has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and women, and the country has a relatively high **literacy rate** compared to other countries in the region.

Morocco's education system is also characterized by a strong emphasis on **Islamic studies** and **Arabic language**, which are compulsory subjects in all schools. However, the system also offers a range of other subjects, including **mathematics**, **science**, and **foreign languages**, such as **French** and **English**. The country has also introduced several initiatives aimed at promoting **critical thinking** and **problem-solving skills**, as well as **entrepreneurship** and **innovation**.
