[SECTION] How Morocco Is Divided [/SECTION]
Morocco is divided into 12 regions, each with its own governor and regional council. These regions are further divided into provinces and prefectures, which are then divided into municipalities and rural communes. The 12 regions of Morocco are: Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, Oriental, Fes-Meknes, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Marrakech-Safi, Drâa-Tafilalet, Souss-Massa, Guelmim-Oued Noun, Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra, Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, and Casablanca-Settat. This administrative structure allows for a balance of power between the central government and regional authorities.

The division of Morocco into regions has helped to promote economic development and improve the delivery of public services. Each region has its own unique character and strengths, and the regional councils play an important role in promoting local economic development and preserving cultural heritage. The regional structure also allows for a more efficient delivery of public services, such as healthcare and education, and has helped to reduce poverty and inequality in Morocco.
