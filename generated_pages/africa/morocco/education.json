However, the government has implemented several reforms in recent years aimed at improving the quality of education, including the introduction of new curriculum standards and the expansion of vocational training programs. Despite these challenges, Morocco has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and women, and the country has a relatively high **literacy rate** compared to other countries in the region.\n\nMorocco's education system is also characterized by a strong emphasis on **Islamic studies** and **Arabic language**, which are compulsory subjects in all schools.
