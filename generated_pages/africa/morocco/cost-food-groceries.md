[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Morocco. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce at lower prices, but the quality and variety may vary. It's recommended to buy fresh fruits and vegetables from local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported products. Bargaining is a common practice in local markets, and visitors can expect to haggle over prices, especially when buying in bulk.

When shopping at local markets, it's essential to know the local prices and to be prepared to negotiate. Vendors may start with a higher price, but visitors can often get a better deal by offering a lower price and being willing to walk away. Supermarkets, on the other hand, offer fixed prices, and visitors can expect to pay the listed price. Overall, a combination of both supermarket and local market shopping can provide the best value and variety for visitors.
