[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Morocco is generally of good quality, with an average speed of 10 Mbps download, making it suitable for most online activities such as browsing, streaming, and social media. However, there is a noticeable urban vs rural divide, with faster and more reliable connections available in cities like Rabat, Casablanca, and Marrakech, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall reliability of the internet in Morocco is relatively high, with most users experiencing few issues with their connections.

The Moroccan government has been investing heavily in improving the country's internet infrastructure, with a focus on expanding fiber-optic networks and increasing mobile coverage. This has led to a significant improvement in internet speeds and availability, especially in urban areas. However, more needs to be done to address the rural-urban divide and ensure that all citizens have access to fast and reliable internet.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Morocco is relatively easy, with several options available for tourists and travelers. The main carriers, Orange, Maroc Telecom, and Inwi, all offer a range of plans and packages, including tourist-friendly options with data, voice, and text. To purchase a SIM card, you will typically need to provide a passport and proof of address, and the cost will be around 10 USD for a tourist SIM. You can buy SIM cards at airports, carrier stores, or from street vendors.

The best carriers for tourists are Orange and Maroc Telecom, which offer a range of plans and packages, including data-only options. Inwi is also a good option, with competitive pricing and good coverage. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card as soon as you arrive in Morocco, as this will give you access to data and voice services, and make it easier to navigate the country.
