[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Morocco has a diverse climate, ranging from the Mediterranean in the north to the desert in the south, and the Atlantic coast in the west. The country can be divided into four main climate zones: the coastal region, the Atlas Mountains, the desert, and the eastern region. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by hot and dry weather, while the wet season, from November to April, brings mild and wet conditions. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the desert and the wet season being ideal for hiking and trekking in the mountains.

The spring season, from March to May, is a great time to visit Morocco, with mild temperatures and fewer crowds, making it perfect for exploring the cities, such as **Marrakech** and **Fez**, and enjoying the beautiful landscapes. The fall season, from September to November, is also an excellent time to visit, with comfortable temperatures and a vibrant atmosphere, making it ideal for attending festivals and events. The summer months, from June to August, are peak season, with hot and dry weather, and large crowds, making it challenging to explore the cities and attractions.

The winter months, from December to February, are the low season, with cold and wet weather, and fewer tourists, making it a great time to visit for those on a budget. However, some attractions and tourist facilities may be closed or operate on reduced hours, and the weather can be unpredictable. Overall, the best time to visit Morocco depends on the region and the type of activities you plan to do, but the spring and fall seasons are generally the most pleasant and enjoyable.
