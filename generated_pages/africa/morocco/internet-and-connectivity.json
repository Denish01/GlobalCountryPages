However, there is a noticeable urban vs rural divide, with faster and more reliable connections available in cities like Rabat, Casablanca, and Marrakech, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall reliability of the internet in Morocco is relatively high, with most users experiencing few issues with their connections.\n\nThe Moroccan government has been investing heavily in improving the country's internet infrastructure, with a focus on expanding fiber-optic networks and increasing mobile coverage. This has led to a significant improvement in internet speeds and availability, especially in urban areas. However, more needs to be done to address the rural-urban divide and ensure that all citizens have access to fast and reliable internet.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Morocco is relatively easy, with several options available for tourists and travelers. The main carriers, Orange, Maroc Telecom, and Inwi, all offer a range of plans and packages, including tourist-friendly options with data, voice, and text. To purchase a SIM card, you will typically need to provide a passport and proof of address, and the cost will be around 10 USD for a tourist SIM. You can buy SIM cards at airports, carrier stores, or from street vendors.\n\nThe best carriers for tourists are Orange and Maroc Telecom, which offer a range of plans and packages, including data-only options. Inwi is also a good option, with competitive pricing and good coverage. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card as soon as you arrive in Morocco, as this will give you access to data and voice services, and make it easier to navigate the country.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Orange | Tourist Plan | 1GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Maroc Telecom | Data Plan | 5GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Inwi | Tourist Plan | 2GB | 15 | Valid for 14 days |\n| Orange | Data Plan | 10GB | 30 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels and riads offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is widespread, with many cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular, especially in cities like Rabat and Casablanca, and often offer fast and reliable WiFi\n- Public WiFi is available in many cities, including Rabat and Marrakech, but can be slow and unreliable\n- Many restaurants and cafes also offer free WiFi, making it easy to stay connected while on the go\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like WeWork and Regus offer fast and reliable WiFi, as well as a range of amenities and services\n- Reliable cafe chains like Starbucks and Costa Coffee offer good WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options like portable WiFi hotspots and mobile data plans can be useful in case of an emergency\n- VPNs are recommended to ensure secure and private internet access, especially when working remotely\n- Many cities in Morocco also have a range of libraries and cultural centers that offer free WiFi and a quiet working environment\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Morocco, with some sites and services blocked or restricted\n- Blocked sites include some social media and news sites, as well as VPNs and proxy services\n- VPNs are recommended to ensure secure and private internet access, and to bypass any restrictions or censorship\n- Roaming alternatives like portable WiFi hotspots and local SIM cards can be more cost-effective than roaming with your home carrier\n- eSIM options are becoming increasingly available, and can be a convenient and flexible option for travelers\n- It's also a good idea to use a secure and reputable VPN provider, and to keep your devices and software up to date to ensure maximum security and protection.",
