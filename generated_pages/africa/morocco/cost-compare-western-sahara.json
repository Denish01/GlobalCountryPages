Morocco has a relatively diversified economy, with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and agriculture, which contributes to its higher GDP per capita. In contrast, Western Sahara has a smaller and more limited economy, with a significant dependence on phosphate mining and fishing.

The overall cost of living in Morocco is around 20-30% lower than in Western Sahara, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Morocco has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, public transportation, and amenities, which contributes to its lower costs. In contrast, Western Sahara has a more limited infrastructure, with higher costs for transportation, communication, and other services. Additionally, Morocco has a more competitive market, with a wider range of products and services available, which helps to keep prices low. Overall, Morocco's stronger economy and more developed infrastructure make it a more affordable option for those looking to live in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Morocco (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper in Morocco |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper in Morocco |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper in Morocco |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Morocco (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper in Morocco |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 400 | 25% cheaper in Morocco |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper in Morocco |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper in Morocco |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Morocco (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper in Morocco |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper in Morocco |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% cheaper in Morocco |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Morocco (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper in Morocco |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper in Morocco |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper in Morocco |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Morocco (USD) | Western Sahara (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 600 | 900 | 33% savings in Morocco |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% savings in Morocco |\n| Comfortable | 2,500 | 3,500 | 29% savings in Morocco |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Morocco is cheaper for:**\n  - Accommodation, with prices for apartments and houses generally lower than in Western Sahara\n  - Food, with a wider range of affordable dining options and lower prices for groceries\n  - Transportation, with lower costs for public transportation, taxis, and fuel\n  - Utilities, with lower prices for electricity, water, and internet\n- **Western Sahara is cheaper for:**\n  - Some imported goods, which may be cheaper due to the country's limited market and lower taxes\n  - Certain types of accommodation, such as shared apartments or guesthouses, which may be more affordable in Western Sahara\n  - Some types of food, such as fresh seafood, which may be cheaper in Western Sahara due to the country's coastal location\n  - Certain types of transportation, such as car rentals, which may be cheaper in Western Sahara due to the country's limited public transportation options\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nOverall, Morocco offers better value for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.
