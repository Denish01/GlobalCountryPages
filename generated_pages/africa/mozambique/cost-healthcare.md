[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and facilities, especially in rural areas. However, it is often the only option for many locals, particularly in rural areas. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, but at a higher cost. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals often relying on public services and foreigners opting for private care. While insurance is not required, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can be high and evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of serious illness or injury.

The quality of healthcare in Mozambique varies greatly between public and private providers. Public hospitals often lack basic equipment and medication, while private hospitals and clinics offer more modern facilities and better-trained staff. For example, the **Maputo Central Hospital** is one of the largest and best-equipped public hospitals in the country, but it still faces significant challenges, including limited resources and overcrowding. In contrast, private hospitals like the **Maputo Private Hospital** offer high-quality care, but at a much higher cost. Locals often rely on traditional medicine and community health workers, while foreigners tend to seek care from private providers. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the **National Health Service**, which provides free healthcare to all citizens, but the system still faces significant challenges.

In case of a medical emergency, it is best to call the local emergency number, 119, or seek care at a nearby hospital or clinic. Public hospitals often have limited resources and long wait times, while private hospitals offer more comprehensive care, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is often best to seek care at a private hospital or clinic, as they offer more modern facilities and better-trained staff. The **Maputo Private Hospital** and **Britannia Private Hospital** are two of the best private hospitals in the country, offering high-quality care and modern facilities. In case of serious illness or injury, evacuation to another country may be necessary, and having **travel insurance** that covers medical evacuation is highly recommended. It is also a good idea to research local hospitals and clinics before seeking care, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. Additionally, it is recommended to have a **first aid kit** and to know basic first aid techniques, as medical help may not always be readily available.
