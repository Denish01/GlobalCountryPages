        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Mozambique has a rich and complex history, with various empires and civilizations rising and falling over the centuries. The area that is now Mozambique was first inhabited by Bantu-speaking peoples around the 1st century AD. In the 10th century, the region was influenced by the <strong>Swahili</strong> trade network, which connected East Africa to the Indian Ocean and beyond. The <strong>Portuguese</strong> arrived in the 16th century, and by the 18th century, they had established a series of trading posts and colonies along the coast. Mozambique was officially declared a <strong>Portuguese colony</strong> in 1752.</p>
        <p>The Portuguese colonization of Mozambique lasted for nearly two centuries, during which time the country was exploited for its natural resources and labor. The <strong>Scramble for Africa</strong> in the late 19th century saw Mozambique become a key player in the European colonial powers' competition for territory and influence. In the mid-20th century, a nationalist movement emerged, led by figures such as <strong>Eduardo Mondlane</strong> and <strong>Samora Machel</strong>. Mozambique gained independence from Portugal on June 25, 1975, after a long and bloody struggle.</p>
        <p>Following independence, Mozambique became a <strong>socialist state</strong>, with close ties to the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries. However, the country was soon embroiled in a devastating <strong>civil war</strong>, which lasted from 1977 to 1992. The war was fought between the government, led by the <strong>FRELIMO</strong> party, and the <strong>RENAMO</strong> rebel group, which was supported by the <strong>apartheid regime</strong> in South Africa. The war had a profound impact on Mozambique, causing widespread destruction and displacement.</p>
        <p>In the years since the civil war, Mozambique has made significant progress in rebuilding and developing its economy. The country has become a <strong>democracy</strong>, with a multi-party system and regular elections. Mozambique has also made efforts to promote economic growth and reduce poverty, with a focus on <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>mining</strong>, and <strong>tourism</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Mozambique is a landlocked country"</p>
        <p>Reality: Mozambique has a long coastline along the Indian Ocean, with a total length of approximately 2,500 kilometers. The country's coastal region is home to a number of important ports and cities, including the capital, Maputo. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "The official language of Mozambique is African"</p>
        <p>Reality: The official language of Mozambique is <strong>Portuguese</strong>, which is spoken by the majority of the population. However, there are also many local languages spoken in the country, including <strong>Makonde</strong>, <strong>Chewa</strong>, and <strong>Sena</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Mozambique is a dangerous country to visit"</p>
        <p>Reality: While Mozambique does have a high crime rate, the country is generally considered to be safe for tourists. Visitors should take normal precautions to protect themselves and their belongings, but most areas of the country are considered to be stable and secure. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "The economy of Mozambique is based on agriculture"</p>
        <p>Reality: While agriculture is an important sector of the Mozambican economy, the country is also rich in natural resources, including <strong>coal</strong>, <strong>gas</strong>, and <strong>minerals</strong>. The mining sector is a significant contributor to the country's GDP, and Mozambique is also a major producer of <strong>cashews</strong> and other crops. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "The people of Mozambique are all black Africans"</p>
        <p>Reality: Mozambique is a culturally diverse country, with a population that includes people of <strong>African</strong>, <strong>European</strong>, and <strong>Asian</strong> descent. The country has a significant <strong>Indian</strong> community, as well as a number of <strong>Portuguese</strong> and other European expatriates. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Mozambique is a small country"</p>
        <p>Reality: Mozambique is actually a relatively large country, with a total area of approximately 886,379 square kilometers. The country is slightly smaller than the state of Texas, and is the 36th largest country in the world by land area. [/CALLOUT]</p>
