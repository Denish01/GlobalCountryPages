[SECTION] How Mozambique Is Divided [/SECTION]
Mozambique is divided into 10 provinces, each with its own unique character and identity. The provinces are further divided into districts, which are then subdivided into administrative posts. The provinces are: Cabo Delgado, Gaza, Inhambane, Manica, Maputo, Maputo City, Nampula, Niassa, Sofala, and Tete. Each province has its own capital city, and the provinces are grouped into three main regions: the north, the center, and the south.

The administrative structure of Mozambique is designed to promote decentralization and regional autonomy. The provinces have a significant degree of independence, with their own provincial governments and administrative systems. However, the central government in Maputo still plays a significant role in setting national policies and overseeing the overall development of the country. The provinces are also home to a diverse range of cultures, languages, and traditions, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage.

The road network is also extensive, although driving conditions can be challenging, especially during the rainy season. The country has several international airports, including Maputo International Airport, which receives flights from major airlines around the world. Additionally, the port city of Beira is an important hub for maritime trade and commerce, with regular shipments to and from other parts of Africa and beyond.

However, it's worth noting that transportation costs can be relatively high, especially for long-distance travel, and visitors should plan accordingly. Overall, getting around Mozambique requires some planning and flexibility, but with the right information and resources, it's possible to navigate the country with ease.
