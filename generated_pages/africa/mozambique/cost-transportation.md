[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique has a diverse range of transportation modes, including buses, minibuses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Maputo having a more comprehensive network of buses and taxis. Most people in Mozambique get around using **minibuses**, also known as **chapas**, which are a cheap and popular mode of transport. However, the roads in Mozambique can be challenging, especially during the rainy season, and traffic congestion is a common problem in major cities.

The government has invested in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the renovation of existing ones. Despite these efforts, the transportation system in Mozambique still faces many challenges, including a lack of funding, inadequate maintenance, and limited access to rural areas. As a result, many people rely on **informal transportation modes**, such as hitchhiking or using **bicycles**, to get around.
