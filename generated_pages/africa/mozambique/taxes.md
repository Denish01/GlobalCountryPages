[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique's tax system is based on a territorial taxation regime, where individuals and companies are taxed on their income derived from sources within the country. This means that individuals who are resident in Mozambique are taxed on their worldwide income, but only if it is derived from sources within the country. Non-residents, on the other hand, are only taxed on their income derived from sources within Mozambique. The residency rules for tax purposes in Mozambique are based on physical presence, where an individual is considered a resident if they have been present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year.

The tax system in Mozambique is administered by the Mozambican Tax Authority, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax guidance to taxpayers. The tax year in Mozambique runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of April of the following year. Mozambique has a tax treaty network with 12 countries, which helps to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion.
