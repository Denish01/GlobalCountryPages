The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Maputo having a more comprehensive network of buses and taxis. Most people in Mozambique get around using **minibuses**, also known as **chapas**, which are a cheap and popular mode of transport. However, the roads in Mozambique can be challenging, especially during the rainy season, and traffic congestion is a common problem in major cities.\n\nThe government has invested in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the renovation of existing ones. Despite these efforts, the transportation system in Mozambique still faces many challenges, including a lack of funding, inadequate maintenance, and limited access to rural areas. As a result, many people rely on **informal transportation modes**, such as hitchhiking or using **bicycles**, to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, mostly in Maputo |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Mozambique |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.50 | N/A | Extensive network, variable prices |\n| Commuter Train | $1-$3 | $20-$30 | Limited routes, mostly in Maputo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-$3 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$4 | $0.30-$0.60 | $5-$15 | Bolt, Uber available in Maputo |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, variable prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, variable prices |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mostly in Maputo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Variable prices, limited comfort |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, Maputo to Beira |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly for cargo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider using **minibuses** or **bicycles** for short distances.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like **Bolt** or **Uber** for convenient and relatively affordable transportation.\n- Always **negotiate taxi fares** before starting your journey, as prices can vary greatly.\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** and **road conditions**, especially during peak hours or in rural areas.\n- Consider **renting a car** for long-distance travel, but be prepared for variable road conditions and limited infrastructure.\n- Use **local currency** (MZN) for transportation costs, as not all providers accept USD.",
