[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique's population size is significant in the context of Africa, with the country ranking among the top 30 most populous countries in the world. The population growth rate is relatively high, with an average annual increase of 2.5%, which is driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and declining mortality rates. The urban population is growing rapidly, with approximately 37% of the population living in urban areas, with the capital city Maputo being the largest urban center. Migration patterns in Mozambique are influenced by economic factors, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of employment opportunities.

The population of Mozambique is also characterized by a high level of mobility, with many people moving across the country's borders to neighboring countries, such as South Africa and Tanzania, in search of work or to escape conflict. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with many Mozambicans living and working abroad. The government has implemented policies to manage migration and promote economic development, including initiatives to encourage foreign investment and create jobs in key sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing.

Despite these challenges, Mozambique has made significant progress in recent years in reducing poverty and improving living standards, with the poverty rate declining from approximately 60% in the early 2000s to around 45% today. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of access to basic services such as healthcare and education, particularly in rural areas.
