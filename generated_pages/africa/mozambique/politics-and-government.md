[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Mozambique is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and head of government. The President is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is limited to two terms. The President appoints a **Council of Ministers**, which is responsible for implementing government policies. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral **Assembly of the Republic**, which has 250 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the **Supreme Court** and lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly.

The political system in Mozambique is characterized by a **multi-party system**, where multiple parties compete for power and representation in the government. The main parties are the **FRELIMO** (Mozambican Liberation Front), which has been in power since independence in 1975, and the **RENAMO** (Mozambican National Resistance), which was a rebel group during the civil war and is now a major opposition party. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, which ensures that each branch of government has checks and balances on the others.

Mozambique has a **unitary system**, where the central government has authority over the entire country, and there are no autonomous regions or federal states. This system allows for a more centralized control over the government and the economy, but it can also lead to a lack of representation and autonomy for local communities.
