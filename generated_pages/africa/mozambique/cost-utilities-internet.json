The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities remains relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The quality of utility services also varies depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have more reliable access to electricity, water, and sanitation.\n\nThe inflation rate in Mozambique is around 4.1%, which can impact the cost of utilities and other essential services. However, the government has implemented measures to control inflation and stabilize the economy. The cost of utilities can also vary depending on the provider, with some companies offering more competitive rates than others. It's essential to research and compare prices before choosing a utility provider.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | prepaid and postpaid options available |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | includes sewage and sanitation |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | mostly used for cooking |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in water bill in some areas |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$135** | **$195** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Tmcel, Movitel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | Tmcel, Movitel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Vodacom, Tmcel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Vodacom, Tmcel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Tmcel, Movitel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in some areas with fast internet |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available with international credit card |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's recommended to visit the provider's office in person and bring required documents, such as a passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity is a popular option in Mozambique, as it allows users to control their spending and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Tmcel and Movitel are two of the most popular internet providers in Mozambique, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it's essential to use energy-efficient appliances and turn off lights, air conditioners, and other devices when not in use.\n- Considering a phone and internet bundle can be a cost-effective option, as it often includes additional services such as TV and streaming.",
