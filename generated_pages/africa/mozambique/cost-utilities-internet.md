[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique's utility infrastructure is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities remains relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The quality of utility services also varies depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have more reliable access to electricity, water, and sanitation.

The inflation rate in Mozambique is around 4.1%, which can impact the cost of utilities and other essential services. However, the government has implemented measures to control inflation and stabilize the economy. The cost of utilities can also vary depending on the provider, with some companies offering more competitive rates than others. It's essential to research and compare prices before choosing a utility provider.
