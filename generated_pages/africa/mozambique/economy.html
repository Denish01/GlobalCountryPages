        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Mozambique is a low-income economy with a growing population and a developing industrial base. The country has been transitioning from a planned economy to a market-based economy since the 1990s, with a focus on privatization and liberalization. The economy is driven primarily by agriculture, mining, and services, with a growing manufacturing sector. Mozambique's economy has been experiencing steady growth, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 7% over the past decade. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including high poverty rates, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of economic diversification.</p>
        <p>Mozambique's economic classification is as a low-income country, with a GDP per capita of around $433. The country has been working to improve its business environment and attract foreign investment, with a focus on sectors such as energy, agriculture, and tourism. The government has implemented various economic reforms, including the creation of a free trade zone and the simplification of tax procedures. Despite these efforts, Mozambique still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a lack of economic opportunities for its rapidly growing population.</p>
        <p>The country's economic trajectory is closely tied to the development of its natural resources, particularly coal, gas, and minerals. The discovery of large natural gas reserves off the coast of Mozambique has the potential to transform the country's economy, with estimates suggesting that the sector could generate billions of dollars in revenue per year. However, the development of these resources is still in its early stages, and the country faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, governance, and environmental sustainability.</p>

        <h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
        <p>Mozambique's economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven primarily by the development of its natural resources, particularly coal, gas, and minerals.

        <p>The development of Mozambique's natural gas reserves is expected to be a major driver of economic growth in the coming years. The country has signed several major deals with international companies to develop its gas reserves, which are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue per year. However, the development of these resources is still in its early stages, and the country faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, governance, and environmental sustainability. The government is working to address these challenges, including the development of new infrastructure, such as pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, and the implementation of new regulations and policies to ensure the sustainable development of the sector.</p>
