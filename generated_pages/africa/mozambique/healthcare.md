[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique's healthcare system is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the quality of care and access to facilities vary significantly between urban and rural areas. In urban areas like **Maputo**, the capital city, there are more healthcare facilities and better-equipped hospitals, while rural areas often have limited access to basic medical care. The private sector is also present, catering mainly to the affluent population and expatriates, with some high-quality hospitals and clinics offering specialized services.

The public healthcare system in Mozambique faces several challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. As a result, many Mozambicans rely on traditional medicine and alternative therapies. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the expansion of health insurance coverage and the introduction of new healthcare technologies. Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Mozambique still faces significant challenges, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare facilities and services is limited.

The quality of care in Mozambique's healthcare system is also a concern, with many hospitals and health centers lacking basic medical equipment and supplies. The country has a high burden of infectious diseases, including **malaria**, **HIV/AIDS**, and **tuberculosis**, which puts a significant strain on the healthcare system. However, there are also some positive developments, such as the introduction of new treatments and vaccines, and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.
