Mozambique's linguistic landscape is characterized by a mix of **Portuguese**, the official language, and various regional dialects and minority languages. While Portuguese is widely spoken, especially in urban areas and among the educated population, many Mozambicans also speak indigenous languages such as **Makhuwa**, **Sena**, and **Swahili**.

However, many Mozambicans in the tourism industry, such as hotel staff and tour guides, often speak some English.

Regional dialects and minority languages are an essential part of Mozambique's cultural heritage, and visitors may encounter different languages and dialects as they travel throughout the country.

English is not widely spoken in Mozambique, and visitors who speak only English may find it challenging to communicate with locals.

To get the most out of a visit to Mozambique, it is recommended that visitors learn some basic **Portuguese** phrases and carry a phrasebook or use a translation app.
