# Mozambique Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Mozambique before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and prior visa requirements for different nationalities. Currently, citizens of about 20 countries, including neighboring countries and some African nations, can enter Mozambique visa-free. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate tourism and business travel with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.

The Mozambican government has introduced an e-visa system to simplify the visa application process for eligible nationalities. The e-visa system allows applicants to submit their applications online and receive their visas via email. This has made it easier for tourists and business travelers to plan their trips to Mozambique. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Mozambique for the latest information.
