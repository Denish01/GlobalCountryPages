Mozambique has a growing economy, driven by its natural resources, agriculture, and tourism sectors, while Zimbabwe's economy has been facing challenges, including hyperinflation and a decline in its manufacturing sector. The cost of living in Mozambique is generally lower than in Zimbabwe, with accommodation, food, and transportation costs being significantly cheaper. However, Zimbabwe has a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which can make it a more attractive option for some expats and tourists.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Mozambique has a relatively stable economy, with a growing middle class and a increasing demand for goods and services. In contrast, Zimbabwe's economy has been facing significant challenges, including a severe cash crisis and a decline in the value of its currency. As a result, the cost of living in Zimbabwe can be volatile, with prices fluctuating rapidly in response to changes in the exchange rate and inflation. Overall, Mozambique is generally the cheaper option, with a cost of living that is around 20-30% lower than in Zimbabwe.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | Zimbabwe (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $350 | 43% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | Zimbabwe (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $50 | $100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | Zimbabwe (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | Zimbabwe (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $30 | $50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mozambique (USD) | Zimbabwe (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $500 | $800 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,500 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mozambique is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing\n- Food and dining\n- Transportation\n- Utilities and internet\n- **Zimbabwe is cheaper for:**\n- Certain luxury goods, such as electronics and clothing\n- High-end dining and entertainment options\n- Some tourist attractions and activities\n- Certain medical services and procedures\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMozambique offers better value for expats, students, and retirees who are looking for a low-cost lifestyle.

However, Zimbabwe may be a better option for those who value a more developed infrastructure, a wider range of amenities, and a more vibrant social scene. Ultimately, the choice between Mozambique and Zimbabwe depends on individual priorities and preferences. For those who are willing to trade off some comforts and amenities for a lower cost of living, Mozambique may be the better choice. But for those who value a more developed and modern lifestyle, Zimbabwe may be worth the extra expense.\n\nIn terms of specific lifestyle considerations, Mozambique may be a better option for families, who can take advantage of the country's low-cost housing and food options. On the other hand, Zimbabwe may be a better option for young professionals, who can take advantage of the country's more developed nightlife and social scene. Retirees may also find Mozambique to be a more attractive option, due to its low cost of living and warm climate.
