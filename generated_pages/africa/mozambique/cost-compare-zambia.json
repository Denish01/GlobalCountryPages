  "content": "Mozambique is generally cheaper than Zambia, with a cost of living that is approximately 20-30% lower, making it a more affordable destination for expats, travelers, and locals alike.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMozambique GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,244\nZambia GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,513\nMozambique Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nZambia Inflation Rate: 9.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Mozambique\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Mozambique vs Zambia [/SECTION]\nMozambique and Zambia are two neighboring countries in Southern Africa, both with unique cultural and economic contexts. Mozambique has a lower GDP per capita and a more stable inflation rate, which contributes to its overall lower cost of living. Zambia, on the other hand, has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, but also higher prices for goods and services. In general, Mozambique is a more affordable destination for daily expenses, accommodation, and transportation, while Zambia offers a more modern and developed infrastructure.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Mozambique's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, while Zambia's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on mining and manufacturing. This diversification has led to higher prices for goods and services in Zambia, making it more expensive than Mozambique. However, Zambia's more developed infrastructure and higher standard of living may make it a more attractive destination for some expats and travelers.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mozambique (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 800 | 37.5% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,000 | 1,500 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mozambique is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and accommodation\n- Food and dining\n- Transportation\n- Utilities and internet\n- **Zambia is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and entertainment\n- International travel and tourism\n- Luxury goods and services\n- Education and healthcare\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMozambique offers better value for expats, students, and travelers on a budget, with lower prices for daily expenses, accommodation, and transportation.
