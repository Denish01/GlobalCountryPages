[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambican cuisine is a fusion of different cultures, reflecting the country's history as a Portuguese colony and its location on the Indian Ocean trade route. The cuisine is characterized by the use of **piri piri**, a spicy chili pepper sauce, and **coconut milk**, which are commonly used in dishes like stews and curries. The country's long coastline also provides an abundance of fresh seafood, which is often grilled or fried and served with a side of **matapa**, a dish made with cassava leaves and peanuts.

Regional variations in Mozambican cuisine are also notable, with the north being influenced by Tanzanian and Malawian flavors, while the south is more closely tied to South African and Portuguese cuisine. In the capital city of Maputo, a blend of traditional and modern flavors can be found, with many restaurants serving a mix of African, Portuguese, and international dishes.

The use of local ingredients and traditional cooking methods is also an important aspect of Mozambican cuisine, with many dishes being cooked over an open flame or in a **cadari**, a type of clay oven. This approach to cooking helps to preserve the flavors and textures of the ingredients, resulting in dishes that are both flavorful and nutritious.
