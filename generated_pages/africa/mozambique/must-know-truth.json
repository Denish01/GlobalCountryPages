  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nMozambique has a rich and complex history, with various empires and civilizations rising and falling over the centuries. The area that is now Mozambique was first inhabited by Bantu-speaking peoples around the 1st century AD. In the 10th century, the region was influenced by the **Swahili** trade network, which connected East Africa to the Indian Ocean and beyond. The **Portuguese** arrived in the 16th century, and by the 18th century, they had established a series of trading posts and colonies along the coast. Mozambique was officially declared a **Portuguese colony** in 1752.\n\nThe Portuguese colonization of Mozambique lasted for nearly two centuries, during which time the country was exploited for its natural resources and labor.
