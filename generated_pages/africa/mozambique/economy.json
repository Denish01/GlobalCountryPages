  "content": "[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($14.4 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($433 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Low)\nMain Industries: (aluminum, coal, agriculture)\nCurrency: MZN\nUnemployment Rate: (24% approximate)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 135 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nMozambique is a low-income economy with a growing population and a developing industrial base. The country has been transitioning from a planned economy to a market-based economy since the 1990s, with a focus on privatization and liberalization. The economy is driven primarily by agriculture, mining, and services, with a growing manufacturing sector. Mozambique's economy has been experiencing steady growth, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 7% over the past decade. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including high poverty rates, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of economic diversification.\n\nMozambique's economic classification is as a low-income country, with a GDP per capita of around $433. The country has been working to improve its business environment and attract foreign investment, with a focus on sectors such as energy, agriculture, and tourism. The government has implemented various economic reforms, including the creation of a free trade zone and the simplification of tax procedures. Despite these efforts, Mozambique still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a lack of economic opportunities for its rapidly growing population.\n\nThe country's economic trajectory is closely tied to the development of its natural resources, particularly coal, gas, and minerals. The discovery of large natural gas reserves off the coast of Mozambique has the potential to transform the country's economy, with estimates suggesting that the sector could generate billions of dollars in revenue per year. However, the development of these resources is still in its early stages, and the country faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, governance, and environmental sustainability.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 25% of GDP | Main crops include cotton, cashews, sugarcane, and tobacco |\n| Mining | 15% of GDP | Coal, gold, and precious stones are the main minerals extracted |\n| Manufacturing | 12% of GDP | Textiles, food processing, and beverages are the main manufacturing sectors |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | Financial services, trade, and tourism are the main service sectors |\n| Energy | 5% of GDP | The country has significant potential for renewable energy, particularly hydro and solar power |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Aluminum**: Mozambique is a significant producer of aluminum, with the majority of its exports going to Europe and Asia\n- **Coal**: The country has large coal reserves, with exports going primarily to China and India\n- **Cashews**: Mozambique is one of the world's largest producers of cashews, with exports going to Europe, Asia, and the United States\n- **Sugarcane**: The country produces significant quantities of sugarcane, with exports going primarily to Europe and Asia\n- **Tobacco**: Mozambique is a significant producer of tobacco, with exports going primarily to Europe and Asia\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery**: The country imports significant quantities of machinery, particularly for the mining and manufacturing sectors\n- **Fuel**: Mozambique imports fuel, particularly diesel and gasoline, to meet its energy needs\n- **Vehicles**: The country imports vehicles, particularly trucks and buses, for use in the transportation sector\n- **Electronics**: Mozambique imports electronics, particularly computers and telecommunications equipment, for use in the services sector\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: The country imports pharmaceuticals, particularly medicines and medical equipment, for use in the health sector\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- South Africa: Mozambique's largest trading partner, with significant trade in goods and services\n- China: A major trading partner, particularly in the mining and energy sectors\n- India: A significant trading partner, particularly in the mining and manufacturing sectors\n- Portugal: A historic trading partner, with significant trade in goods and services\n- United States: A growing trading partner, particularly in the energy and manufacturing sectors\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country has a relatively underdeveloped transport network, with a total of around 30,000 kilometers of roads, of which only around 20% are paved\n- Mozambique has significant energy potential, particularly in the form of hydro and solar power, but the country still relies heavily on imported fuel to meet its energy needs\n- The country has a growing telecommunications sector, with around 20% of the population having access to the internet and around 50% having access to mobile phone services\n- Mozambique has several major ports, including the Port of Maputo and the Port of Beira, which are significant hubs for trade and commerce\n- The country has several international airports, including the Maputo International Airport and the Beira International Airport, which provide connections to major cities in Africa, Europe, and Asia\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nMozambique's economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven primarily by the development of its natural resources, particularly coal, gas, and minerals.

The government has implemented various economic reforms, including the creation of a free trade zone and the simplification of tax procedures, which are expected to help improve the country's competitiveness and attractiveness to investors.\n\nThe development of Mozambique's natural gas reserves is expected to be a major driver of economic growth in the coming years. The country has signed several major deals with international companies to develop its gas reserves, which are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue per year. However, the development of these resources is still in its early stages, and the country faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, governance, and environmental sustainability. The government is working to address these challenges, including the development of new infrastructure, such as pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, and the implementation of new regulations and policies to ensure the sustainable development of the sector.",
