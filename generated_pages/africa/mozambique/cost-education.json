  "content": "The cost of education in Mozambique varies depending on the type of institution and the level of education, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools and international institutions can be quite expensive.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 6.0%\nLiteracy Rate: 60%\nSchool System: 7 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: MZN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nMozambique's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. The quality of education in public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking basic infrastructure and resources, while others provide a good quality education. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to offer a higher quality education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction in Mozambique is **Portuguese**, and compulsory education lasts for 7 years, from age 6 to 13. International schools are available in major cities, such as Maputo and Beira, and offer a range of curricula, including **British**, **American**, and **International Baccalaureate**.\n\nThe education system in Mozambique faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. However, the government has been working to improve the education sector, with a focus on increasing access to education, particularly for girls and disadvantaged groups. Despite these challenges, Mozambique has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with the number of children enrolled in school increasing significantly in recent years.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$50 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range by tier, from basic to high-end |\n| Public Secondary | $50-$100 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range by tier, from basic to high-end |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | Curriculum types include British, American, and International Baccalaureate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited availability for international students |\n| Private University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Range by institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Universidade Eduardo Mondlane is a top-ranked university |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Varying quality and availability |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Range by subject and tutor qualification |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Portuguese language courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Basic supplies, such as textbooks and uniforms |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Mozambique are often international schools, which offer a high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- Scholarships are available for Mozambican students, particularly for those studying at public universities.\n- Online learning options are limited in Mozambique, but some universities offer distance learning programs.\n- The education quality in Mozambique is generally lower than in other countries in the region, but there are some good quality schools and universities available.\n- Expats should research schools carefully and consider factors such as curriculum, facilities, and teacher qualifications when choosing a school.\n- [CALLOUT] It is essential to plan carefully and budget for education costs in Mozambique, as they can be significant, especially for private and international schools.",
