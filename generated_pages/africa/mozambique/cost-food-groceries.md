[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Mozambique are generally lower compared to the regional average, making it an affordable destination for travelers and locals alike. However, prices can fluctuate due to factors such as seasonal availability of produce, transportation costs, and inflation. The **inflation rate** of 4.1% in 2024 can drive up prices, especially for imported goods. Despite this, many Mozambicans prefer to cook at home, and the **eating-out culture** is not as prevalent as in other countries. This is partly due to the affordability of ingredients and the cultural significance of traditional meals prepared at home.

In general, food prices in Mozambique are influenced by the country's **agricultural production**, with many staple crops such as **maize**, **rice**, and **cassava** being locally produced. However, the lack of infrastructure and transportation networks can increase costs, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the reliance on imported goods, such as **wheat** and **sugar**, can drive up prices. Despite these challenges, the **local market** remains a vital source of fresh produce, and many Mozambicans rely on these markets for their daily groceries.
