  "content": "Mozambique is generally cheaper than South Africa, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMozambique GDP per Capita (PPP): $1,244\nSouth Africa GDP per Capita (PPP): $6,440\nMozambique Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nSouth Africa Inflation Rate: 4.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Mozambique\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Mozambique vs South Africa [/SECTION]\nMozambique and South Africa are two neighboring countries in Southern Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Mozambique has a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy compared to South Africa, which is one of the most developed countries on the continent. However, Mozambique's lower cost of living makes it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle. The country's economy is largely driven by agriculture, mining, and tourism, while South Africa has a more diversified economy with a strong services sector.\n\nThe cost of living in Mozambique is generally lower compared to South Africa, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper. However, the quality of infrastructure and services in Mozambique can be lower compared to South Africa, which may affect the overall quality of life. For example, while renting a one-bedroom apartment in Maputo, the capital city of Mozambique, can cost around $200-300 per month, a similar apartment in Johannesburg, South Africa can cost around $400-600 per month. Overall, Mozambique offers a more affordable lifestyle, but with some trade-offs in terms of infrastructure and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $250 | $450 | 44% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $300 | 50% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $450 | $800 | 44% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mozambique (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $30 | $50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mozambique (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $500 | $800 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,500 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | $1,500 | $2,500 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mozambique is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing\n- Food and dining\n- Transportation\n- Utilities and internet\n- **South Africa is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and entertainment\n- International travel and tourism\n- Luxury goods and services\n- Access to high-quality healthcare and education\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMozambique offers a more affordable lifestyle compared to South Africa, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.

On the other hand, for those who value high-quality infrastructure and services, South Africa may be a better choice. Ultimately, the decision between Mozambique and South Africa depends on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences.\n\nIn terms of specific lifestyle needs, Mozambique may be more suitable for digital nomads and remote workers who are looking for a low-cost lifestyle and a relaxed atmosphere. South Africa, on the other hand, may be more suitable for families and professionals who value high-quality education and healthcare, as well as access to international travel and tourism opportunities.
