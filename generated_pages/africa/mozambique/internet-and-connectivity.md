[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Mozambique has been expanding and improving in recent years, with the average internet speed reaching 5 Mbps download. However, there is a significant divide between urban and rural areas, with urban centers like Maputo and Beira enjoying better connectivity and faster speeds, while rural areas often struggle with slower and less reliable connections. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by power outages and infrastructure issues, but overall, the situation is gradually improving, with more people gaining access to the internet and mobile networks.

Despite these challenges, the Mozambican government has been investing in the development of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, including the expansion of fiber-optic networks and the improvement of mobile coverage. This has led to an increase in internet penetration, with more people using the internet for various purposes, including education, commerce, and communication. However, there is still a long way to go, especially in terms of addressing the urban-rural divide and improving the overall quality and reliability of the internet.
