The market is still relatively underdeveloped, offering opportunities for investors to acquire properties at competitive prices. However, the market is also subject to fluctuations, and prices can vary depending on the location, with urban areas like Maputo and Beira tend to be more expensive than rural areas. The price trajectory has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with some areas experiencing higher growth rates than others.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is significant in Mozambique, with urban areas offering better infrastructure, amenities, and economic opportunities. However, rural areas also offer investment opportunities, particularly in the agriculture and tourism sectors. The government has implemented policies to encourage investment in rural areas, such as tax incentives and subsidies for agricultural development. Despite these efforts, the rural property market remains relatively underdeveloped, and investors may face challenges such as limited access to financing and infrastructure.\n\nThe current market conditions are favorable for investors, with a range of properties available, from luxury apartments to commercial developments and rural land. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with investing in a developing market, such as fluctuations in the currency and potential changes in government policies. Overall, the property market in Mozambique offers opportunities for investors looking to tap into the country's growing economy and urbanization trends.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Maputo | 1,200 | 800 | Apartment |\n| Beira | 800 | 500 | House |\n| Nampula | 600 | 300 | Apartment |\n| Quelimane | 400 | 200 | House |\n| Tete | 300 | 150 | Land |\n| Inhambane | 250 | 100 | Beachfront property |\n| Chimoio | 200 | 80 | Commercial property |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Mozambique, but they must obtain a residence permit or a work visa to do so.\n- Foreigners can also buy property through a company, which can provide additional benefits such as tax incentives and easier ownership transfer.\n- However, foreigners are restricted from buying property in certain areas, such as border zones and areas designated for national security.\n- Foreigners must also obtain a permit from the Ministry of Justice to buy property, which can take several months to process.\n- Foreigners can lease property for up to 99 years, which can provide a workaround for those who do not want to buy property outright.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
