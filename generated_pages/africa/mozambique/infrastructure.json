  "content": "Mozambique's infrastructure is still developing, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, power, and water systems, but there remains a considerable gap between urban and rural areas in terms of access to these services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 29% of population\nInternet Penetration: 15%\nRoad Network: 30,331 km, with 20% paved\nRail Network: 3,123 km\nMajor Airports: 15\nMajor Ports: 5\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMozambique's infrastructure development level is still relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Despite recent investments, the country still faces significant challenges in providing reliable and efficient services to its population. The government has been working to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation, as well as upgrading the road network. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to these basic services. The government has also been working to attract foreign investment to support infrastructure development, with a focus on **public-private partnerships**.\n\nThe urban-rural gap in infrastructure access is a significant challenge for Mozambique. While cities like Maputo and Beira have relatively well-developed infrastructure, many rural areas lack even basic services like electricity and clean water. This has significant implications for the country's economic development, as well as the health and well-being of its population. The government has been working to address this gap, with programs like the **Rural Electrification Program** aimed at increasing access to electricity in rural areas.\n\nIn recent years, Mozambique has seen significant investments in its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and ports. The country has also seen an increase in foreign investment, particularly in the energy and mining sectors. This has helped to drive economic growth and improve living standards, but there is still much work to be done to address the country's infrastructure challenges.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 30,331 km | Poor | Many roads are in disrepair, particularly in rural areas |\n| Railways | 3,123 km | Moderate | Rail network is limited, but being upgraded |\n| Airports | 15 international and domestic | Good | Major airports are well-equipped, but smaller airports lack facilities |\n| Ports | 5 major | Good | Major ports like Maputo and Beira are well-equipped, but smaller ports lack facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Mozambique's power generation is primarily based on **hydroelectric power**, with the Cahora Bassa Dam being the country's largest power plant.\n- The country's electricity grid is still relatively underdeveloped, with many areas lacking access to reliable power.\n- **Power outages** are common, particularly during periods of high demand or when there are technical problems with the grid.\n- The government has been working to increase access to electricity, with a focus on **renewable energy sources** like solar and wind power.\n- Mozambique has significant potential for **natural gas** production, with several major discoveries made in recent years.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern in Mozambique, with many areas lacking access to clean drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, particularly in rural areas, where many communities lack access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- The government has been working to improve access to **clean water**, with a focus on upgrading water treatment plants and expanding piped water networks.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on **traditional wells** or **rainwater collection**.\n- The country has made progress in increasing access to **improved sanitation facilities**, but there is still much work to be done to address the needs of rural communities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread in Mozambique, with several major operators providing services.\n- **Fiber optic networks** are being rolled out in major cities, but **broadband penetration** is still relatively low.\n- The government has been working to improve **telecommunications infrastructure**, with a focus on increasing access to **4G** and **5G** networks.\n- **Postal services** are limited, particularly in rural areas, where many communities lack access to reliable mail services.\n- The country has seen significant growth in **mobile money** services, with several major operators providing services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Nacala Corridor** project aims to upgrade the road and rail network between Mozambique and Malawi, with a focus on improving trade and economic development in the region.\n- The **Mozambique LNG** project aims to develop the country's natural gas resources, with a focus on exporting LNG to international markets.\n- The **Beira Port** expansion project aims to upgrade the port's facilities and increase its capacity, with a focus on improving trade and economic development in the region.\n- The **Rural Electrification Program** aims to increase access to electricity in rural areas, with a focus on using **renewable energy sources** like solar and wind power.\n- The **Maputo-Katembe Bridge** project aims to construct a new bridge over the Maputo Bay, with a focus on improving transport links between the city and the surrounding region.",
