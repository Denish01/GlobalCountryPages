[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by cooler temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is hot and humid, with most of the country's annual rainfall occurring during this period. The climate varies across different regions, with the north being generally hotter and more humid than the south. The dry season is the best time to visit Mozambique's **national parks** and **game reserves**, as the dry conditions make it easier to spot wildlife.

The wet season, on the other hand, is not ideal for outdoor activities, but it's a great time to see the country's **waterfalls** and **rivers** in full flow. The wet season is also a good time to visit Mozambique's **islands**, such as the **Bazaruto Archipelago**, as the warm waters and coral reefs are perfect for **snorkeling** and **diving**.

The **mountainous regions**, such as the **Gorongosa Mountains**, have a cooler climate than the rest of the country, making them a great destination for **hiking** and **trekking**.
