However, prices can fluctuate due to factors such as seasonal availability of produce, transportation costs, and inflation. The **inflation rate** of 4.1% in 2024 can drive up prices, especially for imported goods. Despite this, many Mozambicans prefer to cook at home, and the **eating-out culture** is not as prevalent as in other countries. This is partly due to the affordability of ingredients and the cultural significance of traditional meals prepared at home.\n\nIn general, food prices in Mozambique are influenced by the country's **agricultural production**, with many staple crops such as **maize**, **rice**, and **cassava** being locally produced. However, the lack of infrastructure and transportation networks can increase costs, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the reliance on imported goods, such as **wheat** and **sugar**, can drive up prices. Despite these challenges, the **local market** remains a vital source of fresh produce, and many Mozambicans rely on these markets for their daily groceries.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.20 | 60 MZN | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.80 | 40 MZN | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.50 | 75 MZN | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $0.80 | 40 MZN | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 175 MZN | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00 | 250 MZN | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50 | 125 MZN | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 50 MZN | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 40 MZN | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 30 MZN | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 200 MZN | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 50 MZN | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | (typical dishes like **matapa** or **arroz de coco**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | (one person, **prato do dia**) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$25 | (3 courses, **restaurantes de meio escalão**) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | (upscale, **restaurantes finos**) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $1.50-$2.50 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $3.00-$5.00 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2.00-$3.50 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1.00-$2.00 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly between **supermarkets** and **local markets**.
