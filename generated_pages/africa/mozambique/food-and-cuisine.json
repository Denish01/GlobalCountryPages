The cuisine is characterized by the use of **piri piri**, a spicy chili pepper sauce, and **coconut milk**, which are commonly used in dishes like stews and curries. The country's long coastline also provides an abundance of fresh seafood, which is often grilled or fried and served with a side of **matapa**, a dish made with cassava leaves and peanuts.\n\nRegional variations in Mozambican cuisine are also notable, with the north being influenced by Tanzanian and Malawian flavors, while the south is more closely tied to South African and Portuguese cuisine. In the capital city of Maputo, a blend of traditional and modern flavors can be found, with many restaurants serving a mix of African, Portuguese, and international dishes.\n\nThe use of local ingredients and traditional cooking methods is also an important aspect of Mozambican cuisine, with many dishes being cooked over an open flame or in a **cadari**, a type of clay oven. This approach to cooking helps to preserve the flavors and textures of the ingredients, resulting in dishes that are both flavorful and nutritious.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Calulu | Stew | Fish or meat stew made with vegetables and peanuts | Restaurants in Maputo and coastal towns |\n| Matapa | Side dish | Cassava leaves cooked with peanuts and coconut milk | Traditional restaurants and markets |\n| Prego | Sandwich | Grilled meat sandwich served with a side of fries | Street food stalls and cafes |\n| Arroz de Pescado | Rice dish | Fish and rice cooked with spices and coconut milk | Seafood restaurants in coastal towns |\n| Xima | Porridge | Cornmeal porridge served with a side of vegetables or meat | Traditional restaurants and markets |\n| Frango Grelhado | Grilled chicken | Marinated chicken grilled over an open flame | Street food stalls and restaurants |\n| Catatu | Stew | Peanut-based stew made with meat or fish and vegetables | Traditional restaurants and markets |\n| Maluvo | Soup | Fish and vegetable soup made with coconut milk and spices | Restaurants in coastal towns |\n| Bitoque | Steak | Grilled steak served with a side of fries and vegetables | Restaurants in urban areas |\n| Cocada | Dessert | Coconut-based dessert made with eggs and sugar | Bakeries and cafes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Prego** sandwiches, typically costing $3-$5 USD\n- **Frango Grelhado**, grilled chicken, usually priced at $5-$7 USD\n- **Fried plantains**, a popular snack, costing $1-$2 USD\n- **Maluva**, a type of fried doughnut, typically priced at $1-$2 USD\n- **Cassava chips**, a crunchy snack, usually costing $2-$3 USD\n- **Fresh coconut water**, a refreshing drink, typically priced at $1-$2 USD\n- **Grilled corn on the cob**, a common street food, usually costing $1-$2 USD\n- **Piri piri** flavored nuts, a spicy snack, typically priced at $2-$3 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Laurentina**, a local beer, typically costing $2-$3 USD\n- **Manica**, a type of soda, usually priced at $1-$2 USD\n- **Fresh coconut water**, a refreshing drink, typically costing $1-$2 USD\n- **Piri piri** flavored juice, a spicy drink, usually priced at $2-$3 USD\n- **Mozambican coffee**, a strong and rich coffee, typically costing $1-$2 USD\n- **Tea with ginger and lemon**, a soothing drink, usually priced at $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- It is customary to eat with your hands, especially when eating traditional dishes like **matapa** and **xima**\n- **Tipping** is expected, with 5-10% of the total bill being the norm\n- **Reservations** are usually not necessary, except for high-end restaurants\n- **Dress code** is casual, except for upscale restaurants\n- **Eating etiquette** is relaxed, but it is considered impolite to eat with your left hand\n- **Sharing food** is a common practice, especially when eating with locals\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Markets**, such as the Maputo Central Market, offer a wide variety of traditional dishes and fresh produce\n- **Food courts**, like the ones found in shopping malls, provide a range of options, from local cuisine to international fast food\n- **Restaurants**, ranging from high-end to casual, can be found in urban areas and tourist destinations\n- **Street food stalls**, commonly found in markets and along streets, offer a variety of snacks and meals\n- **Cafes**, often serving coffee, pastries, and light meals, are popular gathering places\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Maputo Central Market**, a large market offering a wide variety of fresh produce, meats, and traditional dishes\n- **Feira Popular**, a popular market in Maputo, featuring a range of food stalls and vendors\n- **Inhambane Market**, a bustling market in the coastal town of Inhambane, offering fresh seafood and local specialties\n- **Mozambique Food Festival**, an annual festival celebrating the country's cuisine, featuring traditional dishes, live music, and cultural performances\n- **Cooking classes**, available in some restaurants and culinary schools, offering the opportunity to learn about traditional Mozambican cuisine and cooking techniques",
