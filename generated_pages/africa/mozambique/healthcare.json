  "content": "Mozambique's healthcare system is a mixed model with both public and private providers, offering varying levels of quality and accessibility, particularly in urban areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 119\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nMozambique's healthcare system is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the quality of care and access to facilities vary significantly between urban and rural areas. In urban areas like **Maputo**, the capital city, there are more healthcare facilities and better-equipped hospitals, while rural areas often have limited access to basic medical care. The private sector is also present, catering mainly to the affluent population and expatriates, with some high-quality hospitals and clinics offering specialized services.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Mozambique faces several challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. As a result, many Mozambicans rely on traditional medicine and alternative therapies. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the expansion of health insurance coverage and the introduction of new healthcare technologies. Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Mozambique still faces significant challenges, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare facilities and services is limited.\n\nThe quality of care in Mozambique's healthcare system is also a concern, with many hospitals and health centers lacking basic medical equipment and supplies. The country has a high burden of infectious diseases, including **malaria**, **HIV/AIDS**, and **tuberculosis**, which puts a significant strain on the healthcare system. However, there are also some positive developments, such as the introduction of new treatments and vaccines, and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital Central de Maputo | Maputo | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Sommerschield | Maputo | Private | General medicine, cardiology, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Hospital Geral de Beira | Beira | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Polyclinica | Nampula | Private | General medicine, dentistry, ophthalmology | Yes |\n| Hospital Rural de Manica | Manica | Public | General medicine, pediatrics, maternal health | Limited |\n| Clinica Mozambique | Maputo | Private | General medicine, cardiology, gastroenterology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for expatriates and foreigners, as it provides access to better-equipped hospitals and clinics.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but the coverage and quality of services may vary.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** plans often include evacuation coverage, which is essential in case of a medical emergency.\n- **Costs** of health insurance in Mozambique can be high, especially for comprehensive plans.\n- **Government-sponsored health insurance** is available for citizens, but the coverage is limited and the quality of care may vary.\n- **International health insurance** companies operate in Mozambique, offering a range of plans and coverage options.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medication availability** is generally good in urban areas, but can be limited in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including **generic** and **international** brands.\n- **Costs** of medications can be high, especially for imported brands.\n- **Pharmacy access** is moderate, with many pharmacies located in urban areas, but fewer in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for travelers arriving from or passing through infected areas.\n- **Malaria prophylaxis** is recommended for travelers to certain areas, especially during the rainy season.\n- **Hepatitis A and B vaccinations** are recommended for all travelers.\n- **Typhoid vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Rabies vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be spending time around animals.\n- **Cholera vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be working in healthcare or with vulnerable populations.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Mozambique is not a major medical tourism destination**, but some private hospitals and clinics offer specialized services, such as **cosmetic surgery** and **dentistry**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Clinica Sommerschield and the Polyclinica, which offer high-quality medical care and services.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, especially for procedures like **dentistry** and **cosmetic surgery**.\n- **Popular procedures** include **plastic surgery**, **orthopedic surgery**, and **cardiology**.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In case of an emergency**, call the emergency number 119 or go to the nearest hospital.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is limited, especially in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be far away, especially in rural areas.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, so it's essential to have a good understanding of your insurance coverage and procedures.\n- **Emergency evacuation** may be necessary in severe cases, and having evacuation coverage as part of your health insurance plan is essential.",
