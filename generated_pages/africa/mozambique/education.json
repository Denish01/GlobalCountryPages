Primary education, also known as **Ensino Primário**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12 and consists of 7 years of schooling. Secondary education, or **Ensino Secundário**, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle consists of 2 years of general education, while the second cycle consists of 3 years of specialized education. Tertiary education, or **Ensino Superior**, includes universities and polytechnic institutes that offer a range of academic programs. The quality of education in Mozambique varies, with public schools generally considered to be of lower quality than private schools. However, the government has been working to improve the quality of education, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe public education system in Mozambique is free, but many families choose to send their children to private schools, which are generally considered to be of higher quality. Private schools offer a range of academic programs, including international curricula such as the **International Baccalaureate (IB)**. However, these schools are often expensive and out of reach for many families. The government has also introduced programs to improve the quality of education, such as the **Parque Escolar** program, which aims to improve the infrastructure and resources of public schools.\n\nDespite these efforts, the education system in Mozambique still faces many challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to education in rural areas. The government has been working to address these challenges, but much work remains to be done to improve the quality and accessibility of education in Mozambique.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
