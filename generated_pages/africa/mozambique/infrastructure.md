# Mozambique Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Mozambique's infrastructure is still developing, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, power, and water systems, but there remains a considerable gap between urban and rural areas in terms of access to these services.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 29% of population
Internet Penetration: 15%
Road Network: 30,331 km, with 20% paved
Rail Network: 3,123 km
Major Airports: 15
Major Ports: 5
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Mozambique's infrastructure development level is still relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Despite recent investments, the country still faces significant challenges in providing reliable and efficient services to its population. The government has been working to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation, as well as upgrading the road network. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to these basic services. The government has also been working to attract foreign investment to support infrastructure development, with a focus on **public-private partnerships**.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure access is a significant challenge for Mozambique. While cities like Maputo and Beira have relatively well-developed infrastructure, many rural areas lack even basic services like electricity and clean water. This has significant implications for the country's economic development, as well as the health and well-being of its population. The government has been working to address this gap, with programs like the **Rural Electrification Program** aimed at increasing access to electricity in rural areas.

In recent years, Mozambique has seen significant investments in its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and ports. The country has also seen an increase in foreign investment, particularly in the energy and mining sectors. This has helped to drive economic growth and improve living standards, but there is still much work to be done to address the country's infrastructure challenges.
