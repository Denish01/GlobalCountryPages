Private schools, on the other hand, tend to offer a higher quality education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction in Mozambique is **Portuguese**, and compulsory education lasts for 7 years, from age 6 to 13. International schools are available in major cities, such as Maputo and Beira, and offer a range of curricula, including **British**, **American**, and **International Baccalaureate**.

The education system in Mozambique faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. However, the government has been working to improve the education sector, with a focus on increasing access to education, particularly for girls and disadvantaged groups. Despite these challenges, Mozambique has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with the number of children enrolled in school increasing significantly in recent years.
