However, there is a significant divide between urban and rural areas, with urban centers like Maputo and Beira enjoying better connectivity and faster speeds, while rural areas often struggle with slower and less reliable connections. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by power outages and infrastructure issues, but overall, the situation is gradually improving, with more people gaining access to the internet and mobile networks.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Mozambican government has been investing in the development of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, including the expansion of fiber-optic networks and the improvement of mobile coverage. This has led to an increase in internet penetration, with more people using the internet for various purposes, including education, commerce, and communication. However, there is still a long way to go, especially in terms of addressing the urban-rural divide and improving the overall quality and reliability of the internet.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Mozambique, tourists and travelers can visit the offices of the main mobile carriers, such as Vodacom, Mcel, and Movitel, which are usually located in major cities and towns. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, and the process is usually straightforward and quick. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 5 USD, and data plans are available starting from around 1 USD per day for 100 MB of data.\n\nIt is recommended to purchase a SIM card from one of the main carriers, as they offer better coverage and more reliable connections.
