  "content": "Mozambique is governed as a **unitary semi-presidential republic**, where the President serves as both the head of state and head of government, with a multi-party system and a separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Semi-Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President, Filipe Nyusi\nHead of Government: President, Filipe Nyusi\nLegislature: Assembly of the Republic, unicameral, 250 seats\nLegal System: Civil law system, based on Portuguese law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 134 out of 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 146 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Mozambique is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and head of government. The President is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is limited to two terms. The President appoints a **Council of Ministers**, which is responsible for implementing government policies. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral **Assembly of the Republic**, which has 250 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the **Supreme Court** and lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly.\n\nThe political system in Mozambique is characterized by a **multi-party system**, where multiple parties compete for power and representation in the government. The main parties are the **FRELIMO** (Mozambican Liberation Front), which has been in power since independence in 1975, and the **RENAMO** (Mozambican National Resistance), which was a rebel group during the civil war and is now a major opposition party. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, which ensures that each branch of government has checks and balances on the others.\n\nMozambique has a **unitary system**, where the central government has authority over the entire country, and there are no autonomous regions or federal states. This system allows for a more centralized control over the government and the economy, but it can also lead to a lack of representation and autonomy for local communities.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Filipe Nyusi | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Prime Minister Adriano Maleiane | Implements government policies |\n| Legislative | Assembly of the Republic | Speaker Esperança Bias | Makes laws and approves government policies |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Interprets the law and ensures its application |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FRELIMO | Center-left | Filipe Nyusi | 184 | Ruling party since 1975 |\n| RENAMO | Center-right | Ossufo Momade | 60 | Main opposition party |\n| MDM | Center | Daviz Simango | 6 | Third-largest party |\n| UNAMO | Center-left | Jose Dos Santos | 0 | Small opposition party |\n| PIMO | Center-right | Yussuf Adam | 0 | Small opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Mozambique is based on **proportional representation**, where parties are allocated seats in proportion to the number of votes they receive.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the last presidential and legislative elections taking place in 2019.\n- The next elections are scheduled to take place in 2024.\n- Voter participation has been increasing in recent years, with over 50% of eligible voters participating in the 2019 elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Mozambique is characterized by a **fragile peace**, following a long civil war that ended in 1992.\n- Key issues facing the government include **poverty**, **corruption**, and **economic inequality**.\n- Regional dynamics, such as the **SADC** (Southern African Development Community) and the **AU** (African Union), play an important role in shaping Mozambique's foreign policy and regional relations.\n- Freedom indices, such as the **Freedom in the World** report, have ranked Mozambique as \"partly free\", citing concerns over **human rights** and **press freedom**.\n- The country is also facing **security challenges**, including attacks by armed groups in the north of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Mozambique is a member of the **United Nations**, the **African Union**, and the **Southern African Development Community** (SADC).\n- The country has **good relations** with neighboring countries, including South Africa and Tanzania.\n- Mozambique has also **strengthened ties** with countries such as China and Brazil, which have invested heavily in the country's infrastructure and natural resources.\n- The country has a **diplomatic stance** that is focused on promoting regional stability and cooperation, and has played a key role in regional organizations such as the SADC.",
