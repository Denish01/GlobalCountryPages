[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nMozambique has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and prior visa requirements for different nationalities. Currently, citizens of about 20 countries, including neighboring countries and some African nations, can enter Mozambique visa-free. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate tourism and business travel with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.\n\nThe Mozambican government has introduced an e-visa system to simplify the visa application process for eligible nationalities. The e-visa system allows applicants to submit their applications online and receive their visas via email. This has made it easier for tourists and business travelers to plan their trips to Mozambique. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Mozambique for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival or prior to travel |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival or prior to travel |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival or prior to travel, except for Portuguese citizens who are visa-free |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival or prior to travel |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival or prior to travel |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must be obtained prior to travel |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must be obtained prior to travel |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can obtain a visa on arrival or prior to travel, depending on their nationality.
