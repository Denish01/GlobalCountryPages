[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Mozambique has several international airports, with Maputo International Airport (MPM) being the main entry point for most travelers. The airport is located about 3 miles northwest of the city center and offers flights to several African and European destinations, including Johannesburg, Nairobi, and Lisbon. Beira International Airport (BEW) is another major airport, located in the central part of the country, and offers flights to regional destinations such as Harare and Dar es Salaam. For those traveling overland, Mozambique shares borders with several countries, including Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Eswatini, and Madagascar, making it possible to enter the country by bus or car from these neighboring countries.

For travelers planning to enter Mozambique by land, there are several overland entry points, including the Ressano Garcia border crossing with South Africa, the Namaacha border crossing with Eswatini, and the Milange border crossing with Malawi. It is essential to note that border crossings can be time-consuming, and it is recommended to research the required documents and procedures before attempting to cross the border. Additionally, some border crossings may be closed due to security concerns or other factors, so it is crucial to stay informed about the current situation before traveling.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Mozambique has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities, including Maputo, Beira, Nampula, and Pemba. The main domestic airlines are **LAM Mozambique Airlines** and **Fastjet Mozambique**, which offer flights to various destinations within the country. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices tend to increase closer to the departure date. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and airline. It is also possible to book flights through local travel agencies or at the airport, but online booking is generally more convenient and offers more options.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Mozambique's rail network is limited, with only a few routes operating, including the **Maputo-Johannesburg** route, which connects the capital city to South Africa. The rail network is primarily used for freight transportation, and passenger services are limited. There are no high-speed rail options available in Mozambique, and trains are generally slow and not very frequent. Booking train tickets can be done at the train station or through local travel agencies, but it is recommended to book in advance, especially for long-distance trips.
