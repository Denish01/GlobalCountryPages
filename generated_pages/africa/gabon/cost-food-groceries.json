The high cost of transportation, storage, and distribution also contributes to the increased prices. However, the local eating-out culture is prevalent, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a variety of traditional dishes at affordable prices. Home cooking is also a common practice, with many households preparing meals using fresh ingredients from local markets. The inflation rate of 1.2% in 2024 has a minimal impact on food prices, but the overall cost of living in Gabon remains relatively high.\n\nThe eating-out culture in Gabon is influenced by the country's French colonial history, with many restaurants serving a mix of French and African cuisine. The local cuisine is also shaped by the availability of fresh seafood, meat, and produce, with popular dishes such as **Poulet Nyembwe** (chicken with peanuts) and **Liboke** (steamed fish in banana leaves). The high cost of food in Gabon is also driven by the limited availability of certain ingredients, which are often imported from other countries. As a result, eating out at mid-range restaurants or preparing meals at home using local ingredients can be a more affordable option.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 1,350 XAF | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | 800 XAF | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 1,000 XAF | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 650 XAF | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 3,200 XAF | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $8.00 | 4,300 XAF | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $4.00 | 2,200 XAF | Imported from Europe |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 800 XAF | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.20 | 650 XAF | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00 | 550 XAF | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 4,300 XAF | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 550 XAF | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (typical dishes such as **Poulet Nyembwe**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$40 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Gabon can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional ingredients at lower prices. However, the quality and availability of products can vary greatly at local markets. It is recommended to buy fresh produce, meat, and seafood at local markets, while opting for supermarkets for imported goods and packaged products.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be substantial, with some products costing up to 50% more at supermarkets. However, supermarkets often offer a more convenient shopping experience, with a wider range of products and easier payment options. Local markets, on the other hand, require more time and effort, with customers needing to bargain and negotiate prices. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and customers can often expect to pay 10-20% less than the initial price quoted by the vendor.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Gabon is to opt for street food or local eateries, which offer traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- Local staples such as **Poulet Nyembwe**, **Liboke**, and **Mafé** (peanut stew) are good value and delicious.\n- Fresh produce, meat, and seafood are widely available at local markets and offer good value.\n- Imported products, such as apples and cheese, are often expensive and can be avoided in favor of local alternatives.\n- Eating at mid-range restaurants or preparing meals at home using local ingredients can be a more affordable option than fine dining or relying on imported goods.\n- It is recommended to try local fruits, such as mangoes and pineapples, which are abundant and affordable during the peak season.",
