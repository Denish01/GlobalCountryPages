[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Gabon's housing market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional housing, with a high demand for rental properties in urban areas, particularly in the capital city of Libreville. The rental market is relatively competitive, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months, and deposit requirements usually equivalent to 1-2 months' rent. Tenants in Gabon have some rights, including the right to a written lease agreement and protection against unfair eviction, but these rights are not always enforced. Compared to its regional neighbors, Gabon's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center, but the country's strong economy and high standard of living contribute to a relatively high demand for housing.

In terms of regional comparisons, Gabon's housing costs are higher than those in neighboring Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, but lower than those in the Republic of Congo. The country's unique blend of French and African influences, as well as its stunning natural beauty, make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists, which in turn drives up housing costs. However, outside of the city center, housing costs can be more affordable, and the country's relatively low inflation rate of 1.2% helps to keep costs stable.
