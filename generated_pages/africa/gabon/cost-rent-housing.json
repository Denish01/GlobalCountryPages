The rental market is relatively competitive, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months, and deposit requirements usually equivalent to 1-2 months' rent. Tenants in Gabon have some rights, including the right to a written lease agreement and protection against unfair eviction, but these rights are not always enforced. Compared to its regional neighbors, Gabon's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center, but the country's strong economy and high standard of living contribute to a relatively high demand for housing.\n\nIn terms of regional comparisons, Gabon's housing costs are higher than those in neighboring Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, but lower than those in the Republic of Congo. The country's unique blend of French and African influences, as well as its stunning natural beauty, make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists, which in turn drives up housing costs. However, outside of the city center, housing costs can be more affordable, and the country's relatively low inflation rate of 1.2% helps to keep costs stable.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $500-$800 | $300-$500 | small, basic accommodations |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,000 | $800-$1,200 | family size, amenities like pool or gym |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$3,000 | $1,200-$1,800 | spacious, luxurious finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$4,000 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | residential areas, family homes |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | traditional villages, basic amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Owendo**: a coastal neighborhood with modern apartments and stunning ocean views, rent range $800-$1,200 per month\n- **Glass**: a trendy neighborhood with a mix of modern and traditional housing, rent range $600-$1,000 per month\n- **Mont-Bouet**: a family-friendly neighborhood with spacious homes and a relaxed atmosphere, rent range $400-$800 per month\n- **Nkembo**: a vibrant neighborhood with a mix of African and French influences, rent range $500-$900 per month\n- **Louis**: a historic neighborhood with colonial-era architecture and a charming atmosphere, rent range $600-$1,200 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Gabon [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a reliable landlord and a well-maintained property\n- Be prepared to negotiate rent and lease terms, and don't be afraid to walk away if the deal isn't right\n- Be aware of scams, such as fake rental listings or dishonest landlords, and always inspect a property before signing a lease\n- Utilities are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are common in Gabon, but unfurnished options are also available, so clarify the terms with your landlord before signing a lease\n- Consider hiring a local guide or using online resources to find housing, as the rental market can be complex and challenging to navigate for foreigners.",
