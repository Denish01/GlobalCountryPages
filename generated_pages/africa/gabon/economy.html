        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Gabon's economy is classified as an upper-middle-income economy, driven primarily by its abundant natural resources, particularly oil, timber, and minerals. The country has a relatively small population of 2.4 million people, with a GDP per capita of $7,440, indicating a moderate level of economic development. Gabon's economy has been growing steadily over the years, with a focus on diversifying its economy and reducing its dependence on oil exports. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote economic development, including investing in infrastructure, encouraging foreign investment, and promoting the growth of the private sector.</p>

However, Gabon's economy still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate, a lack of economic diversification, and a dependence on imported goods. The government has recognized these challenges and is working to address them through various economic development strategies.</p>
