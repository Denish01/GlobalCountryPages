The system is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with 10 years of compulsory education. Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, which often have better facilities and more qualified teachers. However, there are also international schools available in major cities like Libreville, which offer a more diverse curriculum and are often preferred by expats.\n\nThe quality of education in Gabon is generally considered to be below the regional average, with limited resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. However, the government has been making efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing new programs to improve teacher training and student outcomes. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British curriculum.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and infrastructure |\n| Private Primary | $500-$1,500 | Range of quality and facilities |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and infrastructure |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$3,000 | Range of quality and facilities |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | Curriculum types include IB, British, and French |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs and resources |\n| Private University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of quality and programs |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Omar Bongo University is a top-ranked institution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability and quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Range of quality and subjects |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$200 | French and other languages available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies and materials |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Gabon are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and are generally of higher quality than public schools.\n- Scholarship availability is limited in Gabon, but some universities and organizations offer scholarships to students who demonstrate academic excellence or financial need.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly available in Gabon, with some universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The education quality in Gabon is generally considered to be below the regional average, but there are efforts being made to improve the system.\n- Expats and international students should research schools and institutions carefully before making a decision, as the quality and cost can vary significantly.\n- **French language skills** are essential for navigating the education system in Gabon, as French is the primary language of instruction.",
