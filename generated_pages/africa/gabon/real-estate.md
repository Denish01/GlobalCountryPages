[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Gabon is relatively small and largely driven by the oil and gas industry, which has been the mainstay of the country's economy. The market has experienced fluctuations in recent years, with a slowdown in 2015-2016 due to the decline in oil prices. However, the market has been recovering since then, with a steady increase in property prices and rental yields. The urban areas, particularly Libreville and Port-Gentil, have seen significant development and investment in recent years, with many new residential and commercial projects being built. In contrast, the rural areas have limited infrastructure and amenities, making them less attractive to investors.

The current market conditions in Gabon are characterized by a shortage of high-quality residential and commercial properties, particularly in the urban areas. This has led to an increase in property prices and rental yields, making it an attractive market for investors. However, the market is also subject to fluctuations in the global oil prices, which can impact the demand for properties. The government has also been implementing policies to encourage investment in the property sector, including the creation of a new property tax regime and the establishment of a national housing fund.

The price trajectory of properties in Gabon has been steadily increasing over the years, with an average annual growth rate of 5-7%. The urban areas have seen the highest growth rates, with prices increasing by up to 10% per annum in some areas. The rural areas have seen slower growth rates, with prices increasing by around 2-3% per annum. The **rental yield** in Gabon is around 5%, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.
