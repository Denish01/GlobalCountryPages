[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Gabon are generally higher compared to the regional average, mainly due to the country's reliance on imports and limited domestic production. The high cost of transportation, storage, and distribution also contributes to the increased prices. However, the local eating-out culture is prevalent, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a variety of traditional dishes at affordable prices. Home cooking is also a common practice, with many households preparing meals using fresh ingredients from local markets. The inflation rate of 1.2% in 2024 has a minimal impact on food prices, but the overall cost of living in Gabon remains relatively high.

The eating-out culture in Gabon is influenced by the country's French colonial history, with many restaurants serving a mix of French and African cuisine. The local cuisine is also shaped by the availability of fresh seafood, meat, and produce, with popular dishes such as **Poulet Nyembwe** (chicken with peanuts) and **Liboke** (steamed fish in banana leaves). The high cost of food in Gabon is also driven by the limited availability of certain ingredients, which are often imported from other countries. As a result, eating out at mid-range restaurants or preparing meals at home using local ingredients can be a more affordable option.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Gabon can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional ingredients at lower prices. However, the quality and availability of products can vary greatly at local markets. It is recommended to buy fresh produce, meat, and seafood at local markets, while opting for supermarkets for imported goods and packaged products.

The price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be substantial, with some products costing up to 50% more at supermarkets. However, supermarkets often offer a more convenient shopping experience, with a wider range of products and easier payment options. Local markets, on the other hand, require more time and effort, with customers needing to bargain and negotiate prices. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and customers can often expect to pay 10-20% less than the initial price quoted by the vendor.
