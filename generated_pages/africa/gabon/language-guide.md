[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Gabon is a **multilingual** country with over 40 languages spoken, but French is the dominant language used in government, education, and business. The linguistic landscape is diverse, with regional dialects and minority languages spoken in different parts of the country. In the north, languages like **Fang** and **Bulu** are spoken, while in the south, **Myene** and **Punu** are more common. While many Gabonese people speak some French, English is not widely spoken, and visitors may find it challenging to communicate in English, especially outside of major cities like Libreville.

Despite the language barrier, Gabonese people are generally friendly and welcoming, and many are eager to practice their English skills with visitors. In larger cities, some people may speak some English, particularly in the tourism industry, but it's still a good idea to learn some basic French phrases to help navigate everyday situations. In rural areas, English is rarely spoken, and visitors may need to rely on **interpreters** or **translators** to communicate with locals.

Gabon's language policy is focused on promoting French as the official language, but there are also efforts to preserve and promote local languages and cultures. The government has implemented language education programs to teach local languages in schools, and there are also initiatives to promote Gabonese culture and traditions through language and literature.
