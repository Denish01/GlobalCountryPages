The country's GDP per capita PPP of $21,510 suggests a relatively high level of economic development, but the cost of living is still affected by the country's limited infrastructure and reliance on imports. A budget lifestyle in Gabon would allow for basic necessities, but would require careful planning and sacrifice. A mid-range lifestyle would provide more comfort and flexibility, while a comfortable lifestyle would offer a high level of luxury and convenience.\n\nThe cost of living in Gabon varies depending on the location, with the capital city of Libreville being the most expensive. Compared to neighboring countries, Gabon is more expensive than Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, but similar to the Republic of Congo. The country's economy is driven by the oil and gas industry, which has led to a high demand for skilled workers and a corresponding increase in the cost of living. However, the country's natural beauty and unique culture make it an attractive destination for tourists and expats, who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of living in Gabon.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 200 | 500 | 1,200 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 300 | 600 | 1,200 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 50 | 150 | 300 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 100 | 200 | 400 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 50 | 100 | 200 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 100 | 300 | 600 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 50 | 100 | 200 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 100 | 200 | 400 | |\n| **Total** | **1,200** | **2,500** | **4,500** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle in Gabon would require careful planning and sacrifice.

[/SECTION]\nGabon can be an affordable destination for certain types of travelers, such as digital nomads or retirees, who are looking for a unique and exotic experience. These travelers may be able to take advantage of the country's low cost of living outside of the city center, and may be able to find ways to reduce their expenses.
