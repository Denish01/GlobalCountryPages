[SECTION] How Gabon Is Divided [/SECTION]
Gabon is divided into 9 provinces, which are further divided into 50 departments and 6 communes. The provinces are Estuaire, Haut-Ogooué, Moyen-Ogooué, Ngounié, Nyanga, Ogooué-Ivindo, Ogooué-Lolo, Ogooué-Maritime, and Woleu-Ntem. Each province has its own capital and is governed by a governor appointed by the president. The provinces are responsible for providing local services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

The administrative structure of Gabon is designed to provide a balance between central government control and local autonomy. The provinces have a significant degree of autonomy, allowing them to manage their own affairs and respond to local needs. However, the central government still plays a significant role in providing funding and oversight. This structure has helped to promote development and stability in the country, and has allowed Gabon to make significant progress in areas such as healthcare and education.
