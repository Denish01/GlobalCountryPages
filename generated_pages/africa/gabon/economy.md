The country has a relatively small population of 2.4 million people, with a GDP per capita of $7,440, indicating a moderate level of economic development. Gabon's economy has been growing steadily over the years, with a focus on diversifying its economy and reducing its dependence on oil exports. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote economic development, including investing in infrastructure, encouraging foreign investment, and promoting the growth of the private sector.

Gabon's economic trajectory has been influenced by its history as a former French colony, with the country still maintaining strong economic ties with France.

The government has recognized these challenges and is working to address them through various economic development strategies.

Despite these challenges, Gabon's economy has significant potential for growth, driven by its rich natural resources, strategic location, and favorable business environment. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing various reforms to improve the business climate and attract foreign investment.
