[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Gabon's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. Public healthcare facilities are generally less expensive but often lack the quality and resources of private facilities, which are more commonly used by foreigners and wealthy locals. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and expats usually opt for private healthcare due to its higher quality and better equipment. Having health insurance is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the high costs of private healthcare.

The healthcare system in Gabon is not universal, and many people rely on out-of-pocket payments or private insurance to access healthcare services. The government has been working to improve the public healthcare system, but it still faces significant challenges, including a lack of resources, equipment, and trained healthcare professionals. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer better quality care but are often expensive and out of reach for many locals.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number 1300 or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but they may not always be reliable or promptly available. The best hospitals for foreigners are usually private hospitals, which offer better quality care and equipment. Some of the best private hospitals in Gabon include the **Centre Hospitalier de Libreville** and the **Clinique des Caraïbes**. It is crucial to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including having a reliable means of transportation and access to emergency funds.

In case of an emergency, it is recommended to contact your insurance provider or embassy for assistance. Many private hospitals have agreements with international insurance providers, making it easier to access care. However, it is essential to note that emergency care can be expensive, and having adequate insurance coverage can help mitigate these costs. It is also a good idea to research the best hospitals and emergency services in your area before an emergency arises, to ensure that you can access the best possible care. [CALLOUT] Always keep emergency contact numbers handy and have a plan in place for emergency situations.
