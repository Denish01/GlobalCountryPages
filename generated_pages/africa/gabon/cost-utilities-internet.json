  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Gabon can range from $150 to $300 per month for a medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and service providers. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($50 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: XAF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nGabon's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with access to electricity, water, and gas available in most urban areas. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location and provider. The costs of utilities in Gabon are generally stable, but can fluctuate due to seasonal variations in demand and supply. For example, during the dry season, the cost of water and electricity may increase due to higher demand and reduced supply. In contrast, during the rainy season, the cost of these utilities may decrease due to lower demand and increased supply.\n\nThe government of Gabon has implemented measures to regulate the cost of utilities and ensure that they remain affordable for the population. However, the cost of utilities can still be a significant burden for many households, particularly those in rural areas where access to these services may be limited. To mitigate this, the government has introduced subsidies and other forms of assistance to help low-income households pay for their utility bills.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$140** | **$200** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Gabon Telecom, Moov |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 100 Mbps | Gabon Telecom, Moov |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Airtel, MTN |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Airtel, MTN |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Gabon Telecom, Moov |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Gabon, it is recommended to contact the service providers directly, such as Gabon Telecom or Moov, to arrange for installation and connection.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely available in Gabon, and can be a convenient option for households that want to manage their energy consumption and costs.\n- For internet services, Gabon Telecom and Moov are two of the main providers, offering a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transport or carpooling to reduce fuel consumption.\n- It is also a good idea to regularly review and compare utility plans and providers to ensure that you are getting the best value for your money.",
