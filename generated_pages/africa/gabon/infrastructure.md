[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Gabon's infrastructure development has been steadily improving over the years, with a focus on upgrading its transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications. The government has invested heavily in recent years to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on modernizing its roads, ports, and airports. However, despite these efforts, there is still a significant gap in infrastructure development between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and healthcare. The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its vast territory and low population density, making it challenging to provide services to remote areas.

Gabon's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location in Central Africa, with the country serving as a key transit point for trade between the region and the rest of the world. The country's ports and airports are being upgraded to handle increased trade volumes, and its roads are being improved to facilitate the transportation of goods and people. However, the country still faces significant challenges in developing its infrastructure, including a lack of funding, corruption, and a shortage of skilled labor.

The government has also launched several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a new transportation master plan and the creation of a national infrastructure fund. These initiatives aim to improve the country's infrastructure and promote economic growth and development. However, the implementation of these initiatives is often hindered by bureaucratic delays, corruption, and a lack of funding.
