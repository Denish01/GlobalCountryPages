[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Gabon's healthcare system is structured around a network of public hospitals, health centers, and private clinics, with a mix of French and African influences. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, but the quality of care can be inconsistent, with better-equipped facilities and more qualified staff found in urban areas like Libreville. In contrast, rural areas often struggle with limited resources, outdated equipment, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. Despite these challenges, Gabon has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in infant mortality rates, life expectancy, and the control of infectious diseases like malaria and HIV/AIDS.

The quality of care in Gabon's healthcare system is a major concern, particularly in rural areas where facilities and staff may be limited. However, in urban areas like Libreville, there are several well-equipped hospitals and clinics that offer a higher standard of care. **Universal healthcare** is not available to all citizens, and those who can afford it often opt for private health insurance or seek medical care abroad. The government has implemented initiatives to increase access to healthcare, including the introduction of **community-based health insurance** schemes, but more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality.

Gabon's healthcare system faces numerous challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, the country has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes, and there are opportunities for improvement, particularly through investment in healthcare infrastructure and the development of **public-private partnerships**. The government has also launched initiatives to promote **health education** and **disease prevention**, which are critical to reducing the burden of infectious diseases and improving overall health outcomes.
