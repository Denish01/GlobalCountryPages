[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Gabon is divided into three branches: the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial**. The President, who is both the head of state and head of government, is elected by popular vote for a seven-year term. The President has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the Prime Minister, dissolve the National Assembly, and sign bills into law. The **separation of powers** is established by the Constitution, which provides for an independent judiciary and a legislature that can check the power of the executive. Gabon has a **unitary system**, with a centralized government in Libreville that has authority over the entire country.

The **Constitution** of Gabon, adopted in 1991, provides the framework for the government and the relationship between the different branches. It establishes the principles of **democracy**, **human rights**, and the **rule of law**, and provides for the protection of individual freedoms and the promotion of social justice. The Constitution also provides for the **independence of the judiciary**, which is essential for ensuring the **impartiality** and **fairness** of the legal system.

The **political system** in Gabon is characterized by a mix of **presidential** and **parliamentary** elements. The President has significant powers, but the National Assembly and Senate also play important roles in the legislative process. The **opposition** parties have a significant presence in the National Assembly, which provides a check on the power of the ruling party. However, the **dominant party system** in Gabon, where the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) has been in power since 1968, has raised concerns about the **lack of political competition** and the **limited space for opposition**.
