[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Gabon's population is relatively small compared to other African countries, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 2.1%, which is slightly higher than the global average. The country's urban population is significant, with about 87.2% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Libreville and other major cities like Port-Gentil and Franceville. This urbanization trend is driven by economic opportunities, improved access to education and healthcare, and the desire for a better quality of life. Gabon has also experienced migration patterns, with many citizens moving to urban areas in search of work, while others have emigrated to countries like France and other European nations in search of economic opportunities.

The population of Gabon is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 20.7 years. This demographic profile presents both opportunities and challenges for the country, as a large youth population can drive economic growth and innovation, but it also requires significant investments in education, healthcare, and job creation. Gabon's population density is relatively low, with an average of 9.2 people per square kilometer, which is much lower than the global average. This low population density is due to the country's large geographic area and the fact that much of the population is concentrated in urban areas.

Gabon's life expectancy at birth is approximately 66.5 years, which is slightly higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The fertility rate is around 3.8 children per woman, which is higher than the global average. These demographic trends have significant implications for Gabon's social and economic development, as a growing population requires increased investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
