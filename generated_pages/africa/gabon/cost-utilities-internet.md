[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Gabon's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with access to electricity, water, and gas available in most urban areas. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location and provider. The costs of utilities in Gabon are generally stable, but can fluctuate due to seasonal variations in demand and supply. For example, during the dry season, the cost of water and electricity may increase due to higher demand and reduced supply. In contrast, during the rainy season, the cost of these utilities may decrease due to lower demand and increased supply.

The government of Gabon has implemented measures to regulate the cost of utilities and ensure that they remain affordable for the population. However, the cost of utilities can still be a significant burden for many households, particularly those in rural areas where access to these services may be limited. To mitigate this, the government has introduced subsidies and other forms of assistance to help low-income households pay for their utility bills.
