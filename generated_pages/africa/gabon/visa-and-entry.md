# Gabon Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Gabon before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Gabon has a moderate visa policy, requiring visitors from many countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. However, citizens of certain countries are eligible for visa-free access or can obtain a visa on arrival. Gabon's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel while ensuring national security and public health. The country offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, and student visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations.

Gabon's visa policy is not overly restrictive, but it does require visitors to meet certain criteria before entering the country. Citizens of around 20 countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, are eligible for visa-free access, while citizens of other countries can obtain a visa on arrival or through the e-visa system. The e-visa system, introduced in 2015, has made it easier for visitors to obtain a visa and has helped to increase tourism in the country.
