[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Gabon is primarily French-based, with French being the language of instruction. The system is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with 10 years of compulsory education. Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, which often have better facilities and more qualified teachers. However, there are also international schools available in major cities like Libreville, which offer a more diverse curriculum and are often preferred by expats.

The quality of education in Gabon is generally considered to be below the regional average, with limited resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. However, the government has been making efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing new programs to improve teacher training and student outcomes. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British curriculum.
