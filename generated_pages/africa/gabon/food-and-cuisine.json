Traditional Gabonese cuisine features a variety of dishes made with local ingredients such as cassava, plantains, peanuts, and fish, often cooked in palm oil and flavored with spices and herbs. French cuisine has also had a significant impact on Gabonese cooking, with many dishes featuring French ingredients and cooking techniques.\n\nThe cuisine in Gabon varies by region, with different ethnic groups and geographic areas having their own unique specialties and ingredients. In the coastal regions, seafood is a staple, with dishes such as **Poulet Nyembwe** and **Liboke** featuring fresh fish and shellfish. In the interior regions, meat and vegetables are more common, with dishes such as **Saka-Saka**, a stew made with meat or fish, vegetables, and peanuts. Gabon's cuisine is also influenced by its neighboring countries, with dishes such as **Mafé**, a rich meat stew, and **Foutou**, a dish made with boiled and pounded cassava or plantains, being popular in the country.\n\nGabon's food culture is also characterized by its strong social and communal aspects.
