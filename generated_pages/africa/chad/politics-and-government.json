The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to two terms. The National Assembly, the country's unicameral legislature, is composed of 188 members who are also directly elected by the people for four-year terms. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial, with a system of checks and balances to ensure that no one branch has too much power.\n\nThe **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Constitution, which provides for an independent judiciary and a legislative branch that is separate from the executive. However, in practice, the President has significant influence over the other branches of government, and the country's political system has been criticized for being overly **presidential**. Chad is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government that has authority over the entire country.\n\nThe government's **decision-making process** is often opaque, and the country's **bureaucracy** can be slow and inefficient.
