        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Chad's economy is classified as a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $640. The country has a developing economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, mining, and services. The economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, driven by investments in the oil and mining sectors. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to education and healthcare, and a high poverty rate.
