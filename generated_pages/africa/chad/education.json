  "content": "The education system in Chad is characterized by a mix of public and private institutions, with a strong emphasis on primary education, although the country still faces significant challenges in terms of access, quality, and funding.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 41.4%\nSchool System: 9 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: French\nAcademic Calendar: October to July\nInternational Schools: limited\nTop University Ranking: 401-500 globally for the University of N'Djamena\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Chad is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory, lasts for six years and is followed by three years of lower secondary education. Upper secondary education, which is not compulsory, lasts for two years and leads to a baccalaureate diploma. The quality of education in Chad varies significantly, with public schools often facing challenges such as overcrowding, lack of resources, and poorly trained teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to offer better facilities and more qualified teachers, but are often expensive and inaccessible to many Chadians.\n\nThe public education system in Chad is free, but many families still struggle to afford the costs of uniforms, books, and other supplies. As a result, many children, particularly in rural areas, do not attend school or drop out at an early age. The government has been working to improve the education system, including increasing access to primary education and improving teacher training. However, significant challenges remain, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are some positive trends in the education system in Chad. For example, the country has made significant progress in increasing access to primary education, particularly for girls. Additionally, the government has introduced initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teacher training programs.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
