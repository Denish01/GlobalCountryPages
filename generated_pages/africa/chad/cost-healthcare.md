[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Chad's healthcare system is mixed, with both public and private facilities available, although the quality of care can vary significantly between the two. Public healthcare facilities are generally underfunded and understaffed, often lacking basic medical supplies and equipment, whereas private facilities tend to offer better quality care but at a higher cost. For locals, the healthcare system can be challenging to navigate, with long wait times and limited access to specialized care. For foreigners, it is recommended to use private facilities, which may offer more comprehensive care and better amenities, but at a higher cost.

The need for health insurance in Chad is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as the cost of medical care can be high and the quality of public facilities may not be up to international standards. Many private facilities require payment upfront, and having insurance can help alleviate the financial burden of medical expenses. Additionally, some insurance plans may offer coverage for evacuation to a nearby country with better medical facilities, which can be a lifesaver in emergency situations.
