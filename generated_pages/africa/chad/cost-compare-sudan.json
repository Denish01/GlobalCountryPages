Chad's economy is largely driven by its oil and agriculture sectors, while Sudan's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and services. In terms of cost of living, Sudan is generally cheaper than Chad, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Chad's economy has been growing steadily in recent years, which has led to an increase in prices for certain goods and services.\n\nThe main difference in cost of living between Chad and Sudan is due to the significant difference in their GDP per capita, with Sudan having a higher GDP per capita. This has resulted in Sudan having a more developed economy and a higher standard of living. However, Chad's cost of living is still relatively high compared to other African countries, due to its landlocked location and limited infrastructure.
