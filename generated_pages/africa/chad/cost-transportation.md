[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Chad's transportation system is relatively underdeveloped, with limited public transportation options available in major cities like N'Djamena. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowded and unreliable buses and minibuses being the primary mode of transportation for most people. However, in recent years, the government has made efforts to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of ride-hailing services. Most people in Chad get around by using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are affordable and widely available, but often overcrowded and lacking in safety features.

The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in Chad makes it difficult for people to get around, especially in rural areas where roads are often in poor condition. However, the use of **motorcycles** and **bicycles** is becoming increasingly popular, especially among young people, as a convenient and affordable mode of transportation. Additionally, the government has introduced initiatives to promote the use of **non-motorized transportation**, such as walking and cycling, in urban areas to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.
