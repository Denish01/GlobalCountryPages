[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Chad's food prices are influenced by various factors, including the country's landlocked location, limited agricultural production, and reliance on imports. The inflation rate of 8.9% in 2024 also contributes to the high cost of living, making it challenging for locals and expatriates to afford basic necessities. In general, eating out is not a common practice in Chad, and most people prefer to cook at home due to the high costs associated with dining out. However, for those who do eat out, there are various options available, ranging from inexpensive local eateries to mid-range restaurants serving international cuisine.

The high cost of food in Chad is also driven by the limited availability of certain products, particularly fresh produce, which is often imported from neighboring countries. As a result, prices for fruits and vegetables can be quite high, especially during peak seasons. Furthermore, the lack of a well-developed agricultural sector and limited infrastructure contribute to the high transportation costs, which are then passed on to consumers. Despite these challenges, there are still affordable options available for those who are willing to explore local markets and cook at home.
