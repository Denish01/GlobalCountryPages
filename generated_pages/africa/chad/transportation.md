[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Chad is accessible by air, with the main international airport being N'Djamena International Airport (NDJ), which receives flights from major African and European cities. Direct flights are available from hubs such as Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul, and overland entry points exist along the borders with neighboring countries, including Libya, Sudan, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Niger. However, overland travel can be difficult and time-consuming due to the poor road conditions and potential security risks.

The main entry points for overland travel are the border crossings with Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and Sudan, although the security situation in these areas can be unstable. It is essential to research the current situation and plan carefully before attempting to enter Chad by land. Additionally, visitors should ensure they have all the necessary visas and documents before arriving in the country.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in Chad are limited, with only a few airlines operating within the country. The main domestic airline is **Tchadia Airlines**, which offers flights between N'Djamena and other major cities such as Sarh, Moundou, and Abéché. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, and it is recommended to do so in advance to secure a seat. The cost of domestic flights can vary depending on the route and time of year, but approximate costs range from $100 to $300 for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Chad does not have a rail network, making train travel impossible within the country. The lack of a rail system limits the transportation options for both people and goods, and the country relies heavily on road and air transport.
