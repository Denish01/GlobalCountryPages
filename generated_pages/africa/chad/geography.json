It shares borders with six countries: Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west. Chad is positioned in a strategic location, with the Sahara Desert covering much of its northern territory and the Sahel region in the south. The country's geographical position has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy.\n\nChad's borders stretch for approximately 6,000 kilometers, with the country's terrain varying greatly from north to south. The northern part of the country is characterized by arid desert landscapes, while the southern region is more fertile and home to several rivers, including the Chari and Logone rivers. The country's capital, N'Djamena, is located in the southwestern part of the country, near the confluence of the Chari and Logone rivers. The city serves as a major transportation hub and commercial center, connecting Chad to neighboring countries and the rest of the world.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nChad's terrain is diverse, with several distinct regions that reflect the country's geographic and climatic conditions. The Saharan Desert covers much of the northern part of the country, with sand dunes, oases, and rocky outcrops dominating the landscape. The Ennedi Desert, located in the northeastern part of the country, is a particularly notable region, known for its stunning rock formations and unique wildlife. In contrast, the southern part of the country is more fertile, with savannas, grasslands, and tropical forests covering much of the region.\n\nThe country's mountainous regions are located in the north, with the Tibesti Mountains being the most prominent range. The Tibesti Mountains are home to Emi Koussi, Chad's highest peak, which rises to an elevation of 3,445 meters. The mountains are also home to several volcanic peaks, including Emi Koussi, which is a dormant volcano. The region is sparsely populated, with several nomadic tribes inhabiting the area. The southern part of the country is also home to several rivers, including the Chari and Logone rivers, which flow into Lake Chad, a large freshwater lake that straddles the border between Chad, Nigeria, and Cameroon.\n\nThe country's landscape has been shaped by its geological history, with the Sahara Desert expanding and contracting over the centuries. The region's unique geology has also created several natural wonders, including the Guelta d'Archei, a natural rock formation that is home to a large population of crocodiles. The country's diverse terrain and landscape support a wide range of flora and fauna, with several national parks and protected areas established to conserve the country's natural heritage.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter | December to February | 15-25°C | low | cool and dry |\n| Spring | March to May | 25-35°C | moderate | hot and dry |\n| Summer | June to August | 30-40°C | high | hot and humid |\n| Autumn | September to November | 25-35°C | moderate | hot and dry |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: November to February.
