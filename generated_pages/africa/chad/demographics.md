[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Chad's population size is significant in the context of its vast territory, which spans over 1.2 million square kilometers. The population has been growing steadily, with an average annual growth rate of 3.2%, driven by a high fertility rate and improvements in healthcare. However, this growth also poses challenges, such as pressure on natural resources, infrastructure, and social services. The urban population is relatively small, with approximately 23% of the population living in cities, while the majority reside in rural areas. Migration patterns in Chad are influenced by economic opportunities, with many people moving to urban centers or neighboring countries in search of work.

The population of Chad is also affected by environmental factors, such as droughts and desertification, which can lead to displacement and migration. Additionally, the country's location in the Sahel region makes it vulnerable to climate change, which can have significant impacts on agriculture, livestock, and human settlement. Despite these challenges, Chad's population is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that it will reach 30 million by 2030.

Chad's population growth has significant implications for the country's development, including the need for increased investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The government has implemented policies aimed at reducing population growth, such as family planning programs and education initiatives, but more needs to be done to address the challenges posed by rapid population growth.
