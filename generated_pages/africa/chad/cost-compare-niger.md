[SECTION] Overview: Chad vs Niger [/SECTION]
Chad and Niger are two neighboring countries in West Africa, both with unique economic contexts and cost of living profiles. Chad has a relatively higher GDP per capita and a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on oil production, while Niger's economy is primarily driven by agriculture. In terms of cost of living, Chad tends to be cheaper than Niger, particularly when it comes to housing and food. However, Niger's cost of living can vary greatly depending on the region, with urban areas like Niamey tend to be more expensive than rural areas.

The overall cost of living difference between Chad and Niger is around 15-20%, with Chad being the cheaper option. This is largely due to the fact that Chad has a more developed economy and a stronger currency, which makes imports and goods relatively cheaper. Additionally, Chad's capital city, N'Djamena, has a more established expat community and a wider range of amenities and services, which can make it easier for foreigners to find affordable housing and food options. In contrast, Niger's economy is more fragile, and the country faces significant development challenges, which can drive up the cost of living, particularly in urban areas.
