Public healthcare facilities are generally underfunded and understaffed, often lacking basic medical supplies and equipment, whereas private facilities tend to offer better quality care but at a higher cost. For locals, the healthcare system can be challenging to navigate, with long wait times and limited access to specialized care. For foreigners, it is recommended to use private facilities, which may offer more comprehensive care and better amenities, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe need for health insurance in Chad is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as the cost of medical care can be high and the quality of public facilities may not be up to international standards. Many private facilities require payment upfront, and having insurance can help alleviate the financial burden of medical expenses. Additionally, some insurance plans may offer coverage for evacuation to a nearby country with better medical facilities, which can be a lifesaver in emergency situations.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's experience |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Limited availability of specialists in public facilities |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | Private facilities may offer more comprehensive dental care |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-30 | Limited availability of eye care specialists in public facilities |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $20-50 | Prices vary by laboratory and test type |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-100 | Private facilities may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-500 | Prices vary by type of surgery and surgeon's experience |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-200 | Private facilities may offer more comprehensive maternity care |\n| MRI Scan | $100-300 | Limited availability of MRI machines in public facilities |\n| X-Ray | $10-50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Covers more comprehensive medical expenses, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Covers medical expenses, including evacuation to a nearby country with better medical facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** may require a doctor's prescription, and prices can vary by pharmacy and medication type.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available, but prices can vary by pharmacy and product.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is limited in rural areas, with most pharmacies located in urban centers.\n- **Common medication prices** can range from $5-20 for basic medications, such as pain relievers and antibiotics.\n- **Prescription rules** vary by medication type, with some requiring a doctor's prescription and others available over-the-counter.\n- **Medication quality** can vary by pharmacy and product, with some pharmacies offering higher-quality medications than others.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 17, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.
