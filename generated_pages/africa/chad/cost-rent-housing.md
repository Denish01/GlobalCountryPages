[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Chad is relatively underdeveloped, with a limited supply of modern apartments and houses, especially in the capital city of N'Djamena. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are not well-established, and renters often have to negotiate with landlords to resolve disputes. Compared to regional neighbors, Chad's housing costs are relatively high, especially in the city center, due to the limited supply of quality housing and the high demand from expats and diplomats. However, prices can vary greatly depending on the location, with areas outside the city center offering more affordable options.

The housing market in Chad is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the high inflation rate of 8.9% affecting the cost of living, including housing. Additionally, the limited access to healthcare and education, with a health expenditure per capita of $47 and an education spend of 3.2% of GDP, can impact the overall quality of life and the attractiveness of the country to expats and investors. Despite these challenges, Chad's housing market offers opportunities for investment and development, particularly in the city center, where demand for modern apartments and offices is high.
