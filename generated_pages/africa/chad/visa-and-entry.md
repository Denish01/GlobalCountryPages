# Chad Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Chad before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Chad has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa prior to arrival. However, a few countries are exempt from this requirement, and some nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival. Currently, only a handful of countries, including a few African nations, have visa-free access to Chad. The country's visa policy is designed to control the flow of visitors and ensure national security.

The Chadian government has introduced an e-visa system to facilitate the visa application process for tourists and business travelers. This online platform allows applicants to submit their visa applications and supporting documents electronically, reducing the need for in-person visits to the embassy or consulate. Despite these efforts, the visa application process can still be lengthy and requires careful planning.
