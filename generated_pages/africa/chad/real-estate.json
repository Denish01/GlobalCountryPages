The market is driven by demand for residential and commercial properties in urban areas, particularly in the capital city N'Djamena. Current market conditions are marked by a shortage of modern housing and office spaces, leading to high rents and prices. The price trajectory is upward, driven by increasing demand and limited supply. Urban areas are more developed than rural areas, with better access to amenities and services.\n\nThe property market in Chad is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including its dependence on oil exports and its vulnerability to external shocks. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented policies to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth, including the creation of free trade zones and the simplification of business registration procedures. These initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on the property market, particularly in the commercial sector.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is significant in Chad, with urban areas accounting for a small proportion of the population. However, urbanization is increasing, driven by migration from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. This trend is expected to continue, driving demand for housing and other types of properties in urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| N'Djamena | 200 | 500 | Apartment |\n| Moundou | 150 | 300 | House |\n| Sarh | 100 | 200 | Commercial |\n| Abéché | 80 | 150 | Residential |\n| Faya-Largeau | 60 | 100 | Rural |\n| Bongor | 50 | 80 | Mixed-use |\n| Mongo | 40 | 60 | Agricultural |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy properties in Chad, but they must obtain prior approval from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance.\n- Foreign companies can own properties, but they must be registered with the Chadian authorities and obtain a business license.\n- Foreigners can lease properties for up to 99 years, with the option to renew.\n- Foreigners must pay a registration fee and a stamp duty on property purchases.\n- Foreigners must also comply with Chadian tax laws and regulations, including paying property tax and income tax on rental income.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
