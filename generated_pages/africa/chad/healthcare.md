[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Chad's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. However, the quality of care is generally considered basic, and there are significant disparities between urban and rural areas. In urban areas, such as the capital N'Djamena, there are more healthcare facilities and a greater number of trained healthcare professionals, while rural areas often lack access to even basic medical care. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading many to seek care from private providers, which can be expensive and out of reach for many Chadians.

The **Ministry of Public Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system in Chad, including regulating healthcare providers, setting healthcare policies, and coordinating healthcare services. Despite efforts to improve the healthcare system, Chad still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to medical supplies and equipment. As a result, many Chadians rely on traditional medicine or travel to neighboring countries for medical care.

Chad has made some progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including increasing access to **vaccinations** and **maternal healthcare**. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant health challenges facing the country, including high rates of **malaria**, **tuberculosis**, and **HIV/AIDS**.
