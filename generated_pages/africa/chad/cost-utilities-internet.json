  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Chad can vary significantly depending on factors such as location, usage, and provider, with a typical monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment ranging from $100 to $200 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($150 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($80 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.20 per kWh)\nCurrency: XAF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nChad's utility infrastructure is still developing, and the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location. In urban areas such as N'Djamena, the capital city, utilities like electricity and water are generally more reliable, but can still be subject to outages and disruptions. In rural areas, access to basic utilities is often limited, and costs can be higher due to the lack of infrastructure and competition. The costs of utilities in Chad are also subject to fluctuation due to factors such as inflation, which was 8.9% in 2024, and seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity during the hot summer months.\n\nThe Chadian government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including investments in renewable energy sources and upgrades to the national grid. However, the country still faces significant challenges in providing reliable and affordable utility services to its population. As a result, many households and businesses rely on alternative sources of energy, such as generators and solar panels, which can be expensive to purchase and maintain. Additionally, the lack of competition in the utility market can lead to higher prices and limited options for consumers.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | (bottled gas) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$140** | **$205** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Sotel, Moov |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 100 Mbps | Sotel, Moov |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Tigo, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | Tigo, Airtel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Sotel, Moov |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | (available in some areas) |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | (available in some areas) |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Canal+ Afrique) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Chad, it is recommended to contact the local providers, such as Sotel or Moov, and provide the necessary documentation, including a copy of your passport and a proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely available and can be a convenient option for households and businesses, but may not offer the best value for heavy users.\n- The best internet providers in Chad are Sotel and Moov, which offer a range of plans and speeds, including fiber internet and mobile data.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and consider using alternative sources of energy, such as solar panels.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts or bundles.",
