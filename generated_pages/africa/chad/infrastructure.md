# Chad Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Chad's infrastructure is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in road networks, energy access, and telecommunications, although recent investments have aimed to improve the situation.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 8% of population
Internet Penetration: 5%
Road Network: 40,000 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 5
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Chad's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other African countries. The country faces significant challenges in providing basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation to its population. Recent investments have focused on improving the road network, expanding energy access, and developing the telecommunications sector. However, the urban-rural gap remains significant, with most infrastructure development concentrated in the capital city, N'Djamena, and other urban areas. Rural areas often lack access to basic services, and the road network is largely unpaved and in poor condition.

The government has launched several initiatives to improve the infrastructure landscape, including the development of a national infrastructure plan and the creation of a public-private partnership framework to attract foreign investment. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including a lack of funding, limited institutional capacity, and a harsh climate that makes construction and maintenance difficult.

Chad's infrastructure development is also hindered by its landlocked location, which increases the cost of transporting goods and people. The country relies on neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Nigeria, for access to seaports, which can lead to delays and increased costs. To address this challenge, the government has explored alternative transportation options, including the development of a rail network and the expansion of the country's airport infrastructure.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- Chad's power generation is primarily based on **thermal energy**, with a limited contribution from **renewable energy sources** such as solar and wind power.
- The country's energy sector is characterized by frequent **power outages** and a lack of access to electricity, particularly in rural areas.
- The government has launched initiatives to increase **energy access**, including the development of off-grid solar systems and the expansion of the national grid.
- **Renewable energy** is becoming an increasingly important part of Chad's energy mix, with several solar and wind power projects under development.
- The country's **energy infrastructure** is in need of upgrading, with a focus on improving the efficiency and reliability of the national grid.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water safety** is a concern in Chad, with many households relying on untreated water sources such as wells and rivers.
- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with many households lacking access to improved sanitation facilities such as toilets and latrines.
- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on traditional water sources such as wells and boreholes.
- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water and sanitation services**, including the development of new water treatment plants and the expansion of sanitation infrastructure.
- **Hygiene education** is also an important aspect of Chad's water and sanitation strategy, with a focus on promoting good hygiene practices and reducing the risk of water-borne diseases.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread in Chad, with several mobile network operators providing services across the country.
- **Fiber optic** networks are being developed to improve **broadband** access, particularly in urban areas.
- The government has launched initiatives to expand **4G/5G** services, with a focus on improving mobile internet access and promoting digital inclusion.
- **Postal services** are limited in Chad, with a focus on traditional mail services rather than modern logistics and courier services.
- **Internet penetration** is relatively low in Chad, with a focus on increasing access to internet services, particularly in rural areas.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The **Trans-Saharan Highway** project aims to improve road connectivity between Chad and neighboring countries, with a focus on promoting regional trade and economic development.
- The **N'Djamena Water Supply** project aims to improve access to safe drinking water in the capital city, with a focus on reducing the risk of water-borne diseases.
- The **Chad-Cameroon Pipeline** project aims to improve energy access and promote economic development in the region, with a focus on transporting oil from Chad to Cameroon.
- The **World Bank's Infrastructure Development Project** aims to improve Chad's infrastructure landscape, with a focus on developing the country's road network, energy sector, and telecommunications infrastructure.
- The **European Union's Development Fund** has provided funding for several infrastructure development projects in Chad, including the development of a new airport and the expansion of the country's energy sector.
