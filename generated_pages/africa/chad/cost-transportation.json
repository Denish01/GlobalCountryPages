The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowded and unreliable buses and minibuses being the primary mode of transportation for most people. However, in recent years, the government has made efforts to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of ride-hailing services. Most people in Chad get around by using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are affordable and widely available, but often overcrowded and lacking in safety features.\n\nThe lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in Chad makes it difficult for people to get around, especially in rural areas where roads are often in poor condition. However, the use of **motorcycles** and **bicycles** is becoming increasingly popular, especially among young people, as a convenient and affordable mode of transportation. Additionally, the government has introduced initiatives to promote the use of **non-motorized transportation**, such as walking and cycling, in urban areas to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage, overcrowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Extensive network, but often overcrowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.00 | $1.00 | $5-$10 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.50 | $0.80 | $3-$6 | Bollore, Allo Taxi available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, fixed rate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mostly in urban areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited frequency, poor road conditions |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes, high prices |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are often cheaper than taking a taxi or renting a car.\n- When using ride-hailing apps, make sure to **negotiate the fare** before starting the journey to avoid any disputes.\n- Always **wear a helmet** when riding a motorcycle or bicycle, and be aware of the local traffic rules and regulations.\n- Be cautious when using **public transportation**, especially at night, and avoid carrying large amounts of cash or valuables.\n- Consider **renting a car** for long-distance travel, especially if you are traveling in a group, as it can be more cost-effective and convenient.\n- When **driving in Chad**, be aware of the poor road conditions and limited infrastructure, and always carry a **spare tire** and **emergency kit** with you.",
