The country has several domestic airports, including the N'Djamena International Airport, which offers flights to several regional destinations. There are also several bus companies that operate in the country, offering services between major cities and towns. However, the road network is often in poor condition, and driving can be challenging, especially during the rainy season. As a result, many people rely on motorcycles or bicycles to get around, especially in rural areas.\n\nFor visitors, the best way to get around Chad is often by private vehicle or taxi, as public transportation options can be limited and unpredictable. It is also recommended to hire a driver or guide, especially for long-distance travel, as they can help navigate the country's challenging roads and provide valuable insights into local culture and customs. Additionally, many tour operators offer guided tours and transportation services, which can be a convenient and safe way to explore the country.",
