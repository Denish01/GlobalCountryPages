[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nChad has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa prior to arrival. However, a few countries are exempt from this requirement, and some nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival. Currently, only a handful of countries, including a few African nations, have visa-free access to Chad. The country's visa policy is designed to control the flow of visitors and ensure national security.\n\nThe Chadian government has introduced an e-visa system to facilitate the visa application process for tourists and business travelers. This online platform allows applicants to submit their visa applications and supporting documents electronically, reducing the need for in-person visits to the embassy or consulate. Despite these efforts, the visa application process can still be lengthy and requires careful planning.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 90 days | Must apply at the embassy or consulate |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 90 days | Can apply for an e-visa |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 90 days | Some EU citizens can obtain a visa on arrival |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 90 days | Must apply at the embassy or consulate |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 90 days | Can apply for an e-visa |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 90 days | Must apply at the embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 90 days | Must apply at the embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** To visit Chad as a tourist, you will need to apply for a tourist visa, which is usually valid for a maximum stay of 90 days.
