The tax system in Malawi is administered by the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA), which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs, and excise duties. The MRA also provides guidance and support to taxpayers through its website, tax offices, and other channels. Taxpayers can also seek assistance from tax professionals and consultants who are registered with the MRA.
