The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people and serves a five-year term. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Assembly, which has 193 seats. Members of the National Assembly are also directly elected by the people and serve five-year terms. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court of Appeal and the High Court, which are responsible for interpreting the laws of the land.\n\nThe system of government in Malawi is designed to provide checks and balances among the three branches, ensuring that no one branch has too much power. The President has the power to appoint judges, ambassadors, and other high-ranking officials, but these appointments must be approved by the National Assembly. The National Assembly has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto them. The judicial branch has the power to declare laws and government actions unconstitutional.\n\nMalawi's political system is also characterized by a **multiparty system**, with several political parties competing for power. This has led to a vibrant and dynamic political landscape, with parties often forming alliances and coalitions to achieve their goals.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President Lazarus Chakwera | Head of state and government |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker Catherine Gotani Hara | Lawmaking body |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Appeal | Chief Justice Andrew Nyirenda | Highest court in the land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Malawi Congress Party (MCP) | Center-right | Lazarus Chakwera | 62 | Ruling party |\n| Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) | Center-left | Peter Mutharika | 59 | Main opposition party |\n| United Transformation Movement (UTM) | Center | Saulos Chilima | 21 | Junior partner in ruling coalition |\n| People's Party (PP) | Center | Joyce Banda | 5 | Former ruling party |\n| Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) | Center-left | Enoch Chihana | 1 | Small opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Malawi is based on a **first-past-the-post** system, where the candidate with the most votes wins the seat.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent presidential and parliamentary elections taking place in 2020.\n- The last election saw a **record turnout** of over 70% of registered voters, with President Lazarus Chakwera winning the presidential election.\n- The next election is scheduled to take place in 2025, with the electoral commission already beginning preparations.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Malawi's political climate is currently **stable**, with the ruling coalition enjoying a majority in the National Assembly.\n- However, the country faces several key challenges, including **poverty**, **corruption**, and **infrastructure development**.\n- Regional dynamics also play a role, with Malawi being a member of the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)** and the **African Union (AU)**.\n- The country's **freedom indices** are mixed, with Malawi ranking 64th out of 180 countries in the 2022 Press Freedom Index and 104th out of 180 countries in the 2022 Human Freedom Index.\n- The government has also faced **criticism** for its handling of **human rights** issues, including the use of force against protesters and the detention of opposition politicians.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Malawi is a member of several international organizations, including the **United Nations (UN)**, the **African Union (AU)**, and the **Commonwealth of Nations**.\n- The country has **diplomatic relations** with over 100 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and China.\n- Malawi has also been a **recipient of foreign aid**, with the country receiving significant assistance from the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** and the **World Bank**.\n- The country's **diplomatic stance** is generally **neutral**, with Malawi seeking to maintain good relations with all countries.\n- Malawi is also a member of the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)**, which aims to promote economic integration and cooperation among member states.",
