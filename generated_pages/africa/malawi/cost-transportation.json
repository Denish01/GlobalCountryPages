The main transportation modes in Malawi are buses, minibuses, and taxis, with most people relying on these modes to get around. The quality of public transit is generally good in urban areas, with frequent bus services connecting major cities and towns. However, in rural areas, public transportation is limited, and many people rely on walking or cycling to get around.\n\nIn urban areas, such as Lilongwe and Blantyre, the public transportation system is relatively well-developed, with a network of buses and minibuses connecting different parts of the city. The minibuses, also known as **matolas**, are a popular mode of transport, offering a cheap and convenient way to get around. However, the traffic in these cities can be chaotic, and the roads are often congested, making it essential to plan your journey in advance.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$20 | Good coverage in urban areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Malawi |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.20-$0.50 | N/A | Frequent services on main routes |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Malawi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3-$5 | $1-$2 | $5-$10 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$3 | $0.50-$1 | $5-$10 | Uber, Bolt available in Lilongwe and Blantyre |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads in Malawi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Frequent services on main routes |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, e.g., Lilongwe to Blantyre |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Malawi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider using minibuses or shared taxis, which are generally cheaper than metered taxis.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Bolt to get around cities, as they offer a convenient and relatively affordable way to travel.\n- Always negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before you start your journey, especially if you're traveling to a rural area.\n- Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night, and avoid traveling alone in isolated areas.\n- Consider renting a car for long-distance travel, as it can be more cost-effective than taking multiple buses or taxis.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure your safety, and always check the driver's ID before you start your journey.",
