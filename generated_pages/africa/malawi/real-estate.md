[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Malawi is growing, driven by a combination of factors including a rapidly expanding population, urbanization, and economic growth. The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a range of options available for buyers and renters. In recent years, there has been an increase in demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, which has led to a rise in property prices. The market is expected to continue growing, driven by government initiatives to improve infrastructure and attract foreign investment.

The urban-rural divide is a significant factor in the Malawian property market, with urban areas such as Lilongwe and Blantyre experiencing faster growth and higher prices than rural areas. However, rural areas are also attracting investment, particularly in the tourism sector, with many foreigners buying properties in areas such as Lake Malawi and the Mulanje Mountains. The price trajectory of the market is generally upwards, with prices increasing by around 10-15% per year in urban areas.

The market is also characterized by a lack of formal housing, with many people living in informal settlements. This has created opportunities for developers to build new homes and for investors to buy and renovate existing properties. However, the market is also subject to some risks, including a lack of infrastructure and services in some areas, and the potential for **economic instability**.
