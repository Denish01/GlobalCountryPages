# Malawi vs Mozambique

When deciding between Malawi and Mozambique, consider your priorities, as both countries offer unique experiences, with Malawi exceling in cultural heritage and scenic lakes, and Mozambique boasting an extensive coastline and vibrant cities.

[SECTION] Why People Compare Them [/SECTION]
Malawi and Mozambique are often compared due to their geographical proximity and shared history, having both been colonized by European powers and gaining independence in the mid-20th century.
