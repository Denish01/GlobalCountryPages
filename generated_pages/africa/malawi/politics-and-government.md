[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Malawi is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people and serves a five-year term. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Assembly, which has 193 seats. Members of the National Assembly are also directly elected by the people and serve five-year terms. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court of Appeal and the High Court, which are responsible for interpreting the laws of the land.

The system of government in Malawi is designed to provide checks and balances among the three branches, ensuring that no one branch has too much power. The President has the power to appoint judges, ambassadors, and other high-ranking officials, but these appointments must be approved by the National Assembly. The National Assembly has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto them. The judicial branch has the power to declare laws and government actions unconstitutional.

Malawi's political system is also characterized by a **multiparty system**, with several political parties competing for power. This has led to a vibrant and dynamic political landscape, with parties often forming alliances and coalitions to achieve their goals.
