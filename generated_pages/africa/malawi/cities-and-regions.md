[SECTION] How Malawi Is Divided [/SECTION]
Malawi is divided into 28 districts, which are further grouped into three main regions: Northern, Central, and Southern. The country's administrative structure is designed to facilitate effective governance and development at the local level. Each district has its own council, which is responsible for providing various services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The three regions, on the other hand, serve as broader administrative units, each with its own unique character and challenges.

The division of Malawi into regions and districts is also reflective of the country's geographical and cultural diversity. The Northern Region, for example, is characterized by its mountainous terrain and is home to the country's highest peak, Mount Mulanje. The Central Region, which includes the capital city Lilongwe, is the most populous and economically developed part of the country. The Southern Region, which borders Mozambique, is known for its fertile soil and is a major producer of crops such as tobacco and tea.
