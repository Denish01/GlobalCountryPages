# Malawi Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Malawi's infrastructure is still developing, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 12% of population
Internet Penetration: 14%
Road Network: 15,452 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: 797 km
Major Airports: 7
Major Ports: None, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Malawi's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Despite recent investments in various sectors, the country still faces significant challenges in providing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The urban-rural gap in access to these services is particularly pronounced, with many rural areas lacking even the most basic infrastructure. The government has been working to address these challenges, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, improving road networks, and expanding access to clean water and sanitation.

In recent years, Malawi has seen significant investments in its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, the rehabilitation of existing ones, and the expansion of the country's energy generation capacity. However, much work remains to be done, particularly in rural areas where many communities lack access to even the most basic services. The government has also been working to promote private sector investment in the country's infrastructure, with a focus on public-private partnerships and other innovative financing models.

The development of Malawi's infrastructure is critical to the country's economic growth and development. With a growing population and an increasing demand for services, the government must work to ensure that the country's infrastructure can keep pace with this growth. This will require significant investments in the coming years, as well as a focus on sustainability and environmental protection.
