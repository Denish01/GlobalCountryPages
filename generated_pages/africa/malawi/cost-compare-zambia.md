[SECTION] Overview: Malawi vs Zambia [/SECTION]
Malawi and Zambia are two neighboring countries in southern Africa, both offering a unique blend of natural beauty, rich culture, and vibrant cities. However, when it comes to the cost of living, Malawi tends to be the more affordable option. With a lower GDP per capita and a more stable inflation rate, Malawi provides a more budget-friendly environment for expats, students, and travelers. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with a growing tourism sector, which contributes to its relatively low cost of living.

In contrast, Zambia has a more diversified economy, with a strong mining sector and a growing service industry. This has led to a higher cost of living, particularly in the capital city of Lusaka. However, Zambia's economy is also more developed, with better infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which may make it a more attractive option for some. Overall, the choice between Malawi and Zambia will depend on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences. For those on a tight budget, Malawi may be the better choice, while those seeking a more developed economy and better amenities may prefer Zambia.
