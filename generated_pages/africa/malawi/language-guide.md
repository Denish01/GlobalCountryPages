Malawi has a diverse linguistic landscape, with over 60 languages spoken across the country. However, **Chichewa** is the most widely spoken language, understood by around 50% of the population. **English** is also widely used, particularly in urban areas, government, and education. Regional dialects and minority languages, such as Lomwe and Yao, are also spoken in various parts of the country. While English is understood by many Malawians, particularly in the service industry and among the educated population, **Chichewa** is the primary language used in everyday life. Malawi's linguistic diversity is a reflection of its cultural heritage, with many languages influenced by the country's history of trade and migration.

The use of **English** in Malawi is a legacy of the country's colonial past, and it continues to play an important role in government, education, and business.

Visitors to Malawi can expect to hear a mix of languages, including **English**, **Chichewa**, and other local languages, depending on the region and context.

Malawi's linguistic diversity is also reflected in its literature and media, with many writers, poets, and musicians drawing on the country's rich cultural heritage for inspiration.
