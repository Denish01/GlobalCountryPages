  "content": "Malawi is generally cheaper than Zambia, with a cost of living that is approximately 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMalawi GDP per Capita (PPP): $1,443\nZambia GDP per Capita (PPP): $3,983\nMalawi Inflation Rate: 9.3%\nZambia Inflation Rate: 17.4%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Malawi\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Malawi vs Zambia [/SECTION]\nMalawi and Zambia are two neighboring countries in southern Africa, both offering a unique blend of natural beauty, rich culture, and vibrant cities. However, when it comes to the cost of living, Malawi tends to be the more affordable option. With a lower GDP per capita and a more stable inflation rate, Malawi provides a more budget-friendly environment for expats, students, and travelers. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with a growing tourism sector, which contributes to its relatively low cost of living.\n\nIn contrast, Zambia has a more diversified economy, with a strong mining sector and a growing service industry. This has led to a higher cost of living, particularly in the capital city of Lusaka. However, Zambia's economy is also more developed, with better infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which may make it a more attractive option for some. Overall, the choice between Malawi and Zambia will depend on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences. For those on a tight budget, Malawi may be the better choice, while those seeking a more developed economy and better amenities may prefer Zambia.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Malawi (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $350 | 43% cheaper in Malawi |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper in Malawi |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $600 | 33% cheaper in Malawi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Malawi (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper in Malawi |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper in Malawi |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper in Malawi |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper in Malawi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Malawi (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper in Malawi |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1.00 | 50% cheaper in Malawi |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33% cheaper in Malawi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Malawi (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $80 | 37% cheaper in Malawi |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $30 | $50 | 40% cheaper in Malawi |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper in Malawi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Malawi (USD) | Zambia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $500 | $700 | 29% savings in Malawi |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,500 | 33% savings in Malawi |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $3,000 | 33% savings in Malawi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Malawi is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 43% lower than in Zambia\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries up to 50% cheaper\n  - Transportation, with taxis and fuel up to 50% cheaper\n  - Utilities and internet, with bills up to 40% lower\n- **Zambia is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain imported goods, which may be more widely available and cheaper in Zambia\n  - High-end amenities, such as luxury hotels and restaurants, which may be more developed in Zambia\n  - Business and investment opportunities, with Zambia's more diversified economy and better infrastructure\n  - Tourist activities, such as safaris and wildlife tours, which may be more developed and accessible in Zambia\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and travelers on a tight budget, Malawi is likely the better choice, with a cost of living that is significantly lower than in Zambia.
