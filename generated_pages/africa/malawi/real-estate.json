The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a range of options available for buyers and renters. In recent years, there has been an increase in demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, which has led to a rise in property prices. The market is expected to continue growing, driven by government initiatives to improve infrastructure and attract foreign investment.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is a significant factor in the Malawian property market, with urban areas such as Lilongwe and Blantyre experiencing faster growth and higher prices than rural areas. However, rural areas are also attracting investment, particularly in the tourism sector, with many foreigners buying properties in areas such as Lake Malawi and the Mulanje Mountains. The price trajectory of the market is generally upwards, with prices increasing by around 10-15% per year in urban areas.\n\nThe market is also characterized by a lack of formal housing, with many people living in informal settlements. This has created opportunities for developers to build new homes and for investors to buy and renovate existing properties. However, the market is also subject to some risks, including a lack of infrastructure and services in some areas, and the potential for **economic instability**.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lilongwe | 150 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Blantyre | 120 | 150 | House |\n| Zomba | 100 | 100 | House |\n| Mzuzu | 80 | 80 | Apartment |\n| Mangochi | 60 | 60 | House |\n| Mulanje | 40 | 40 | House |\n| Lake Malawi | 30 | 30 | Lodge |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Malawi, but they must obtain a **residence permit** or a **work permit** to do so.\n- Foreigners can also buy property through a **company structure**, which can provide additional benefits such as tax advantages.\n- Foreigners must register their property with the **Ministry of Lands** and obtain a **certificate of title**.\n- Foreigners must also obtain a **permit from the Reserve Bank of Malawi** to transfer funds into the country to buy property.\n- Foreigners can also lease property, with **leasehold agreements** available for up to 99 years.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
