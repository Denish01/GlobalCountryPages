Primary education is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 13, and is provided by government-funded schools as well as private institutions. Secondary education, on the other hand, is not compulsory and is provided by government-funded schools as well as private institutions, with students required to pay tuition fees. Tertiary education is provided by universities and colleges, with the **University of Malawi** being the oldest and largest public university in the country.\n\nThe quality of education in Malawi varies greatly depending on the institution and location, with public schools often facing challenges such as lack of resources, overcrowding, and inadequate infrastructure. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Malawians. The **Ministry of Education** is responsible for overseeing the education system and implementing policies to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curriculum and teacher training programs.\n\nDespite the challenges, the education system in Malawi has made significant progress in recent years, with an increase in enrollment rates and a decrease in dropout rates. The government has also introduced initiatives to improve the quality of education, such as the **Free Primary Education** program, which has led to a significant increase in the number of children attending school.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
