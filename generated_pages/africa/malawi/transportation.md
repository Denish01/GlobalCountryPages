[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Malawi has two main international airports, Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe and Chileka International Airport in Blantyre, which receive flights from major airlines in Africa and Europe. Direct flights to Malawi are available from hubs such as Johannesburg, Nairobi, and Addis Ababa. You can also enter Malawi overland through its borders with neighboring countries, including Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. The most common overland entry points are at the borders of Mwanza, Karonga, and Dedza.

If you plan to enter Malawi by land, it is essential to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations, as they may change. Additionally, be prepared for long queues and potential delays at the border. It is also recommended to have all necessary documents, including a valid passport, visa (if required), and car insurance (if driving), to ensure a smooth entry into the country.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Malawi's domestic air network is limited, with only a few airlines operating within the country. The main domestic airlines are Malawian Airlines and Ulendo Airlink, which offer flights between Lilongwe, Blantyre, and Mzuzu. Booking in advance is recommended, as flights can be irregular and often fully booked. The cost of domestic flights can range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and airline. It is also possible to charter a private plane or helicopter for more remote areas, but this can be expensive, with prices starting from around $1,000.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Malawi's rail network is limited, with only a few routes available, including the main line from Blantyre to Lilongwe and the branch line from Salima to Nkhotakota. The rail network is operated by the Central East African Railway (CEAR), but the quality of the trains and tracks is generally poor. There are no high-speed options available, and the journey can be slow and uncomfortable. Booking tickets can be done at the train station, but it is recommended to do so in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Malawi has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect major towns and cities. The main bus companies are AXA Coach, Fulumo Bus Company, and Shire Bus Lines, which offer daily services between Lilongwe, Blantyre, Mzuzu, and other towns. The quality of the buses can vary, but most are comfortable and reliable. Ticket prices are generally affordable, ranging from $5 to $20, depending on the route and class of service. It is recommended to book tickets in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability.
