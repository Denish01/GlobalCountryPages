        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Malawi is a low-income economy with a GDP per capita of approximately $69,355. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, which accounts for about 30% of the GDP and employs nearly 80% of the workforce. Malawi's economic development level is relatively low, with a high dependence on foreign aid and a limited industrial base. The country's economic trajectory has been impacted by various factors, including climate change, corruption, and a lack of economic diversification.</p>
        <p>Malawi's economy has been growing at a moderate rate, with an average annual growth rate of about 4% over the past decade. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including high levels of poverty and inequality. The government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, including the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy. Despite these efforts, Malawi's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related disasters.</p>
        <p>The Malawi government has been working to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. The country has made progress in simplifying regulatory procedures and reducing bureaucratic hurdles, but more needs to be done to improve the ease of doing business. Malawi's economic outlook is closely tied to the performance of the agricultural sector, which is vulnerable to climate change and other external factors. To promote economic growth and reduce poverty, the government needs to diversify the economy, invest in human capital, and improve the business environment.</p>

        <p>However, Malawi's economy still faces significant challenges, including a high dependence on foreign aid, a limited industrial base, and a vulnerability to external shocks. To promote economic growth and reduce poverty, the government needs to diversify the economy, invest in human capital, and improve the business environment. The country also needs to address the challenges posed by climate change, including droughts and floods, which can have a significant impact on the agricultural sector. With the right policies and investments, Malawi has the potential to achieve significant economic growth and reduce poverty, but it will require careful planning and implementation.</p>
