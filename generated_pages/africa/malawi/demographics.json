  "content": "The population of Malawi is a diverse and growing demographic, with approximately 20.4 million people living in the country, comprising various ethnic groups, languages, and religions. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 20.4 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.7%\nMedian Age: 17.3 years\nUrban Population: 16.4%\nPopulation Density: 173 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 63.8 years\nFertility Rate: 4.3 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nMalawi's population has been steadily increasing over the years, with a growth rate of 2.7%, which is relatively high compared to the global average. The country's population size is significant, given its geographical area of approximately 118,484 km², resulting in a population density of 173 people per km². The population is predominantly rural, with only about 16.4% of the population residing in urban areas. However, urbanization is on the rise, with many young people migrating to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Migration patterns in Malawi are also influenced by regional and international factors, including labor migration to neighboring countries and refugee movements.\n\nThe population growth trend in Malawi is expected to continue, with significant implications for the country's economic development, healthcare, and education systems. The government and development partners are working to address the challenges associated with rapid population growth, including poverty, unemployment, and limited access to basic services. To manage the population growth, the government has implemented various policies and programs, including family planning initiatives and education programs aimed at reducing fertility rates and promoting sustainable development.\n\nThe population of Malawi is also characterized by a high proportion of young people, with approximately 45% of the population under the age of 15. This demographic structure presents both opportunities and challenges, as the country seeks to harness the energy and potential of its youth while addressing the needs of its rapidly growing population. The high population growth rate and the resulting pressure on resources and infrastructure underscore the need for sustainable development strategies that balance economic growth with social and environmental considerations.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chewa | 32.6% | Central and Southern regions | Dominant ethnic group in the central and southern regions |\n| Lomwe | 18.8% | Southern region | Second-largest ethnic group, mainly found in the southern region |\n| Yao | 13.1% | Southern region | Predominantly Muslim, found in the southern region |\n| Ngoni | 11.4% | Northern and Central regions | Originally from South Africa, migrated to Malawi in the 19th century |\n| Tumbuka | 8.7% | Northern region | Mainly found in the northern region, known for their agricultural skills |\n| Sena | 3.8% | Central and Southern regions | Smaller ethnic group, found in the central and southern regions |\n| Tonga | 2.1% | Northern region | Mainly found in the northern region, known for their fishing skills |\n[/TABLE]\nMalawi's ethnic diversity is a significant aspect of its cultural heritage, with over 20 ethnic groups living in the country.
