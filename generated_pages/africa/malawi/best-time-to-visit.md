# Best Time to Visit Malawi — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Malawi is during the dry season, from May to October, when the weather is warm and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploring the country's natural beauty.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Malawi: May to October. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: November to April. Avoid: March and April due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Malawi has a subtropical climate, with three distinct seasons: cool and dry from May to August, hot and dry from September to November, and warm and wet from December to April. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is the best time to visit Malawi, as the weather is warm and sunny, with average temperatures ranging from 20 to 25 degrees Celsius. The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as heavy rainfall and potential flooding can make roads impassable and outdoor activities difficult. The country's climate varies by region, with the highlands being cooler and the lowlands being hotter.

The dry season is the peak tourist season in Malawi, and it's the best time to enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and water sports. The cool and dry weather makes it ideal for exploring the country's national parks and game reserves, such as Liwonde National Park and Nyika National Park. The hot and dry season, which runs from September to November, is also a good time to visit Malawi, as the weather is warm and sunny, and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak season.

The wet season, which runs from December to April, is the low season in Malawi, and it's not the best time to visit the country. The heavy rainfall and potential flooding can make roads impassable, and outdoor activities can be difficult. However, the wet season is the best time to see the country's lush green landscapes and waterfalls, and it's also the best time for birdwatching, as many migratory birds visit Malawi during this time.
