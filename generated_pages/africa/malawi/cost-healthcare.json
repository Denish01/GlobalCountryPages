  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Malawi can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private facilities, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources, while private facilities offer better care but at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $41 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 12.0% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed (Public and Private)\nEmergency Number: 997 or 998\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: MWK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMalawi's healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private facilities. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of resources and long waiting times. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. Locals often rely on public healthcare due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private facilities. It is recommended to have insurance to cover medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high, especially for specialized treatments.\n\nThe healthcare system in Malawi is also affected by the country's economic conditions, with a high inflation rate of 32.2% in 2024, which can impact the affordability of healthcare services. Additionally, the low GDP per capita of $1,858 in 2024 means that many Malawians struggle to access quality healthcare. The government has allocated 2.8% of the country's GDP to education in 2022, but more efforts are needed to improve the healthcare system.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city, with Lilongwe and Blantyre being more expensive |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Specialist care is often only available in private facilities |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Dental care is not always available in public facilities |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Eye care is often provided by NGOs or private facilities |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary depending on the type of test and facility |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public facilities often have limited resources and long waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | Private facilities offer better amenities and care, but at a higher cost |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Prices vary depending on the type of surgery and facility |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$200 | Public facilities often have limited resources and high mortality rates |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | MRI scans are often only available in private facilities |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | X-rays are widely available in both public and private facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$30 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers a wide range of medical expenses, including specialist care and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Covers medical expenses, including evacuations and repatriations, for foreigners |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available in pharmacies and cost between $5-$20.\n- Prescription medications are often required for certain treatments, and prices vary depending on the type of medication and facility.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may not always be regulated.\n- Prices for medications can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location.\n- It is recommended to purchase medications from reputable pharmacies to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 997 or 998 for ambulance services.
