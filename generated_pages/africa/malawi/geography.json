It is situated between the coordinates of 9° and 18° south latitude, and 32° and 36° east longitude. The country shares its borders with three neighboring countries: Mozambique to the east and south, Tanzania to the north, and Zambia to the west. Malawi is not bordered by any major oceans, but it does have a significant body of water, Lake Malawi, which is the third-largest lake in Africa and a vital part of the country's geography and economy.\n\nThe country's location in the tropics and its geography have a significant impact on its climate and environment. The Great Rift Valley, which runs from Lebanon in the north to Mozambique in the south, passes through Malawi, creating a diverse range of landscapes and ecosystems. The country's borders are relatively long, with a total length of approximately 2,881 kilometers. The border with Mozambique is the longest, stretching for about 1,569 kilometers, while the border with Zambia is the shortest, at around 267 kilometers.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nMalawi's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, plateaus, and valleys. The country can be divided into three main regions: the northern region, which is dominated by the Nyika Plateau; the central region, which is home to the capital city Lilongwe and the country's largest river, the Lilongwe River; and the southern region, which is characterized by the Shire River valley and the country's highest peak, Mount Mulanje. The Nyika Plateau is a high-altitude plateau that covers much of northern Malawi, with an average elevation of around 2,000 meters. The plateau is known for its rolling hills, grasslands, and scenic valleys.\n\nThe central region of Malawi is home to a mix of mountains and valleys, with the Lilongwe River flowing through the capital city. The river is an important source of water and transportation for the city and the surrounding areas. The southern region of Malawi is dominated by the Shire River valley, which is a fertile and densely populated area. The valley is home to a range of crops, including tobacco, tea, and sugarcane, and is an important agricultural region for the country. Mount Mulanje, located in the southern region, is a prominent feature of Malawi's landscape, with its highest peak reaching an elevation of 3,002 meters.\n\nMalawi is also home to a range of lakes and rivers, including Lake Malawi, which is the country's most prominent water feature. The lake is approximately 580 kilometers long and 75 kilometers wide, and is a vital source of fish and other aquatic resources for the country. The lake is also an important tourist destination, with its clear waters and scenic surroundings making it a popular spot for swimming, snorkeling, and other water activities.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Summer | November to March | 22-30°C | high | hot and humid |\n| Autumn | April to May | 18-25°C | moderate | mild and dry |\n| Winter | June to August | 12-20°C | low | cool and dry |\n| Spring | September to October | 18-25°C | moderate | mild and dry |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: May to October.
