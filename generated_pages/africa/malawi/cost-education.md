[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Malawi's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary greatly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction in Malawi is primarily English, with Chichewa being the dominant local language. Compulsory education in Malawi lasts for 8 years, from primary 1 to primary 8. International schools are also available in major cities like Lilongwe and Blantyre, offering a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.

The quality of education in Malawi's public sector is often affected by factors such as limited resources, overcrowding, and a shortage of qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools tend to have better facilities, smaller class sizes, and more qualified teachers, resulting in a higher quality of education. However, this comes at a cost, making private education inaccessible to many Malawians. International schools in Malawi offer a high-quality education, but are typically very expensive and cater mainly to expatriates and wealthy locals.
