[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Malawi's healthcare system is structured into three main tiers: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with the Ministry of Health overseeing the system. However, the quality of care and accessibility can vary significantly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality services, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the average Malawian. The **public-private partnership** model is being explored to improve the overall quality of healthcare services.

The quality of care in Malawi's healthcare system is a major concern, with issues such as shortage of skilled healthcare workers, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of essential medical supplies. The system is also often overwhelmed by the high burden of diseases such as **HIV/AIDS**, **malaria**, and **tuberculosis**. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of **free healthcare** for certain groups, such as children under five and pregnant women.

Access to healthcare services is also a significant issue in Malawi, particularly in rural areas where **geographical barriers** and lack of transportation can make it difficult for people to reach healthcare facilities. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve access, including the deployment of **community health workers** and the establishment of **rural health centers**.
