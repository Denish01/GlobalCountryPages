[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Malawi is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with the **Malawi Rent Act** governing the relationship between landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors, Malawi's housing costs are relatively low, with Mozambique and Zambia being more expensive. However, the high **inflation rate** of 32.2% can impact the cost of living, including rent and housing prices.

The housing market in Malawi is also influenced by the country's **GDP per capita** of $1,858, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. This can affect the affordability of housing, particularly for low-income households. Additionally, the **health expenditure per capita** of $41 and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 12.0% can also impact the overall cost of living, including housing costs. Despite these challenges, Malawi's housing market offers a range of options for expats and locals, from modern apartments in city centers to traditional houses in rural areas.
