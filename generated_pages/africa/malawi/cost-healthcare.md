[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Malawi's healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private facilities. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of resources and long waiting times. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. Locals often rely on public healthcare due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private facilities. It is recommended to have insurance to cover medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high, especially for specialized treatments.

The healthcare system in Malawi is also affected by the country's economic conditions, with a high inflation rate of 32.2% in 2024, which can impact the affordability of healthcare services. Additionally, the low GDP per capita of $1,858 in 2024 means that many Malawians struggle to access quality healthcare. The government has allocated 2.8% of the country's GDP to education in 2022, but more efforts are needed to improve the healthcare system.
