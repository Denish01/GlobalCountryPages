  "content": "Malawi's infrastructure is still developing, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 12% of population\nInternet Penetration: 14%\nRoad Network: 15,452 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: 797 km\nMajor Airports: 7\nMajor Ports: None, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMalawi's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Despite recent investments in various sectors, the country still faces significant challenges in providing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The urban-rural gap in access to these services is particularly pronounced, with many rural areas lacking even the most basic infrastructure. The government has been working to address these challenges, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, improving road networks, and expanding access to clean water and sanitation.\n\nIn recent years, Malawi has seen significant investments in its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, the rehabilitation of existing ones, and the expansion of the country's energy generation capacity. However, much work remains to be done, particularly in rural areas where many communities lack access to even the most basic services. The government has also been working to promote private sector investment in the country's infrastructure, with a focus on public-private partnerships and other innovative financing models.\n\nThe development of Malawi's infrastructure is critical to the country's economic growth and development. With a growing population and an increasing demand for services, the government must work to ensure that the country's infrastructure can keep pace with this growth. This will require significant investments in the coming years, as well as a focus on sustainability and environmental protection.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 15,452 km | Poor | Many roads are unpaved and in poor condition, particularly in rural areas |\n| Railways | 797 km | Moderate | The rail network is limited and in need of rehabilitation |\n| Airports | 7 international, 10 domestic | Good | Major airports include Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe and Chileka International Airport in Blantyre |\n| Ports | None | N/A | Malawi is landlocked, but has access to ports in neighboring countries such as Mozambique and Tanzania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Malawi's power generation capacity is mostly based on **hydroelectric power**, with the Shire River being the main source of electricity.\n- The country's energy sector is characterized by frequent **power outages**, particularly during periods of low water levels in the Shire River.\n- The government has been working to increase the country's **renewable energy** capacity, with a focus on solar and wind power.\n- Malawi has also been exploring the possibility of importing electricity from neighboring countries, particularly Mozambique and Tanzania.\n- The country's **electricity access** rate is still relatively low, with only 12% of the population having access to electricity.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern in Malawi, with many people lacking access to safe and clean drinking water.\n- The country's **sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many communities lacking access to proper sanitation facilities.\n- In rural areas, many people rely on **traditional water sources**, such as rivers and wells, which can be contaminated and pose health risks.\n- The government has been working to increase access to **clean water** and sanitation, with a focus on rural areas.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities lacking access to even the most basic water infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Malawi's **mobile coverage** is relatively good, with most areas of the country having access to mobile phone services.\n- The country's **fiber/broadband** network is still limited, with many areas lacking access to high-speed internet.\n- The government has been working to expand the country's **4G/5G** network, with a focus on increasing access to high-speed internet.\n- **Postal services** are also available in Malawi, although they are not as widely used as they once were.\n- The country's **internet penetration** rate is still relatively low, with only 14% of the population having access to the internet.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has been working on a number of **major infrastructure projects**, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones.\n- The **Lilongwe-Kamuzu International Airport** expansion project is one of the major ongoing projects, with a focus on increasing the airport's capacity and improving its facilities.\n- The **Malawi Rural Energy Project** is another major ongoing project, with a focus on increasing access to electricity in rural areas.\n- The government has also been working on the **National Water Development Project**, with a focus on increasing access to clean water and sanitation.\n- The **Malawi Transport Sector Project** is a major ongoing project, with a focus on improving the country's transport infrastructure and increasing access to markets.",
