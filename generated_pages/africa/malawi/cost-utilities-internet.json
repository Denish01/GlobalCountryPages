  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Malawi can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $50 to $150 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($100 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: MWK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nMalawi's utility infrastructure is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities in Malawi can be unstable and fluctuating, with prices increasing due to inflation and currency devaluation. The inflation rate in Malawi is currently at 32.2%, which affects the cost of utilities and other essential services. Additionally, there is a seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season, which can lead to increased prices.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Malawi varies depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to reliable utilities than rural areas. However, even in urban areas, the quality of utilities can be inconsistent, with frequent power outages and water shortages. The government is working to improve the utility infrastructure, but it is a challenging task due to limited resources and funding. As a result, many households and businesses rely on alternative sources of energy, such as solar power and generators, to supplement the grid.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $20 | $30 | $50 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $25 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | propane tanks |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in rent or separate |\n| **Total** | **$40** | **$65** | **$105** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | TNM, Airtel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | TNM, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | TNM, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-50 GB | TNM, Airtel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-100 | varies | TNM, Airtel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | available in Malawi |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Malawi |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Malawi, it is recommended to contact the service providers directly, such as the Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) for electricity and the Lilongwe Water Board for water.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households and businesses manage their energy usage and costs.\n- The best internet providers in Malawi are TNM and Airtel, which offer a range of plans and services, including fiber internet and mobile data.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use alternative sources of energy, such as solar power.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with service providers to get the best rates and plans, especially for large households or businesses.",
