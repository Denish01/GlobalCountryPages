Direct flights to Malawi are available from hubs such as Johannesburg, Nairobi, and Addis Ababa. You can also enter Malawi overland through its borders with neighboring countries, including Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. The most common overland entry points are at the borders of Mwanza, Karonga, and Dedza.\n\nIf you plan to enter Malawi by land, it is essential to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations, as they may change. Additionally, be prepared for long queues and potential delays at the border. It is also recommended to have all necessary documents, including a valid passport, visa (if required), and car insurance (if driving), to ensure a smooth entry into the country.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nMalawi's domestic air network is limited, with only a few airlines operating within the country. The main domestic airlines are Malawian Airlines and Ulendo Airlink, which offer flights between Lilongwe, Blantyre, and Mzuzu. Booking in advance is recommended, as flights can be irregular and often fully booked. The cost of domestic flights can range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and airline. It is also possible to charter a private plane or helicopter for more remote areas, but this can be expensive, with prices starting from around $1,000.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nMalawi's rail network is limited, with only a few routes available, including the main line from Blantyre to Lilongwe and the branch line from Salima to Nkhotakota.
