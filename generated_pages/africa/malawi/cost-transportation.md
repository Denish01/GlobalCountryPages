[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Getting around Malawi can be challenging, especially in rural areas where the road network is limited. The main transportation modes in Malawi are buses, minibuses, and taxis, with most people relying on these modes to get around. The quality of public transit is generally good in urban areas, with frequent bus services connecting major cities and towns. However, in rural areas, public transportation is limited, and many people rely on walking or cycling to get around.

In urban areas, such as Lilongwe and Blantyre, the public transportation system is relatively well-developed, with a network of buses and minibuses connecting different parts of the city. The minibuses, also known as **matolas**, are a popular mode of transport, offering a cheap and convenient way to get around. However, the traffic in these cities can be chaotic, and the roads are often congested, making it essential to plan your journey in advance.
