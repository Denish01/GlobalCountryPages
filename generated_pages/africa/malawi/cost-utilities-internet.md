[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Malawi's utility infrastructure is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities in Malawi can be unstable and fluctuating, with prices increasing due to inflation and currency devaluation. The inflation rate in Malawi is currently at 32.2%, which affects the cost of utilities and other essential services. Additionally, there is a seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season, which can lead to increased prices.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Malawi varies depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to reliable utilities than rural areas. However, even in urban areas, the quality of utilities can be inconsistent, with frequent power outages and water shortages. The government is working to improve the utility infrastructure, but it is a challenging task due to limited resources and funding. As a result, many households and businesses rely on alternative sources of energy, such as solar power and generators, to supplement the grid.
