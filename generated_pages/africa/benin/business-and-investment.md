However, the bureaucracy level is still relatively high, and corruption remains a significant challenge. The country has made efforts to combat corruption, but it remains a major obstacle to doing business in Benin. The business environment is also affected by the country's limited infrastructure, particularly in the transportation and energy sectors.

The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the business climate, including the creation of a one-stop shop for investors and the establishment of a business facilitation center. These initiatives aim to reduce the time and cost of starting and operating a business in Benin. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of access to finance, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Benin's economy is also heavily reliant on the agricultural sector, which is vulnerable to climate change and other external factors. The country is working to diversify its economy, but this will require significant investment in other sectors, such as manufacturing and energy. The government has identified these sectors as key areas for growth and has implemented various incentives to attract investors.
