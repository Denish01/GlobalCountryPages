[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Benin is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Beninese families. The language of instruction in Beninese schools is **French**, which is the official language of the country. Compulsory education in Benin lasts for 6 years, from the age of 6 to 12, and is divided into primary and secondary education.

The quality of education in Benin is a major concern, with many schools lacking qualified teachers and basic resources.

International schools in Benin offer a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**, and are popular among expat families.
