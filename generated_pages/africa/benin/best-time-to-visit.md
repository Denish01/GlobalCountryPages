[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Benin is a tropical country with a dry and wet season, each affecting travel in different ways. The dry season, which lasts from December to April, is characterized by a cooler and drier climate, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C. This season is ideal for traveling, as the roads are passable, and the weather is pleasant. In contrast, the wet season, which lasts from May to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making travel more challenging. The wet season can be divided into two periods: the minor wet season from May to July and the major wet season from September to November.

The climate in Benin varies by region, with the coastal area being generally cooler than the interior. The northern part of the country, which is closer to the Sahara Desert, is hotter and drier than the southern part. The seasons also affect the country's wildlife, with the dry season being the best time to see animals such as elephants and lions, as they congregate around water sources.

The dry and wet seasons also impact the country's cultural events and festivals. Many festivals and events take place during the dry season, when the weather is more favorable. For example, the **Fête du Vodoun**, a festival celebrating the traditional Vodoun religion, takes place in January, during the dry season.
