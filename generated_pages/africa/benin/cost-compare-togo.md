[SECTION] Overview: Benin vs Togo [/SECTION]
Benin and Togo are two neighboring countries in West Africa, sharing similar cultural and economic contexts. However, their cost of living differs significantly, with Benin being the more affordable option. The overall cost of living in Benin is around 10-15% lower than in Togo, making it an attractive destination for expats, students, and retirees looking for a budget-friendly lifestyle. The economic context of both countries is characterized by a growing service sector, a large informal economy, and a dependence on agriculture.

The main reason for the difference in cost of living between Benin and Togo is the variation in prices for housing, food, and transportation. Benin has a more developed housing market, with a wider range of affordable options available, particularly outside of the city center. Additionally, the cost of food and transportation in Benin is generally lower than in Togo, making it easier for individuals to get by on a limited budget. However, it's worth noting that Togo has a more developed tourism industry, which can drive up prices for certain goods and services, particularly in the capital city of Lomé.
