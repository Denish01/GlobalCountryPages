# Benin Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Benin is still developing, with significant gaps between urban and rural areas, but recent investments have improved the country's transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 34.6% of population
Internet Penetration: 12.1%
Road Network: 6,787 km, mostly paved but in moderate condition
Rail Network: 578 km
Major Airports: 1 international, 5 domestic
Major Ports: 1 major port, Cotonou
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Benin's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in transportation, energy, and telecommunications. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has implemented several initiatives to address these gaps, including the development of a national infrastructure plan and the establishment of a public-private partnership framework to attract foreign investment.

The urban-rural divide is a major challenge for Benin's infrastructure development. While cities like Cotonou and Porto-Novo have relatively well-developed infrastructure, rural areas often lack access to basic services. This has significant implications for economic development, as many rural communities are unable to participate in the formal economy due to a lack of infrastructure. The government has recognized this challenge and is working to address it through targeted investments in rural infrastructure.

Despite these challenges, Benin has made significant progress in recent years. The country has invested heavily in its transportation network, including the development of a new international airport and the rehabilitation of several major roads. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives to improve access to energy and clean water, including the development of a national energy plan and the establishment of a water and sanitation agency.
