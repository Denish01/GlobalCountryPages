  "content": "The population of Benin is comprised of approximately 13.4 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that contribute to the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 13.4 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 3.5%\nMedian Age: 18.8 years\nUrban Population: 44%\nPopulation Density: 118 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 61 years\nFertility Rate: 4.8 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nBenin's population is relatively small compared to other countries in West Africa, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 3.5%, which is higher than the global average. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and declining mortality rates. The median age of the population is 18.8 years, indicating a relatively young population. Urbanization is also on the rise, with approximately 44% of the population living in urban areas. The population density is around 118 people per square kilometer, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe population of Benin is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that it will reach 20 million by 2030. This growth will likely put pressure on the country's resources, infrastructure, and services. However, it also presents opportunities for economic growth and development. Benin has a relatively high population growth rate compared to other countries in the region, which is driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and declining mortality rates.\n\nMigration patterns in Benin are also significant, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities. This has led to the growth of cities such as Cotonou and Porto-Novo, which are the country's largest urban centers. However, migration has also led to challenges such as urban poverty, overcrowding, and strain on public services.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fon | 39% | South | Dominant ethnic group in the south |\n| Yoruba | 12% | South | Significant minority in the south |\n| Bariba | 9% | North | Dominant ethnic group in the north |\n| Peuhl | 7% | North | Nomadic ethnic group |\n| Ottamari | 6% | North | Significant minority in the north |\n| Dendi | 5% | North | Minority ethnic group in the north |\n| Other | 22% | Throughout | Various smaller ethnic groups |\n[/TABLE]\nBenin is a multi-ethnic country, with over 40 ethnic groups represented.
