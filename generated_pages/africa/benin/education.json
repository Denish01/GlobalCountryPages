Primary education, which is compulsory, lasts for six years and is designed to provide students with a foundation in core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. Secondary education, which is not compulsory, lasts for seven years and is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for four years and provides a general education, while the second cycle lasts for three years and provides more specialized training. Tertiary education is provided by universities and other institutions, and offers a range of academic programs in fields such as medicine, law, and engineering. The quality of education in Benin is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on theoretical knowledge and critical thinking. However, the system is not without its challenges, including a lack of resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe education system in Benin is also characterized by a mix of public and private institutions. Public schools are generally less expensive than private schools, but may not offer the same level of quality or resources. Private schools, on the other hand, often have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but may be more expensive and exclusive. Despite these challenges, the education system in Benin has made significant progress in recent years, with an increasing number of students accessing education and achieving good results.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the education system in Benin is its emphasis on **language skills**, with a strong focus on **French** as the primary language of instruction. This has helped to promote a sense of national identity and has facilitated communication and trade with other French-speaking countries in the region. However, the system also faces challenges, including a lack of resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, and a need for more **vocational training** programs to prepare students for the workforce.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
