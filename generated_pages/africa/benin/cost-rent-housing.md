[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Benin is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms in Benin are for one to three years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with laws in place to prevent unfair eviction and ensure that landlords maintain their properties. Compared to its regional neighbors, Benin's housing costs are generally lower, making it an attractive option for those looking to relocate to West Africa. The country's relatively low cost of living and affordable housing make it an excellent choice for expats, digital nomads, and entrepreneurs.

The housing market in Benin is also influenced by the country's growing economy and infrastructure development. As the country continues to develop its infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public transportation, the demand for housing is likely to increase. This, in turn, may lead to an increase in housing prices, particularly in urban areas such as Porto-Novo and Cotonou. However, for now, the housing market in Benin remains relatively affordable, with plenty of options available for those looking to rent or buy.
