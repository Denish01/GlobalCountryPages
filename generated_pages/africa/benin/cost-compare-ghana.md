[SECTION] Overview: Benin vs Ghana [/SECTION]
Benin and Ghana are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Benin has a relatively low GDP per capita and inflation rate compared to Ghana, which translates to a lower cost of living. The economic context of Benin is primarily driven by agriculture, trade, and services, while Ghana has a more diversified economy with significant contributions from mining, manufacturing, and tourism. As a result, Benin tends to be more affordable for everyday expenses, including rent, food, and transportation. The cost difference between the two countries can be significant, with Benin offering savings of around 15-20% on average.

The cost of living disparity between Benin and Ghana is largely attributed to the differences in economic development, urbanization, and consumer prices. Ghana's larger economy and higher standard of living lead to increased demand and prices for goods and services, particularly in urban areas like Accra. In contrast, Benin's smaller economy and lower demand result in more affordable prices for similar products and services. However, it's essential to note that both countries have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and the cost of living is just one aspect to consider when deciding which country to visit or live in.
