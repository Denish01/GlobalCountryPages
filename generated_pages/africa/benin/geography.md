[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Benin is a **sovereign** country located in **West Africa**, bordered by several countries including Togo to the west, Burkina Faso and Niger to the north, and Nigeria to the east. The country has a relatively short coastline along the **Atlantic Ocean** to the south, with the **Gulf of Guinea** forming its southern border. Benin's strategic location allows it to serve as a gateway between West Africa and the rest of the world.

The country's borders are largely defined by its colonial history, with the modern-day borders established during the **Scramble for Africa** in the late 19th century. Benin's neighbors are all diverse countries with their own unique cultures and histories, and the country's location allows it to be an important hub for trade and commerce in the region. The capital city, **Porto-Novo**, is located on the coast and serves as the country's administrative and economic center.

The country's highest point, **Mount Sokbaro**, is located in the northwest and rises to an elevation of 658 meters. The **Niger River** forms part of Benin's northern border, and the **Ouémé River** flows through the country from north to south, providing water and fertile soil for agriculture.

The country's coastal region is generally flat and low-lying, with a number of **lagoons** and **wetlands** that provide habitat for a wide range of **wildlife**.
