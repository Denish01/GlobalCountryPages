        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Benin is a low-income economy with a GDP per capita of approximately $1,110. The country has been making progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average rate of 4-5% per annum. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, particularly fluctuations in global commodity prices. Benin's economy is primarily driven by the agricultural sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP. The country is also rich in natural resources, including cotton, palm oil, and limestone.</p>
        <p>Benin's economic development has been hindered by several factors, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to credit, and a high dependence on a few primary commodities. The country has been working to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing the manufacturing and services sectors. The government has also implemented several reforms aimed at improving the business environment and attracting foreign investment. Despite these efforts, Benin's economy remains one of the poorest in the world, and the country continues to face significant development challenges.</p>
        <p>Benin's economy is also heavily influenced by its geographical location. The country is situated in West Africa, and its economy is closely tied to that of its neighbors, particularly Nigeria. Benin is a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), which provides the country with access to a larger market and a common currency, the XOF.</p>
