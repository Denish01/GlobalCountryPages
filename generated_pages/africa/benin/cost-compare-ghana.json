  "content": "Benin is generally cheaper than Ghana, with a cost of living difference of around 15-20% in favor of Benin.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nBenin GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,552\nGhana GDP per Capita (PPP): 6,956\nBenin Inflation Rate: 2.8%\nGhana Inflation Rate: 7.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Benin\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Benin vs Ghana [/SECTION]\nBenin and Ghana are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Benin has a relatively low GDP per capita and inflation rate compared to Ghana, which translates to a lower cost of living. The economic context of Benin is primarily driven by agriculture, trade, and services, while Ghana has a more diversified economy with significant contributions from mining, manufacturing, and tourism. As a result, Benin tends to be more affordable for everyday expenses, including rent, food, and transportation. The cost difference between the two countries can be significant, with Benin offering savings of around 15-20% on average.\n\nThe cost of living disparity between Benin and Ghana is largely attributed to the differences in economic development, urbanization, and consumer prices. Ghana's larger economy and higher standard of living lead to increased demand and prices for goods and services, particularly in urban areas like Accra. In contrast, Benin's smaller economy and lower demand result in more affordable prices for similar products and services. However, it's essential to note that both countries have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and the cost of living is just one aspect to consider when deciding which country to visit or live in.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Benin (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 100 | 180 | 44% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 300 | 500 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Benin (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 8 | 37% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Benin (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 0.80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Benin (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Benin (USD) | Ghana (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Benin is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with savings of up to 40% on apartments\n- Food and dining, with meal prices 37% lower on average\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices 33-37% cheaper\n- Utilities and internet, with bills 37-50% lower\n- **Ghana is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and luxury goods, with a wider range of international brands\n- Tourism and travel, with more developed infrastructure and attractions\n- Education, with a greater number of international schools and universities\n- Business and investment, with a more favorable business environment and government incentives\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nBenin offers a more affordable cost of living, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees on a budget. The country's low prices for rent, food, and transportation can help stretch limited finances, allowing individuals to enjoy a relatively comfortable lifestyle. However, Ghana's more developed economy and higher standard of living may appeal to those seeking a more modern and convenient lifestyle, with access to better amenities and services. Ultimately, the choice between Benin and Ghana depends on individual priorities and preferences, with both countries offering unique advantages and disadvantages. For those prioritizing affordability and a simple lifestyle, Benin may be the better choice, while those seeking a more cosmopolitan experience and greater opportunities may prefer Ghana.",
