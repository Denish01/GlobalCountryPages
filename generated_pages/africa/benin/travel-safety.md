[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Benin is generally a safe country to visit, with low levels of violent crime. However, petty crimes such as pickpocketing, purse snatching, and scams are common in tourist areas and crowded markets. Visitors should be cautious when walking alone at night, especially in poorly lit areas, and avoid carrying large amounts of cash. The country has a relatively stable political climate, but demonstrations and protests can occur, and visitors should avoid areas where large crowds are gathering.

As with any travel destination, it's essential to take common-sense precautions to stay safe in Benin. This includes being aware of your surroundings, keeping valuables secure, and avoiding traveling alone at night. The Beninese government has taken steps to improve security, including the establishment of a tourist police force, which can provide assistance to visitors. Despite the potential risks, many tourists visit Benin each year without incident, and with proper planning and precautions, you can have a safe and enjoyable trip.
