[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Benin has several international airports, with Cotonou Cadjehoun Airport (COO) being the main hub, located in the country's largest city, Cotonou. The airport receives direct flights from major European cities such as Paris and Brussels, as well as from other West African countries. You can also enter Benin by land from neighboring countries such as Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria. The main overland entry points are located in the towns of Hillacondji, Malanville, and Kraké, where you can find border crossings with customs and immigration offices.

If you're traveling from other parts of Africa or from outside the continent, you may need to connect through a major hub such as Addis Ababa, Casablanca, or Istanbul. Several airlines, including Turkish Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, and Ethiopian Airlines, offer flights to Cotonou with layovers in these cities. Alternatively, you can take a bus or taxi from a neighboring country, which can be a more affordable option, especially for shorter distances. For example, the journey from Lomé, Togo, to Cotonou, Benin, takes around 4-5 hours by bus or taxi.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Benin has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airline is Trans Air Benin, which offers flights from Cotonou to other cities such as Parakou and Natitingou. You can book domestic flights online or through a local travel agency, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way ticket from Cotonou to Parakou can cost around $100-$200. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be unreliable and subject to cancellations, so it's essential to be flexible and plan ahead.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Benin does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option within the country. However, there have been plans to develop a rail line connecting Benin to neighboring countries, which could potentially provide a faster and more efficient way to travel in the region. For now, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity buses are a popular way to travel in Benin, with several companies operating routes between major cities. The main bus companies are Confort Line, Benin-Routes, and STMB, which offer services from Cotonou to cities such as Parakou, Natitingou, and Djougou. Bus travel can be relatively affordable, with prices starting from around $10-$20 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and quality of service. However, buses can be crowded and uncomfortable, and road conditions can be poor, making journeys longer than expected.
