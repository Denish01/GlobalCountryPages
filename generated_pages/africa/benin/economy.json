The country has been making progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average rate of 4-5% per annum.

The country has been working to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing the manufacturing and services sectors.

Despite these efforts, Benin's economy remains one of the poorest in the world, and the country continues to face significant development challenges.\n\nBenin's economy is also heavily influenced by its geographical location.
