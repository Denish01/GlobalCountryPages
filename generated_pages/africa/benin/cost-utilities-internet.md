[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Benin is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. However, the government has been investing in improving the infrastructure, and the costs of utilities have been relatively stable in recent years. The inflation rate in Benin is currently at 1.2%, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The cost of utilities can vary depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season when water is scarce.

The quality of utility services in Benin can also vary depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better services than rural areas. The cost of utilities is also affected by the fact that many households rely on prepaid meters for electricity and water, which can be more expensive than postpaid options. However, the use of prepaid meters has also helped to reduce the risk of accumulation of unpaid bills and has made it easier for households to manage their utility costs.
