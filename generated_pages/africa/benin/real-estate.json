The market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern properties, with a range of options available for buyers and renters. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with prices relatively low compared to other countries in the region. However, the market is still developing, and buyers should be prepared for a potentially complex and time-consuming process. The price trajectory in Benin is generally upward, with prices increasing in urban areas such as Cotonou and Porto-Novo. The urban areas are more developed, with better infrastructure and amenities, while the rural areas are less developed and often lack basic services.\n\nThe market in Benin is also influenced by the country's strategic location, with its port city of Cotonou serving as a major trade hub for the region. This has led to an increase in demand for commercial and industrial properties, particularly in the port area. The government has also implemented policies to encourage foreign investment, including the creation of a one-stop shop for investors and the introduction of tax incentives for certain types of investments. Despite these efforts, the market still faces challenges, including a lack of transparency and a complex regulatory framework.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is also a significant factor in the property market in Benin. Urban areas such as Cotonou and Porto-Novo have a higher demand for properties, with prices and rents generally higher than in rural areas. However, rural areas also offer opportunities for investment, particularly in the agriculture sector. The government has implemented policies to support agricultural development, including the provision of subsidies and training for farmers. This has led to an increase in demand for rural properties, particularly for farms and other agricultural land.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cotonou | 600 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Porto-Novo | 500 | 150 | House |\n| Abomey | 400 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Parakou | 300 | 80 | House |\n| Natitingou | 250 | 60 | Apartment |\n| Djougou | 200 | 50 | House |\n| Bohicon | 350 | 120 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Benin, but they must obtain a **residence permit** before making a purchase.\n- Foreigners can also buy property through a **company structure**, which can provide additional benefits such as tax incentives.\n- There are no restrictions on the type of property that foreigners can buy, but they must comply with all relevant laws and regulations.\n- Foreigners must obtain a **certificate of ownership** from the relevant authorities before transferring the property.\n- Foreigners must also pay a **registration fee** of up to 10% of the purchase price, depending on the type of property and its location.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
