Regional variations are also evident, with the north being known for its **Sosso** and **Mafé** dishes, while the south is famous for its **Akara** and **Egusi**. The use of **peanuts**, **chilies**, and **tomatoes** is common throughout the country, adding depth and heat to many dishes.\n\nBenin's cuisine is also heavily influenced by its history as a French colony, with many dishes adopting French names and cooking techniques. However, the use of local ingredients and spices has maintained a distinctly African flavor. The country's cuisine is also shaped by its cultural and religious traditions, with many dishes being served at special occasions and celebrations. For example, **Thieboudienne** is a popular dish served during weddings and holidays, made with a mixture of rice, fish, and vegetables.\n\nThe food culture in Benin is also characterized by its strong sense of community and hospitality. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to socialize and bond with family and friends, with food playing a central role in these gatherings. The tradition of **breaking bread** together is an important part of Beninese culture, and visitors are often invited to join in and share a meal with locals.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Akara | Breakfast | Fried bean cakes served with a tomato-based sauce | Street vendors and markets |\n| Thieboudienne | Lunch | A hearty dish made with rice, fish, and vegetables | Restaurants in Cotonou and Porto-Novo |\n| Mafé | Dinner | A rich stew made with meat or fish, peanuts, and vegetables | Traditional restaurants in the north |\n| Sosso | Snack | A spicy peanut sauce served with grilled meat or vegetables | Street vendors and markets |\n| Egusi | Lunch | A thick stew made with ground melon seeds and vegetables | Restaurants in the south |\n| Grilled Fish | Dinner | Fresh fish grilled over an open flame, served with a side of vegetables | Beachside restaurants |\n| Seafood Stew | Dinner | A flavorful stew made with a variety of seafood, including fish, shrimp, and mussels | Restaurants in Cotonou and Porto-Novo |\n| Amiwo | Breakfast | A sweet porridge made with cornmeal and milk | Street vendors and markets |\n| Kuli-Kuli | Snack | A crunchy snack made with peanuts and spices | Street vendors and markets |\n| Djenkoume | Dinner | A hearty dish made with cornmeal and meat or fish | Traditional restaurants in the north |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Akara**: fried bean cakes served with a tomato-based sauce, $1-2 USD\n- **Sosso**: spicy peanut sauce served with grilled meat or vegetables, $2-3 USD\n- **Kuli-Kuli**: crunchy snack made with peanuts and spices, $1-2 USD\n- **Amiwo**: sweet porridge made with cornmeal and milk, $1-2 USD\n- **Grilled Plantains**: ripe plantains grilled over an open flame, $1-2 USD\n- **Fried Cassava**: crispy fried cassava served with a side of peanut sauce, $2-3 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Palm Wine**: a traditional drink made from fermented palm sap, $2-3 USD\n- **Ginger Beer**: a spicy and refreshing drink made with ginger and lemon, $1-2 USD\n- **Fresh Juice**: a variety of fresh juices made with local fruits, $2-3 USD\n- **Beer**: a selection of local and international beers, $3-5 USD\n- **Water**: bottled water is widely available, $1-2 USD\n- **Fresh Coconut Water**: a refreshing and hydrating drink, $1-2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with your hands**: it is customary to eat with your hands in Benin, especially when eating traditional dishes\n- **Respect for elders**: it is customary to show respect to elders by allowing them to eat first and serving them the best portions\n- **Tipping**: 5-10% of the total bill is customary in restaurants\n- **Dress code**: dress modestly when eating in traditional restaurants or at home\n- **Reservation culture**: reservations are not always necessary, but it is a good idea to call ahead to confirm availability\n- **Table manners**: it is considered polite to wait for the host to invite you to eat before starting your meal\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Street vendors**: a variety of street vendors selling traditional dishes and snacks\n- **Markets**: bustling markets selling fresh produce, meats, and spices\n- **Traditional restaurants**: restaurants serving traditional Beninese cuisine\n- **International restaurants**: restaurants serving a variety of international cuisines, including French, Chinese, and Italian\n- **Food courts**: food courts offering a selection of local and international dishes\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Dantokpa Market**: a large market in Cotonou selling a variety of fresh produce, meats, and spices\n- **Porto-Novo Market**: a bustling market in Porto-Novo selling traditional dishes and snacks\n- **Benin City Food Tour**: a guided tour of the city's culinary scene, including visits to street vendors and traditional restaurants\n- **Cooking Class**: a cooking class where you can learn to make traditional Beninese dishes\n- **Festival of Food**: an annual festival celebrating Beninese cuisine, with live music, dancing, and food stalls selling traditional dishes",
