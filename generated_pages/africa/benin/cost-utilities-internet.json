  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Benin can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $60 to $150 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($100 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Benin is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. However, the government has been investing in improving the infrastructure, and the costs of utilities have been relatively stable in recent years. The inflation rate in Benin is currently at 1.2%, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The cost of utilities can vary depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season when water is scarce.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Benin can also vary depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better services than rural areas. The cost of utilities is also affected by the fact that many households rely on prepaid meters for electricity and water, which can be more expensive than postpaid options. However, the use of prepaid meters has also helped to reduce the risk of accumulation of unpaid bills and has made it easier for households to manage their utility costs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | prepaid meter |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | prepaid meter |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$55** | **$95** | **$135** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Benin Telecom, MTN |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Benin Telecom, MTN |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | MTN, Moov, Glo |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-50 GB | MTN, Moov, Glo |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-70 | varies | Benin Telecom, MTN |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in English and French |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in English and French |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | available in French and local languages |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Benin, it is recommended to contact the utility providers directly, such as Benin Telecom for internet and phone services, and the Benin Electricity Company for electricity.\n- Prepaid electricity and water meters are widely used in Benin, and can be recharged at various outlets and online platforms.\n- The best internet providers in Benin are Benin Telecom and MTN, which offer a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transport or walk or cycle when possible.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with utility providers to get the best rates and packages, especially for long-term contracts.",
