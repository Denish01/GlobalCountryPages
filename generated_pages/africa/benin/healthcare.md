[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Benin's healthcare system is characterized by a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for providing healthcare services through a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers. However, the public healthcare system is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of access to quality healthcare, especially in rural areas. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality healthcare services, but is often unaffordable for the majority of the population.

The quality of care in Benin varies greatly depending on the location and type of facility. Urban areas tend to have better-equipped and staffed facilities, while rural areas often lack basic medical supplies and trained personnel. Additionally, the public healthcare system is often plagued by issues such as corruption, mismanagement, and lack of resources, which can further exacerbate the challenges faced by patients. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system in Benin, including initiatives to increase access to healthcare, improve the quality of care, and strengthen the healthcare infrastructure.

In terms of access to healthcare, Benin has made significant progress in recent years, with the country achieving **universal health coverage** for certain services, such as vaccinations and maternal healthcare. However, there are still significant disparities in access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas, where **healthcare facilities** are often scarce and lack basic equipment and supplies. To address these disparities, the government has implemented initiatives such as the **National Health Insurance Scheme**, which aims to increase access to healthcare for vulnerable populations.
