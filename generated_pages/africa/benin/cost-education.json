The language of instruction in Beninese schools is **French**, which is the official language of the country. Compulsory education in Benin lasts for 6 years, from the age of 6 to 12, and is divided into primary and secondary education.\n\nThe quality of education in Benin is a major concern, with many schools lacking qualified teachers and basic resources.
