# Botswana Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Botswana's culture is a unique blend of traditional and modern influences. The country has a diverse population of approximately 2.6 million people, with the majority belonging to the Tswana ethnic group. The official languages are English and Setswana, with the latter being the most widely spoken. The cultural identity of Botswana is deeply rooted in its history, with the Tswana people having a rich tradition of storytelling, music, and dance. The country's strategic location in southern Africa has also exposed it to various external influences, including European and African cultures.

The Tswana people are the largest ethnic group in Botswana, making up about 80% of the population. They are divided into several sub-groups, each with their own distinct customs and traditions. The Tswana culture is known for its strong emphasis on community and respect for elders. The concept of **ubuntu**, which roughly translates to "humanity towards others," is a core value in Tswana culture, emphasizing the importance of treating others with kindness and respect. Botswana's cultural identity is also shaped by its natural environment, with the country being home to a diverse range of flora and fauna.

Botswana's cultural landscape has been influenced by its history of colonization and missionary activity. The introduction of Christianity and Western education has had a significant impact on the country's cultural development. However, traditional practices and customs continue to play an important role in Botswana's cultural identity. The government has made efforts to preserve and promote the country's cultural heritage, including the establishment of cultural festivals and traditional dance troupes. Overall, Botswana's cultural identity is a rich and complex blend of traditional and modern influences, with a strong emphasis on community, respect, and cultural preservation.
