# Botswana Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Botswana is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on road networks, but still faces challenges in terms of energy, water, and telecommunications, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 80% of population
Internet Penetration: 30%
Road Network: 18,000 km, moderate quality
Rail Network: 888 km
Major Airports: 6
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Botswana's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with significant investments in recent years. The government has prioritized infrastructure development as a key driver of economic growth and poverty reduction. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap, with better infrastructure and services available in urban areas such as Gaborone and Francistown. The country's infrastructure development is also influenced by its landlocked location, which requires significant investment in transportation infrastructure to connect to ports in neighboring countries.

The government has implemented various initiatives to improve infrastructure, including the development of a **National Infrastructure Plan**, which aims to guide infrastructure development over the next 20 years. The plan prioritizes investments in transportation, energy, and water infrastructure, as well as information and communication technology. Recent investments in infrastructure have focused on upgrading road networks, expanding energy generation capacity, and improving water supply and sanitation services.

Despite these efforts, Botswana still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including a lack of access to electricity and clean water in rural areas, and limited internet penetration. The country is also vulnerable to climate change, which can have significant impacts on infrastructure, particularly in the water and energy sectors.

[TABLE]
| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roads | 18,000 km | Moderate | Well-maintained highways, but some rural roads are in poor condition |
| Railways | 888 km | Good | Mainly used for freight transport, with some passenger services |
| Airports | 6 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern airport facilities, with regular flights to regional and international destinations |
| Ports | 0, landlocked | - | No major ports, but several border crossings with neighboring countries |
[/TABLE]

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- The main **power generation sources** are coal and diesel, with some renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power
- **Reliability** of the electricity supply is generally good, but outages can occur, particularly during peak demand periods
- **Outages** are often caused by technical faults or maintenance issues, but can also be due to load shedding during periods of high demand
- **Renewable energy progress** is slow, but the government has set targets to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix
- The **national grid** is well-developed, with connections to neighboring countries, but there are still some areas, particularly in rural areas, that are not connected to the grid

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water safety** is generally good in urban areas, but can be a concern in rural areas, where water sources may be contaminated
- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with most households having access to improved sanitation facilities
- **Water access** in rural areas is often limited, with many households relying on traditional water sources such as wells and boreholes
- **Water conservation** is a significant challenge, particularly in the face of climate change, which can lead to droughts and water scarcity
- The **water supply system** is well-developed in urban areas, with modern treatment plants and distribution networks, but can be less reliable in rural areas

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- **Mobile coverage** is relatively good, with most areas having access to mobile networks
- **Fiber/broadband** services are available in urban areas, but can be limited in rural areas
- **4G/5G rollout** is ongoing, with several mobile operators offering high-speed data services
- **Postal services** are available, but can be limited in rural areas, where mail delivery may be irregular
- **Internet cafes** are common in urban areas, providing access to internet services for those who do not have access at home

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The **Trans-Kgalagadi Highway** project aims to upgrade the road network between Botswana and Namibia
- The **Mmamabula Energy Project** is a planned coal-fired power station that will increase energy generation capacity
- The **North-South Water Carrier** project aims to improve water supply and sanitation services in rural areas
- The **Botswana Fiber Network** project aims to expand fiber-optic connectivity across the country
- The **Gaborone Dam** project aims to improve water supply and sanitation services in the capital city, and reduce the risk of water-borne diseases.
