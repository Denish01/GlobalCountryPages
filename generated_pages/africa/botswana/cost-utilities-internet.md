[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Botswana is relatively well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry winter months when water and electricity demand is higher. The government has implemented measures to stabilize utility costs, but prices can still vary depending on the provider and location. For example, electricity costs can range from $0.10 to $0.20 per kWh, depending on the usage and provider.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Botswana is generally good, with most households having access to modern amenities. However, there can be occasional outages and disruptions, particularly during peak usage periods. The government has invested in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the construction of new power plants and water treatment facilities. Despite these efforts, utility costs can still be a significant expense for households, particularly for low-income families.
