        <h2>How Botswana Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Botswana is divided into 16 districts, which are further divided into sub-districts. The country has a relatively simple administrative structure, with the districts being the primary administrative units. The districts are responsible for delivering basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure to the local population. The government has also established several councils and boards to oversee the development of specific sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and mining.</p>
        <p>The division of Botswana into districts is largely based on geographical and cultural considerations. The districts are often centered around major towns or cities, which serve as commercial and administrative hubs. The government has also established several specialized districts, such as the Chobe District, which is known for its wildlife and tourism industry, and the Southern District, which is a major agricultural producer.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>The northern regions of Botswana, such as the Chobe and North-West districts, are known for their wildlife and tourism industries, with many national parks and game reserves.</li>
        <li>The central and southern regions, such as the Central and Southern districts, are predominantly rural and agricultural, with a focus on cattle farming and crop production.</li>
        <li>The eastern regions, such as the North-East and Kgatleng districts, are also rural and agricultural, but have a stronger focus on crop production and livestock.</li>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Botswana has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with several domestic airports, roads, and bus services. The country has a number of domestic airlines, including Air Botswana, which operates flights to several major towns and cities. The roads in Botswana are generally in good condition, with several major highways and paved roads connecting the main towns and cities. However, driving in Botswana can be challenging, particularly in rural areas, due to the presence of wildlife and poor road conditions. Several bus companies, such as Intercape and Eagle Liner, operate services between the major towns and cities, and are a popular and affordable way to get around.</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Visitors to Botswana should be aware that driving at night can be hazardous, due to the presence of wildlife on the roads. It is also recommended to use a 4x4 vehicle, particularly when traveling in rural areas, as the roads can be rough and sandy. Additionally, visitors should be aware of the risk of crime, particularly in urban areas, and take necessary precautions to stay safe.</p>
