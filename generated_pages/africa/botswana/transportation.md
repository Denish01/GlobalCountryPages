[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Botswana has two main international airports: Sir Seretse Khama International Airport in Gaborone and Kasane International Airport. Sir Seretse Khama International Airport is the primary hub, with direct flights to Johannesburg, Cape Town, and other regional destinations. You can also enter Botswana overland from neighboring countries, including South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, with several border crossings available. The most common overland entry points are the Ramatlabama border crossing from South Africa and the Kazungula border crossing from Zambia.

If you're planning to enter Botswana by land, make sure to research the necessary documentation and regulations in advance. Some border crossings may have specific requirements or restrictions, so it's essential to be prepared. Additionally, consider the time of year and weather conditions when planning your trip, as some roads may be impassable during the rainy season.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Botswana has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights within the country. Air Botswana is the national carrier and offers flights between Gaborone, Kasane, Maun, and Francistown. Other airlines, such as Mack Air and Major Blue Air, also operate domestic flights, often focusing on tourist destinations like the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park. When booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to compare prices and schedules across different airlines to find the best option for your needs. Approximate costs for domestic flights in Botswana range from $100 to $300 per person, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Botswana's rail network is limited, with only a few routes available. The main railway line runs from Lobatse to Francistown, with a branch line to Gaborone. However, passenger train services are not well-developed, and most trains are used for freight transport. If you're looking for a scenic and leisurely way to travel, consider taking the train from Lobatse to Francistown, which passes through some of Botswana's most beautiful countryside. However, be aware that train schedules can be unpredictable, and delays are common.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Several bus companies operate in Botswana, offering intercity services between major towns and cities. Companies like Intercape and Eagle Liner provide relatively comfortable and affordable transportation, with fares ranging from $10 to $50 per person, depending on the route and class of service. However, be prepared for long journey times and potentially rough road conditions. Some popular bus routes include Gaborone to Kasane, Gaborone to Maun, and Francistown to Gaborone.
