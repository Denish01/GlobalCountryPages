  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Botswana can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($50 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: BWP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Botswana is relatively well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry winter months when water and electricity demand is higher. The government has implemented measures to stabilize utility costs, but prices can still vary depending on the provider and location. For example, electricity costs can range from $0.10 to $0.20 per kWh, depending on the usage and provider.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Botswana is generally good, with most households having access to modern amenities. However, there can be occasional outages and disruptions, particularly during peak usage periods. The government has invested in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the construction of new power plants and water treatment facilities. Despite these efforts, utility costs can still be a significant expense for households, particularly for low-income families.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | (mostly used for cooking) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill in some areas) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC) |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 50-100 Mbps | Mascom, Orange Botswana |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Mascom, Orange Botswana |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | BTC, Mascom |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | BTC, Mascom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. DSTV, Kwese) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the provider directly and provide proof of residence and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely available and can help households budget their energy usage.\n- The best internet providers in Botswana are Mascom and Orange Botswana, which offer fast and reliable connections.\n- To save on utility bills, households can use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transport or carpool.\n- It is also recommended to compare prices and plans from different providers to find the best deals and promotions.",
