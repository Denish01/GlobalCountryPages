# Best Time to Visit Botswana — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Botswana is during the dry season, from May to October, when the weather is mild and wildlife is easier to spot, making it an ideal time for game viewing and outdoor activities.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Botswana: May to October. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: November to March. Avoid: January and February due to heavy rainfall and high temperatures. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Botswana has a subtropical climate with two distinct seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making it more challenging for travel. The country's climate is also influenced by its geographical location, with the north being generally warmer and more humid than the south. The dry season is the best time for game viewing, as the lack of water sources forces animals to congregate around waterholes, making them easier to spot.

The wet season, on the other hand, is a time of plenty, with abundant water and food sources, allowing animals to disperse and making them more difficult to spot. However, the wet season is also a time of renewal, with lush green landscapes and an abundance of baby animals, making it a great time for birdwatching and photography. The climate varies across different regions of the country, with the Okavango Delta being generally warmer and more humid than the rest of the country.

Botswana's climate is also influenced by its elevation, with the higher areas being cooler than the lower areas. The country's climate zones range from semi-arid to humid, with the north being generally more humid than the south. The dry season is the best time to visit the country's national parks and game reserves, such as Chobe National Park and the Moremi Game Reserve, as the weather is mild and the wildlife is easier to spot.
