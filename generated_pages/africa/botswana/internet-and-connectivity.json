  "content": "The internet in Botswana is relatively well-developed, with a growing number of users and improving speeds, making it possible for tourists and remote workers to stay connected during their stay. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 10 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Good\nMain Carriers: Mascom, Orange, BTC\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Common\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Botswana has seen significant improvements in recent years, with the average internet speed increasing to 10 Mbps download. However, there is still a noticeable divide between urban and rural areas, with cities like Gaborone and Francistown enjoying faster and more reliable connections. In rural areas, internet access can be limited, and speeds are often slower. Despite this, the overall internet quality in Botswana is relatively good, with most users able to access basic online services like email, social media, and news websites.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Botswana can vary depending on the location and the service provider. In general, the mobile network coverage is good, with most areas having access to at least 2G or 3G networks. However, outages and disruptions can occur, especially during periods of heavy usage or maintenance. To mitigate this, many users rely on multiple SIM cards or mobile providers to ensure a stable connection. Additionally, the lack of **5G** coverage in Botswana means that users may not have access to the fastest possible speeds, but this is not a significant concern for most users.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Botswana, tourists can visit the offices of the main mobile carriers, such as Mascom, Orange, or BTC. These carriers offer a range of **prepaid SIM cards** and **data plans** that cater to different needs and budgets. To purchase a SIM card, users typically need to provide a valid passport and proof of address. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans can range from 1-10 USD per day, depending on the carrier and the amount of data required.\n\nThe recommended carriers for tourists are Mascom and Orange, as they offer a wide range of **tourist-friendly plans** and have good coverage throughout the country. For example, Mascom's \"Tourist Plan\" offers 1GB of data per day for 5 USD, while Orange's \"Prepaid Plan\" offers 500MB of data per day for 3 USD. It's worth noting that these plans can change, so it's always a good idea to check with the carrier for the latest options.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mascom | Tourist Plan | 1GB/day | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Orange | Prepaid Plan | 500MB/day | 3 | Valid for 7 days |\n| BTC | Data Bundle | 2GB/week | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Mascom | Monthly Plan | 10GB/month | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality in Botswana is generally good, with most hotels and lodges offering **free WiFi** to their guests.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not as prevalent in Botswana as in other countries, but many cafes and restaurants in urban areas do offer **free WiFi** to customers.\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more popular in Gaborone and other major cities, offering **high-speed WiFi** and other amenities to remote workers and entrepreneurs.\n- Public WiFi is limited in Botswana, but some cities and towns have **public hotspots** that offer free or low-cost internet access.\n- Many **tourist information centers** and **visitor centers** also offer free WiFi to tourists and travelers.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like **The Hive** and **The Workspace** in Gaborone offer **high-speed WiFi**, meeting rooms, and other amenities to remote workers and entrepreneurs.\n- Reliable cafe chains like **Mugg & Bean** and **News Cafe** offer **free WiFi** and a comfortable working environment.\n- Backup internet options like **mobile hotspots** and **portable WiFi routers** are available for purchase or rent in Botswana.\n- VPNs are not strictly necessary in Botswana, but they can be useful for accessing **geo-restricted content** or **secure online services**.\n- Many **hotels and lodges** also offer **conference facilities** and **meeting rooms** with **high-speed WiFi** and other amenities.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a significant concern in Botswana, but some **online services** may be blocked or restricted.\n- **VPN** use is not prohibited in Botswana, but it's always a good idea to check with your carrier or internet service provider before using a VPN.\n- Roaming alternatives like **eSIMs** and **portable WiFi routers** can be useful for travelers who need to stay connected while avoiding high roaming charges.\n- **Public WiFi** networks can be vulnerable to **cyber threats**, so it's always a good idea to use a VPN or other **security measures** when accessing public WiFi.\n- **Power outages** can occur in Botswana, especially in rural areas, so it's always a good idea to have a **backup power source** or **portable charger** on hand.\n- **Data limits** can be a concern in Botswana, especially for heavy users, so it's always a good idea to check your data usage and **data plans** regularly.",
