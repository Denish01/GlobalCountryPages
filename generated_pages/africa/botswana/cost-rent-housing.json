Typical lease terms range from 6 to 24 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the Botswana **Rent Control Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Botswana's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center, due to the country's strong economy and limited supply of housing.\n\nThe housing market in Botswana is also influenced by the country's growing economy and increasing demand for housing, particularly in the capital city of Gaborone. The government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the development of new residential areas and the provision of affordable housing options. However, the demand for housing still outstrips the supply, leading to higher rental prices and property values. In comparison to its neighbors, Botswana's housing costs are higher than those in Namibia and Zambia, but lower than those in South Africa.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$600 | $200-$400 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $500-$1,000 | $300-$600 | fully furnished, secure complex |\n| 2 Bedroom | $800-$1,500 | $500-$1,000 | family-friendly, parking available |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,500 | $800-$1,500 | spacious, modern appliances |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$5,000 | prime locations, commercial areas |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$3,000 | residential areas, amenities nearby |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | limited amenities, scenic views |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Gaborone West**: $800-$1,200 per month for a 2-bedroom apartment, a popular expat neighborhood with modern amenities and secure complexes.\n- **Phakalane**: $500-$900 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, a upscale neighborhood with golf courses and scenic views.\n- **Block 7**: $400-$700 per month for a studio apartment, a vibrant neighborhood with restaurants and shops.\n- **Broadhurst**: $300-$600 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, a residential neighborhood with a mix of old and new housing.\n- **Mogoditshane**: $200-$400 per month for a bedsitter, a bustling neighborhood with a mix of commercial and residential areas.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Botswana [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property.\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition.\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms if possible, but be aware that the **Rent Control Act** regulates rent increases.\n- Be prepared to pay a security deposit and first month's rent upfront.\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget.\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, so clarify the terms with your landlord.",
