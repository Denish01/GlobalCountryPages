        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Botswana has a high-income economy, with a strong focus on mining, tourism, and agriculture. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing economy and a relatively high standard of living. Botswana's economy is classified as an upper-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of over $7,000. The country has a relatively small population, with a total of 2.6 million people, and a diverse economy that is driven by a range of industries. The government has implemented a number of policies aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing its dependence on diamond mining, which has been the mainstay of the economy for many years.</p>
        <p>Botswana's economic development has been driven by a combination of factors, including its natural resources, a stable political environment, and a favorable business climate. The country has a well-developed infrastructure, with good roads, telecommunications, and energy systems. The government has also invested heavily in education and healthcare, which has helped to improve the standard of living and reduce poverty. However, the economy is still vulnerable to external shocks, particularly in the mining sector, and the government is working to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on a single industry.</p>
        <p>The country's economic trajectory is expected to remain positive, with a focus on sustainable development and poverty reduction. The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including the development of a new economic strategy and the establishment of a number of special economic zones. These initiatives are expected to help drive economic growth and reduce poverty, and to promote Botswana's development as a high-income economy.</p>

        <h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
        <p>The economic outlook for Botswana is positive, with the country expected to continue to grow at a steady rate over the next few years. The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including the development of a new economic strategy and the establishment of a number of special economic zones. These initiatives are expected to help drive economic growth and reduce poverty, and to promote Botswana's development as a high-income economy. The country is also expected to benefit from its membership of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which provide access to a large and growing market.</p>
        <p>The government's development priorities include the promotion of economic diversification, the development of the private sector, and the improvement of the business climate. A number of major projects are also being implemented, including the development of a new coal-fired power station and the expansion of the country's rail network. These projects are expected to help drive economic growth and reduce poverty, and to promote Botswana's development as a high-income economy. However, the country still faces a number of challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a reliance on a single industry, and the government will need to continue to work to address these challenges if it is to achieve its development goals.</p>
