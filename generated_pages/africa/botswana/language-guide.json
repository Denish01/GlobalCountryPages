Setswana, also known as Tswana, is the most widely spoken indigenous language and is used as a lingua franca among the various ethnic groups. There are also several regional dialects, including Kalanga and Sekgalagadi, which are spoken in specific areas of the country. English, on the other hand, is widely understood and used in formal settings, such as business, education, and government. It is also the primary language used in tourism, making it relatively easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the country.\n\nThe use of English in Botswana is a legacy of the country's history as a British protectorate, and it has been retained as an official language since independence in 1966. As a result, many Batswana people are fluent in English, and it is commonly used in urban areas and among the educated population. However, in rural areas, Setswana and other indigenous languages are more widely spoken, and visitors may need to use interpreters or learn basic phrases to communicate effectively.\n\nDespite the widespread use of English, there are still many minority languages spoken in Botswana, including languages such as Herero, Mbukushu, and Yei. These languages are spoken by smaller ethnic groups and are an important part of the country's cultural heritage. Visitors who take the time to learn a few basic phrases in these languages can help to build bridges with local communities and enhance their cultural experience.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Dumelang | Doo-meh-lahng | Formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Kae | Kah-eh | Informal |\n| Thank you | Ke a leboga | Kay ah leh-boh-gah | Formal |\n| Please | Tsamma | Chah-mah | Formal |\n| Yes / No | Ee / Nnyaa | Ay / N-yah | Formal |\n| Excuse me | Ntshwarele | N-tswah-reh-leh | Formal |\n| How much? | Kae ke tsenyane | Kah-eh keh tsen-yah-neh | Formal |\n| Where is...? | Kae ke kae | Kah-eh keh kah-eh | Formal |\n| I don't understand | Ga ke na ke utlwa | Gah keh nah keh oo-tluah | Formal |\n| Do you speak English? | O nna le sekgowa | Oh nah leh seh-koh-wah | Formal |\n| Help! | Thuso | Too-soo | Formal |\n| Goodbye | Sala sentle | Sah-lah sehnt-leh | Formal |\n| Sorry | Tsa tsa | Chah chah | Formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Nngwe | N-n-gweh |\n| 2 | Pedi | Peh-dee |\n| 3 | Tharo | Thah-roh |\n| 4 | Nne | N-neh |\n| 5 | Thlano | Thlah-noh |\n| 6 | Thotobolo | Thoh-toh-boh-loh |\n| 7 | Sotlhe | Soh-tleh-eh |\n| 8 | Robedi | Roh-beh-dee |\n| 9 | Robongwe | Roh-boh-n-gweh |\n| 10 | Lesome | Leh-soh-meh |\n| 100 | Lekete | Leh-keh-teh |\n| 1000 | Seketele | Seh-keh-teh-leh |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it is customary to use formal titles such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" and to address older people with respect.\n- Direct eye contact is considered aggressive in some African cultures, so it is best to avoid it when interacting with older people or in formal settings.\n- The use of gestures such as pointing or beckoning with the index finger is considered rude, and it is best to use the whole hand or a nod to communicate.\n- In rural areas, it is customary to remove your shoes before entering a traditional hut or home.\n- When bargaining, it is best to start with a low offer and work your way up, as this is seen as a sign of respect.\n- It is also customary to use both hands when giving or receiving something, as using one hand can be seen as impolite.\n- When communicating with locals, it is best to speak slowly and clearly, and to avoid using slang or colloquialisms.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The Google Translate app is a useful tool for translating Setswana and other languages spoken in Botswana.\n- Phrasebooks and language guides are also available at most bookstores and online.\n- Visitors can also take language classes or hire a local guide to help them communicate with locals.\n- The website of the Botswana Tourism Organization has a useful language guide and phrasebook that can be downloaded for free.\n- The online language learning platform, Duolingo, also has a course in Setswana that can be completed before traveling to Botswana.",
