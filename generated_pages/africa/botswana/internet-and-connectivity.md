[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Botswana has seen significant improvements in recent years, with the average internet speed increasing to 10 Mbps download. However, there is still a noticeable divide between urban and rural areas, with cities like Gaborone and Francistown enjoying faster and more reliable connections. In rural areas, internet access can be limited, and speeds are often slower. Despite this, the overall internet quality in Botswana is relatively good, with most users able to access basic online services like email, social media, and news websites.

The reliability of the internet in Botswana can vary depending on the location and the service provider. In general, the mobile network coverage is good, with most areas having access to at least 2G or 3G networks. However, outages and disruptions can occur, especially during periods of heavy usage or maintenance. To mitigate this, many users rely on multiple SIM cards or mobile providers to ensure a stable connection. Additionally, the lack of **5G** coverage in Botswana means that users may not have access to the fastest possible speeds, but this is not a significant concern for most users.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Botswana, tourists can visit the offices of the main mobile carriers, such as Mascom, Orange, or BTC. These carriers offer a range of **prepaid SIM cards** and **data plans** that cater to different needs and budgets. To purchase a SIM card, users typically need to provide a valid passport and proof of address. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans can range from 1-10 USD per day, depending on the carrier and the amount of data required.

The recommended carriers for tourists are Mascom and Orange, as they offer a wide range of **tourist-friendly plans** and have good coverage throughout the country. For example, Mascom's "Tourist Plan" offers 1GB of data per day for 5 USD, while Orange's "Prepaid Plan" offers 500MB of data per day for 3 USD. It's worth noting that these plans can change, so it's always a good idea to check with the carrier for the latest options.
