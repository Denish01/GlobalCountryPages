[SECTION] Overview: Botswana vs Zambia [/SECTION]
Botswana and Zambia are two neighboring countries in southern Africa, with distinct economic profiles. Botswana has a high-income economy, driven by its rich natural resources, particularly diamonds, while Zambia has a lower-middle-income economy, with a more diversified sector. The cost of living in Botswana is generally higher than in Zambia, due to its stronger economy and higher standard of living. However, Zambia offers a more affordable option for those looking to experience the beauty of Africa without breaking the bank.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Botswana's economy is more stable and diversified, with a strong tourism sector, while Zambia's economy is more dependent on copper exports and is more vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. As a result, Botswana tends to have a more expensive lifestyle, with higher prices for housing, food, and transportation. On the other hand, Zambia offers a more laid-back and affordable lifestyle, with a lower cost of living that is around 20-30% cheaper than Botswana.
