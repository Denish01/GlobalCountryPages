  "content": "The population of Botswana is comprised of approximately 2.6 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a unique and culturally rich country in southern Africa.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 2.6 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 1.7%\nMedian Age: 24.5 years\nUrban Population: 69.4%\nPopulation Density: 4 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 69.3 years\nFertility Rate: 2.9 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nBotswana has a relatively small population, with an estimated 2.6 million people, which is sparse due to the country's large land area of approximately 582,000 km². The population growth rate is moderate, at around 1.7% per annum, which is attributed to a combination of factors including improved healthcare, increased access to education, and economic development. The urban population accounts for nearly 70% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city Gaborone and other major urban centers such as Francistown and Maun. Migration patterns in Botswana are primarily driven by economic factors, with many citizens moving to urban areas in search of employment opportunities. Additionally, the country has a significant number of migrants from neighboring countries, particularly Zimbabwe and South Africa.\n\nThe population of Botswana is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 24.5 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is in the working-age group. Furthermore, the population density is relatively low, at around 4 people per km², which is due to the country's large land area and the fact that much of the population is concentrated in urban areas. The life expectancy at birth is approximately 69.3 years, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe fertility rate in Botswana is around 2.9 children per woman, which is higher than the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. This has significant implications for the country's population growth and development, as a high fertility rate can put pressure on social services and economic resources. However, the government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at reducing the fertility rate and promoting family planning.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tswana | 79% | Southern and southeastern regions | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Kalanga | 11% | Northeastern region | Significant cultural influence |\n| Basarwa | 3% | Western and central regions | Indigenous people |\n| Kgalagadi | 3% | Southern region | Related to the Tswana people |\n| Herero | 1% | Eastern region | Originally from Namibia |\n| Bayeyi | 1% | Northwestern region | Traditionally fishermen and traders |\n| Hambukushu | 1% | Northwestern region | Related to the Herero people |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Botswana are diverse and have a significant impact on the country's cultural landscape.
