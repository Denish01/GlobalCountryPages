[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Botswana has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on private vehicles or **minibus taxis** to get around. The country's large size and sparse population mean that public transportation options are limited, especially in rural areas. However, major cities like Gaborone and Francistown have a more developed transportation network, with city buses and minibus taxis providing affordable and convenient options for commuters.

In terms of quality, public transportation in Botswana is generally **reliable** and **safe**, with most buses and taxis operating on fixed routes and schedules. However, the condition of roads and vehicles can vary, and **traffic congestion** is a common problem in major cities. Despite these challenges, many people in Botswana rely on public transportation to get to work, school, and other destinations, making it an essential part of daily life.
