The country's large size and sparse population mean that public transportation options are limited, especially in rural areas. However, major cities like Gaborone and Francistown have a more developed transportation network, with city buses and minibus taxis providing affordable and convenient options for commuters.\n\nIn terms of quality, public transportation in Botswana is generally **reliable** and **safe**, with most buses and taxis operating on fixed routes and schedules. However, the condition of roads and vehicles can vary, and **traffic congestion** is a common problem in major cities. Despite these challenges, many people in Botswana rely on public transportation to get to work, school, and other destinations, making it an essential part of daily life.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $20 | (good coverage in major cities) |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | (not available) |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | (routes vary by city) |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | (not available) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $0.50 | $10-$20 | |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3 | $0.30 | $5-$15 | (Uber, Bolt) |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | (to city center) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | (economy car) |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$300 | (typical route) |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | (not available) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibus taxis** or **city buses**, which are often cheaper than metered taxis or ride-hailing apps.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Uber or Bolt to get around cities, as they are often more convenient and affordable than traditional taxis.\n- Always **negotiate taxi fares** before you start your journey, as prices can vary depending on the driver and the route.\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** and **road conditions**, especially during peak hours or in rural areas.\n- Consider **renting a car** if you plan to travel long distances or explore rural areas, as public transportation options may be limited.\n- Use **local currency** (BWP) to pay for transportation, as it is often more convenient and affordable than using USD.",
