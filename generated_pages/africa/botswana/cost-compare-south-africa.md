[SECTION] Overview: Botswana vs South Africa [/SECTION]
Botswana and South Africa are two neighboring countries in southern Africa with distinct economic profiles. Botswana has a high-income economy, driven by its diamond mining industry, while South Africa has a more diversified economy with a larger population and a more developed infrastructure. As a result, the cost of living in Botswana is generally higher than in South Africa, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more expensive. However, the difference in costs between the two countries is not drastic, and expats and tourists can still find affordable options in both countries.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a role in determining the cost of living. Botswana's economy is heavily reliant on diamond exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. On the other hand, South Africa's economy is more diversified, with a larger manufacturing sector and a more developed services industry. This diversity can make South Africa's economy more resilient to external shocks, which can in turn affect the cost of living. Overall, while Botswana is more expensive than South Africa, the difference in costs is not significant, and both countries offer a unique experience for visitors and expats.
