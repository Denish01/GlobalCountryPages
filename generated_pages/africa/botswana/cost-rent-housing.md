[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Botswana is relatively stable, with a mix of short-term and long-term lease options available. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 24 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the Botswana **Rent Control Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Botswana's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center, due to the country's strong economy and limited supply of housing.

The housing market in Botswana is also influenced by the country's growing economy and increasing demand for housing, particularly in the capital city of Gaborone. The government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the development of new residential areas and the provision of affordable housing options. However, the demand for housing still outstrips the supply, leading to higher rental prices and property values. In comparison to its neighbors, Botswana's housing costs are higher than those in Namibia and Zambia, but lower than those in South Africa.
