The country has a number of domestic airlines, including Air Botswana, which operates flights to several major towns and cities. The roads in Botswana are generally in good condition, with several major highways and paved roads connecting the main towns and cities. However, driving in Botswana can be challenging, particularly in rural areas, due to the presence of wildlife and poor road conditions. Several bus companies, such as Intercape and Eagle Liner, operate services between the major towns and cities, and are a popular and affordable way to get around.\n\n[CALLOUT] Visitors to Botswana should be aware that driving at night can be hazardous, due to the presence of wildlife on the roads. It is also recommended to use a 4x4 vehicle, particularly when traveling in rural areas, as the roads can be rough and sandy. Additionally, visitors should be aware of the risk of crime, particularly in urban areas, and take necessary precautions to stay safe.",
