Sir Seretse Khama International Airport is the primary hub, with direct flights to Johannesburg, Cape Town, and other regional destinations. You can also enter Botswana overland from neighboring countries, including South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, with several border crossings available. The most common overland entry points are the Ramatlabama border crossing from South Africa and the Kazungula border crossing from Zambia.\n\nIf you're planning to enter Botswana by land, make sure to research the necessary documentation and regulations in advance. Some border crossings may have specific requirements or restrictions, so it's essential to be prepared. Additionally, consider the time of year and weather conditions when planning your trip, as some roads may be impassable during the rainy season.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nBotswana has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights within the country. Air Botswana is the national carrier and offers flights between Gaborone, Kasane, Maun, and Francistown. Other airlines, such as Mack Air and Major Blue Air, also operate domestic flights, often focusing on tourist destinations like the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park. When booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to compare prices and schedules across different airlines to find the best option for your needs.
