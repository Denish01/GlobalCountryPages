[SECTION] Overview: Botswana vs Namibia [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Botswana and Namibia varies significantly, despite both countries being located in Southern Africa. Botswana has a higher GDP per capita and a more stable economy, which contributes to its higher cost of living. The country's strong economy is driven by its diamond mining industry, tourism, and agricultural sector. In contrast, Namibia has a more diverse economy with a stronger focus on mining, manufacturing, and tourism. The overall cost of living in Namibia is lower, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Botswana has a high level of economic development, with a strong focus on infrastructure and public services. This has led to higher prices for housing, food, and transportation. On the other hand, Namibia has a more laid-back economy, with a lower cost of living and a more relaxed pace of life. The difference in cost of living between the two countries is around 10-20%, with Namibia being the cheaper option. However, it's essential to note that prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Gaborone and Windhoek being more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.
