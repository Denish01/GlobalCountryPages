  "content": "The best time to visit Rwanda is during the dry seasons, from June to September and December to February, when the weather is mild and ideal for outdoor activities such as trekking and wildlife watching. \n\n[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Rwanda: June to September and December to February. Peak season: June to September. Budget season: April to May and October to November. Avoid: March to May and September to November due to the heavy rainfall and potential for landslides. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nRwanda has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from June to September and December to February, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from March to May and September to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. Rwanda's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the **Volcanic Virunga Mountains** in the north and the **Albertine Rift** in the west. The country's high altitude, with an average elevation of over 1,000 meters, also contributes to its mild climate.\n\nThe dry seasons are the best time to visit Rwanda's national parks, including **Volcanoes National Park** and **Akagera National Park**, as the weather is ideal for trekking and wildlife watching. The wet seasons, on the other hand, can make roads impassable and outdoor activities more challenging. However, the wet seasons are also a good time to see the country's lush green landscapes and waterfalls at their peak.\n\nRwanda's climate varies across different regions, with the **mountainous regions** in the north and west being cooler than the **low-lying areas** in the east and south. The **Lake Kivu** region in the west has a more moderate climate, with temperatures ranging from 18 to 25 degrees Celsius throughout the year.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Mild and dry | Low | $ | Trekking, wildlife watching |\n| February | Mild and dry | Low | $ | Trekking, wildlife watching |\n| March | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Birdwatching, waterfalls |\n| April | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Birdwatching, waterfalls |\n| May | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Birdwatching, waterfalls |\n| June | Mild and dry | Medium | $$ | Trekking, wildlife watching |\n| July | Mild and dry | High | $$$ | Trekking, wildlife watching |\n| August | Mild and dry | High | $$$ | Trekking, wildlife watching |\n| September | Rainy and humid | Medium | $$ | Birdwatching, waterfalls |\n| October | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Birdwatching, waterfalls |\n| November | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Birdwatching, waterfalls |\n| December | Mild and dry | Medium | $$ | Trekking, wildlife watching |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kwita Izina | June | Gorilla naming ceremony |\n| Umuganura | August | Harvest festival |\n| Rwanda Film Festival | July | Showcase of local and international films |\n| Kigali International Peace Marathon | May | International marathon for peace |\n| Fespaco | February | Pan-African film festival |\n| Rwanda Tourism Chamber Awards | November | Awards for outstanding tourism services |\n| Kigali Jazz Festival | September | Jazz music festival |\n| Rwanda Birding Festival | December | Birdwatching festival |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Volcanic Virunga Mountains** in the north have a cooler climate than the rest of the country, with temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 degrees Celsius.\n- The **Lake Kivu** region in the west has a more moderate climate, with temperatures ranging from 18 to 25 degrees Celsius throughout the year.\n- The **Akagera National Park** in the east has a hot and humid climate, with temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius.\n- The **Nyungwe National Park** in the southwest has a cool and misty climate, with temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 degrees Celsius.\n- The **Kigali** region in the center of the country has a mild climate, with temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 degrees Celsius throughout the year.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to May and October to November, for lower prices and fewer crowds.\n- Pack layers for your trip, as the temperature can drop significantly at night, especially in the **mountainous regions**.\n- Bring a waterproof jacket or umbrella, as sudden rain showers can occur throughout the year.\n- Avoid traveling during the rainy season, from March to May and September to November, if you plan to visit the national parks or engage in outdoor activities.\n- Be respectful of local **holidays and traditions**, such as the **Umuganura** harvest festival, and plan your trip accordingly.",
