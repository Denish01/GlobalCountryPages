[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda has a unique linguistic landscape, with **Kinyarwanda** being the most widely spoken language, understood by nearly the entire population. English and French are also official languages, and are commonly used in business, education, and government. Regional dialects of Kinyarwanda vary across the country, but are generally mutually intelligible. Additionally, there are several minority languages spoken by smaller groups, including **Swahili**, which is widely used in trade and commerce. English is widely understood in urban areas, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry, but proficiency may be limited in rural areas.

The use of English in Rwanda has increased significantly in recent years, particularly since it was adopted as an official language in 2008. This has led to a growing number of English-language schools, universities, and language training centers. However, Kinyarwanda remains the primary language of communication for most Rwandans, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Kinyarwanda are likely to be rewarded with warm hospitality and appreciation.

Rwanda's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the many languages spoken by its neighbors, including **Swahili**, **Lingala**, and **Kirundi**. While these languages are not widely spoken in Rwanda, they may be useful for visitors who plan to travel to neighboring countries or interact with people from those regions.
