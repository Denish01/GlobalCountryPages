[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Rwanda is growing rapidly, driven by the country's strong economic growth, urbanization, and government investment in infrastructure. The market is characterized by a shortage of high-quality housing, particularly in the capital city of Kigali, which has driven up prices in recent years. However, the government has implemented policies to increase the supply of housing, including the development of new housing estates and the renovation of existing buildings. The urban areas, such as Kigali, are more developed and have a higher demand for property, while the rural areas are less developed and have a lower demand.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from apartments to houses and commercial properties. The price trajectory has been upward, with prices increasing by around 10% per annum in recent years. However, the market is still relatively affordable, with prices lower than in many other African countries. The government has also implemented policies to encourage foreign investment in the real estate sector, including the introduction of a **tax-free** period for foreign investors.

This is driven by the country's growing economy and the increasing number of businesses setting up operations in Rwanda.
