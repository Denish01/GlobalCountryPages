The quality of public transit is generally good, with most cities having a reliable bus system. However, the majority of the population relies on **minibuses** and **matatus** (shared taxis) to get around, which are often cheaper and more convenient. The government has also invested in improving the road network, making it easier to travel between cities and towns.\n\nIn Kigali, the capital city, there are several transportation options available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The city has a relatively well-organized public transit system, with buses and minibuses operating on fixed routes. However, traffic congestion can be a problem, especially during peak hours. Outside of Kigali, transportation options may be more limited, and travelers may need to rely on **boda-bodas** (motorcycle taxis) or **matatus** to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$20 | Good coverage in Kigali |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Extensive network, variable prices |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2-$3 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Available in Kigali |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$3 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Yego, SafeMotos available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Kigali city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Kigali to Butare or Gisenyi |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Kigali to Kamembe or Gisenyi |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **matatus**, which are often cheaper than taxis or ride-hailing services.\n- Use reputable ride-hailing apps like Yego or SafeMotos to ensure a safe and reliable ride.\n- Always negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting your journey.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas.\n- Consider renting a car for long-distance travel, as it may be more convenient and cost-effective than public transportation.\n- Download transportation apps like Yego or SafeMotos to book rides and track your journey.",
