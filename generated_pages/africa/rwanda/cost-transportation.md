[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with various modes of transportation available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit is generally good, with most cities having a reliable bus system. However, the majority of the population relies on **minibuses** and **matatus** (shared taxis) to get around, which are often cheaper and more convenient. The government has also invested in improving the road network, making it easier to travel between cities and towns.

In Kigali, the capital city, there are several transportation options available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The city has a relatively well-organized public transit system, with buses and minibuses operating on fixed routes. However, traffic congestion can be a problem, especially during peak hours. Outside of Kigali, transportation options may be more limited, and travelers may need to rely on **boda-bodas** (motorcycle taxis) or **matatus** to get around.
