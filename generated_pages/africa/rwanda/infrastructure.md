# Rwanda Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Rwanda's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with a focus on improving roads, energy, and telecommunications, although there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 34.5% of population
Internet Penetration: 45%
Road Network: 14,836 km, with 1,226 km paved
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 7
Major Ports: landlocked, with access to Tanzanian ports
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has made significant investments in recent years to improve the situation. The country has a **National Strategy for Transformation**, which includes plans to develop infrastructure, increase access to energy and water, and improve transportation networks. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and clean water. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the **Rural Infrastructure Development Program**, which aims to improve access to roads, energy, and water in rural areas.

The government has also invested heavily in **information and communication technology (ICT)** infrastructure, with a focus on improving internet penetration and mobile coverage. This has led to significant growth in the ICT sector, with many international companies setting up operations in Rwanda. Despite these efforts, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need for more investment in energy and transportation infrastructure.

Rwanda's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location in the region, with the country serving as a key transit point for trade between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Tanzania. The government has invested in improving its **logistics and transportation infrastructure**, including the development of a new international airport and the expansion of its road network.
