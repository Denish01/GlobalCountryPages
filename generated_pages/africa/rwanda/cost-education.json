The language of instruction is primarily Kinyarwanda in public schools, while private schools often use English or French. The quality of education in public schools can vary, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers, while private schools generally offer better facilities and instruction. International schools are also available, primarily in Kigali, and offer a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.\n\nThe government of Rwanda has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including increasing access to education and improving the quality of teaching. However, challenges remain, particularly in rural areas where schools often lack resources and infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Rwanda has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with enrollment rates increasing significantly in recent years. The country has also implemented a range of initiatives to improve the quality of education, including teacher training programs and the introduction of new curricula.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary, with some schools lacking resources |\n| Private Primary | $100-$500 | Range depends on school tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $20-$50 (subsidized) | Quality can vary, with some schools lacking resources |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,500 | Range depends on school tier and location |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Curriculum types include British, American, and International Baccalaureate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $200-$500 | $500-$1,000 | University of Rwanda is the largest public university |\n| Private University | $500-$1,500 | $1,000-$2,500 | Kigali Independent University is a popular private option |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | University of Rwanda is ranked as one of the top universities in the country |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$50 | Limited options available, particularly in rural areas |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Popular for students who need extra support |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | English and French language courses are popular |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Costs vary depending on school and grade level |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Required for most schools, with costs varying depending on school and quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The University of Rwanda is considered one of the top universities in the country, with a range of academic programs available.\n- International schools in Kigali offer a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate, and are popular with expat families.\n- Private tutoring is a popular option for students who need extra support, with costs ranging from $10-$20 per hour.\n- Language courses, particularly in English and French, are popular among students and professionals looking to improve their language skills.\n- Online learning options are limited, but some universities and institutions offer online courses and degree programs.\n- The government of Rwanda offers scholarships to students who excel academically, with a range of programs available for both local and international students.",
