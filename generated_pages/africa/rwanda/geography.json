It is situated in the African Great Lakes region, and its borders are shared with four countries: Uganda to the north, Tanzania to the east, Burundi to the south, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. Rwanda is a **landlocked** country, meaning it does not have any direct access to the ocean. However, it is surrounded by several lakes, including Lake Kivu, which is the largest lake in the country.\n\nRwanda's strategic location in the heart of Africa makes it an important hub for trade and commerce. The country's borders are relatively small, with a total length of approximately 893 kilometers. Despite its small size, Rwanda has a diverse geography, with a range of landscapes and climates that support a wide variety of flora and fauna. The country's location near the equator also means that it has a relatively consistent climate throughout the year, with two main seasons: a dry season and a wet season.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nRwanda's terrain is characterized by a mix of **mountains**, **valleys**, and **plains**. The country is often referred to as the \"Land of a Thousand Hills\" due to its rugged terrain, which is dominated by the **Albertine Rift** mountain range. The highest point in Rwanda is Mount Karisimbi, which is located in the **Virunga Mountains** and stands at an elevation of 4,507 meters. The Virunga Mountains are also home to several other notable peaks, including Mount Bisoke and Mount Muhabura.\n\nIn addition to its mountainous terrain, Rwanda is also home to several **rivers** and **lakes**. The country's longest river is the **Kagera River**, which forms part of the border with Tanzania. Rwanda is also home to several **national parks**, including the **Volcanoes National Park**, which is located in the Virunga Mountains and is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including **mountain gorillas**. The country's diverse landscape and climate support a wide range of flora and fauna, making it a popular destination for **ecotourism**.\n\nRwanda's terrain and landscape have also played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture. The country's rugged terrain made it difficult for colonial powers to penetrate, which allowed Rwanda to maintain its independence for longer than many other African countries. Today, Rwanda's unique landscape and culture make it a popular destination for tourists and travelers.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dry Season | June to September | 15-25°C | low | sunny and dry |\n| Wet Season | October to May | 15-25°C | high | rainy and humid |\n| Long Rains | March to May | 15-25°C | very high | heavy rainfall and flooding |\n| Short Rains | October to December | 15-25°C | high | rainy and mild |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: June to September.
