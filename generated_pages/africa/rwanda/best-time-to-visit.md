[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from June to September and December to February, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from March to May and September to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. Rwanda's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the **Volcanic Virunga Mountains** in the north and the **Albertine Rift** in the west. The country's high altitude, with an average elevation of over 1,000 meters, also contributes to its mild climate.

The dry seasons are the best time to visit Rwanda's national parks, including **Volcanoes National Park** and **Akagera National Park**, as the weather is ideal for trekking and wildlife watching. The wet seasons, on the other hand, can make roads impassable and outdoor activities more challenging. However, the wet seasons are also a good time to see the country's lush green landscapes and waterfalls at their peak.

Rwanda's climate varies across different regions, with the **mountainous regions** in the north and west being cooler than the **low-lying areas** in the east and south. The **Lake Kivu** region in the west has a more moderate climate, with temperatures ranging from 18 to 25 degrees Celsius throughout the year.
