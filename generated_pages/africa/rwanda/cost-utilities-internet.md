[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with access to electricity, water, and gas available in most urban areas. However, the quality and reliability of these services can vary depending on the location and provider. The cost of utilities in Rwanda is generally stable, but can fluctuate due to seasonal variation in demand and changes in global fuel prices. For example, during the dry season, the cost of electricity may increase due to reduced hydropower generation, while during the wet season, the cost of water may decrease due to increased rainfall.

The Rwandan government has implemented various initiatives to improve the efficiency and affordability of utility services, including the introduction of prepaid electricity meters and the promotion of renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for many households in Rwanda, particularly those in low-income areas. To mitigate this, many households opt for alternative energy sources, such as charcoal and firewood, which can be more affordable but also pose environmental and health risks.
