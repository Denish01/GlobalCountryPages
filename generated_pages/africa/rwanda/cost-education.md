[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda's education system is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with 12 years of compulsory education. The language of instruction is primarily Kinyarwanda in public schools, while private schools often use English or French. The quality of education in public schools can vary, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers, while private schools generally offer better facilities and instruction. International schools are also available, primarily in Kigali, and offer a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.

The government of Rwanda has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including increasing access to education and improving the quality of teaching. However, challenges remain, particularly in rural areas where schools often lack resources and infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Rwanda has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with enrollment rates increasing significantly in recent years. The country has also implemented a range of initiatives to improve the quality of education, including teacher training programs and the introduction of new curricula.
