The cost of food is driven by factors such as transportation costs, seasonal availability, and import prices. Eating out is not as common in Rwanda as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home using traditional ingredients and recipes. However, there is a growing middle class in urban areas like Kigali, which has led to an increase in the number of restaurants and cafes. The **GDP per capita PPP** of $3,711 in 2024 indicates a growing economy, which may lead to increased food prices in the future.\n\nThe eating-out culture in Rwanda is still developing, with most restaurants catering to tourists and expats. However, there are many local eateries and street food stalls that offer traditional dishes like **umutsima** (a dish made from cassava leaves and peas) and **brochettes** (skewers of marinated meat). These local eateries are generally affordable, with meals starting from around $3 USD. In contrast, mid-range restaurants can be quite expensive, with meals for two people costing around $20 USD. Home cooking is still the norm in Rwanda, with many locals buying ingredients at local markets and cooking traditional meals at home.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 1,300 RWF | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 1,000 RWF | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.50 | 2,100 RWF | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.80 | 1,500 RWF | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 5,000 RWF | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 8,500 RWF | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 2,500 RWF | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 800 RWF | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 600 RWF | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 500 RWF | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 6,800 RWF | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 800 RWF | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Rwanda can be significant, with supermarkets generally being more expensive. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional ingredients at lower prices. It's best to buy staples like **rice**, **beans**, and **vegetables** at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for imported goods like **apples** and **cheese**. Bargaining is a common practice at local markets, so it's worth trying to negotiate prices, especially when buying in bulk.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to learn some basic **Kinyarwanda** phrases, such as \"**Ni mage**\" (how much) and \"**Ntakuka**\" (it's expensive). This can help you negotiate prices and build a relationship with the vendors. Supermarkets, on the other hand, often have fixed prices, so there's no need to bargain. However, it's still worth comparing prices between different supermarkets to find the best deals.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries and street food stalls is a great way to try traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- Buying ingredients at local markets can help you save money and support the local economy.\n- **Umutsima** and **brochettes** are two traditional dishes that are worth trying.\n- Imported goods like **apples** and **cheese** can be expensive, so it's worth considering local alternatives.\n- **Rice** and **beans** are staples in the Rwandan diet and can be bought at local markets at affordable prices.\n- Learning some basic **Kinyarwanda** phrases can help you navigate local markets and negotiate prices.",
