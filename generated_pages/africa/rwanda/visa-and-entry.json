[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nRwanda has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of several countries to enter visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival. The country has been making efforts to improve its tourism infrastructure and attract more visitors, resulting in a relatively straightforward visa application process. Currently, citizens of over 30 countries can enter Rwanda visa-free, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an online application system.\n\nThe Rwandan government has also introduced an **eVisa** system, which allows eligible citizens to apply for a visa online and receive it via email. This system has made it easier for tourists and business travelers to obtain the necessary documentation before arriving in the country. Additionally, Rwanda offers a **visa on arrival** option for citizens of several countries, which can be obtained at Kigali International Airport or other designated entry points.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can also apply for eVisa |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can also apply for eVisa |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can also apply for eVisa |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can also apply for eVisa |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can also apply for eVisa |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can obtain a visa on arrival or apply for an eVisa, which is typically valid for 30 days. The typical stay for tourists is 7-10 days, but extensions can be granted for up to 6 months. To apply for an extension, tourists must visit the immigration office in Kigali and provide proof of onward travel.\n**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may require an invitation letter from a Rwandan company or organization, and must apply for a **business visa**. The requirements for business travelers differ from those for tourists, as they must provide documentation of their business activities and intentions in Rwanda.\n**Students:** Students must provide proof of enrollment in a Rwandan educational institution and apply for a **student visa**. The duration of the visa will depend on the length of the course or program.\n**Workers:** Workers must have a **work permit** and a **work visa**, which are typically sponsored by their employer. The process for obtaining a work permit and visa can be complex, and workers must provide documentation of their qualifications and experience.\n\n[SECTION] Documents Checklist [/SECTION]\n1. Valid passport with at least 6 months' validity\n2. Completed visa application form (if required)\n3. Recent passport-sized photo\n4. Proof of onward travel (e.g. flight itinerary)\n5.

Upon arrival, visitors will need to present their passport, visa (if required), and other documentation to immigration officials. The process is typically straightforward, but visitors should be prepared to answer questions about their purpose of visit, length of stay, and onward travel plans. At land borders, visitors may need to present additional documentation, such as a **carnet de passage** if they are traveling with a vehicle.\n\n[SECTION] Common Mistakes To Avoid [/SECTION]\n- Not having a valid passport with sufficient validity\n- Not having the required documentation (e.g. invitation letter, proof of enrollment)\n- Not applying for the correct type of visa (e.g. tourist vs. business)\n- Not paying the required visa fees\n- Not having proof of onward travel or sufficient funds\n- Not declaring goods or currency at customs and immigration points",
