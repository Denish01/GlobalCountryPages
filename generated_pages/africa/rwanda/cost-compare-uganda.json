  "content": "Rwanda is generally more expensive than Uganda, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nRwanda GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,241\nUganda GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,044\nRwanda Inflation Rate: 4.8%\nUganda Inflation Rate: 3.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Uganda\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Rwanda vs Uganda [/SECTION]\nRwanda and Uganda are two neighboring countries in East Africa, both offering unique cultural and natural experiences. However, when it comes to the cost of living, there are significant differences between the two countries. Rwanda has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which is reflected in its higher prices for goods and services. Uganda, on the other hand, has a more laid-back and affordable lifestyle, making it a popular destination for backpackers and budget travelers. Overall, Uganda is around 15-20% cheaper than Rwanda, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Rwanda has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, which has driven up prices in recent years. Uganda, on the other hand, has a more agriculture-based economy, which has kept prices relatively low. Additionally, Uganda has a larger population and a more competitive market, which has also contributed to lower prices. As a result, expats and travelers who are looking for a more affordable lifestyle may find Uganda to be a better option, while those who are willing to pay a premium for a higher standard of living may prefer Rwanda.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Rwanda (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 250 | 37% cheaper in Uganda |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 150 | 40% cheaper in Uganda |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 37% cheaper in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Rwanda (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 70 | 30% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 2 | 33% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Rwanda (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 0.5 | 50% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1 | 16% cheaper in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Rwanda (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 80 | 20% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Rwanda (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 500 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 800 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,200 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Rwanda is cheaper for:**\n- High-end accommodations and luxury goods\n- International cuisine and fine dining\n- Tourist activities and guided tours\n- **Uganda is cheaper for:**\n- Local transportation and fuel\n- Groceries and everyday essentials\n- Accommodation options for budget travelers\n- Local dining and street food\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Rwanda and Uganda, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle and priorities.
