[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda's housing market is characterized by a growing demand for rental properties, particularly in the capital city of Kigali. The rental market is relatively competitive, with a range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Typical lease terms in Rwanda are for a minimum of six months to a year, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under Rwandan law, with the **Rwandan Housing Authority** responsible for regulating the rental market and resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors, Rwanda's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Uganda but higher than in Burundi.

The government has implemented various initiatives to increase access to affordable housing, including the development of new housing estates and the provision of subsidies for low-income households. However, the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, continues to outstrip supply, driving up prices and rents. Despite this, Rwanda remains an attractive destination for expats and investors, with a growing economy and a **stable** political environment. The country's **strategic location** in the heart of East Africa also makes it an important hub for trade and commerce.
