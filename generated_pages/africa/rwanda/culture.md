# Rwanda Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Rwanda's culture is defined by its rich history, ethnic diversity, and linguistic heritage. The country has a population of over 14 million people, with the majority belonging to the Hutu ethnic group, followed by the Tutsi and Twa ethnic groups. Kinyarwanda is the primary language spoken by the vast majority of Rwandans, with English and French also widely spoken. The country's cultural identity has been shaped by its colonial past, with influences from European, African, and Asian cultures. Rwanda's unique cultural identity is reflected in its traditional music, dance, and art forms, which are an integral part of the country's heritage.

Rwanda's cultural identity is also characterized by its strong sense of community and social cohesion. The concept of **Ubuntu**, which emphasizes the importance of community and mutual respect, is deeply ingrained in Rwandan culture. This is reflected in the country's traditional social structures, such as the **Gacaca** system, which is a community-based justice system that promotes reconciliation and healing. Rwanda's cultural identity is also influenced by its Christian heritage, with the majority of the population practicing Christianity.

Rwanda's cultural diversity is also reflected in its many traditional festivals and celebrations, which showcase the country's rich cultural heritage. The **Intore** dance, for example, is a traditional dance that is performed during special occasions, such as weddings and festivals. The dance is characterized by its energetic and acrobatic movements, which are accompanied by traditional music and singing. Rwanda's cultural identity is a unique blend of traditional and modern influences, which makes it a fascinating and dynamic country to visit.

Eating customs in Rwanda are also an important part of the culture, with mealtimes often being a social occasion.
