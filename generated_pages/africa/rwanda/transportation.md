[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Rwanda is easily accessible by air, with Kigali International Airport (KGL) being the main entry point. The airport is served by several international airlines, including RwandAir, Ethiopian Airlines, and Turkish Airlines, with direct flights to destinations such as Nairobi, Entebbe, and Brussels. You can also enter Rwanda overland from neighboring countries, including Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The main overland entry points are at Gatuna, Cyanika, and Rusumo, where you can cross the border by bus or taxi.

If you're planning to enter Rwanda overland, it's a good idea to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations, as they can change frequently. Additionally, be sure to have all necessary documents, including a valid passport and visa, if required. Rwanda is a member of the East African Community, and citizens of member countries can enter the country using their national ID card or passport.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Rwanda has a limited domestic air network, with flights operated by RwandAir and Akagera Aviation. The main routes are between Kigali and the towns of Kamembe, Gisenyi, and Butare. Domestic flights can be booked online or through a local travel agent, and prices start from around $100 for a one-way ticket. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be subject to change or cancellation due to weather conditions or other factors, so it's a good idea to check with the airline for the latest information.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Rwanda does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. However, there are plans to develop a railway system in the future, which would connect Rwanda to neighboring countries and improve transportation links. In the meantime, buses and taxis are the main modes of public transportation, and car rental is also a popular option for tourists and business travelers.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Rwanda has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity routes. The main bus companies are Volcano Express, Onatracom, and Kigali Bus Services, which operate routes between Kigali and other major towns. Bus fares are relatively affordable, with prices starting from around $5 for a one-way ticket. The buses are generally comfortable and well-maintained, but the roads can be rough in some areas, so be prepared for a bumpy ride.
