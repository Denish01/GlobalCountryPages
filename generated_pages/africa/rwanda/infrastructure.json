  "content": "Rwanda's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with a focus on improving roads, energy, and telecommunications, although there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 34.5% of population\nInternet Penetration: 45%\nRoad Network: 14,836 km, with 1,226 km paved\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 7\nMajor Ports: landlocked, with access to Tanzanian ports\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nRwanda's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has made significant investments in recent years to improve the situation. The country has a **National Strategy for Transformation**, which includes plans to develop infrastructure, increase access to energy and water, and improve transportation networks. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and clean water. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the **Rural Infrastructure Development Program**, which aims to improve access to roads, energy, and water in rural areas.\n\nThe government has also invested heavily in **information and communication technology (ICT)** infrastructure, with a focus on improving internet penetration and mobile coverage. This has led to significant growth in the ICT sector, with many international companies setting up operations in Rwanda. Despite these efforts, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need for more investment in energy and transportation infrastructure.\n\nRwanda's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location in the region, with the country serving as a key transit point for trade between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Tanzania. The government has invested in improving its **logistics and transportation infrastructure**, including the development of a new international airport and the expansion of its road network.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 14,836 km | Moderate | 1,226 km paved, 13,610 km unpaved |\n| Railways | none | - | plans to develop a railway network |\n| Airports | 7 international, 2 domestic | Good | Kigali International Airport is the main hub |\n| Ports | landlocked | - | access to Tanzanian ports via road and rail |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Rwanda's power generation is primarily based on **hydroelectric power**, with several dams located throughout the country.\n- The country aims to increase its electricity access to 100% of the population by 2024, with a focus on **renewable energy sources** such as solar and wind power.\n- Despite progress, the country still experiences **power outages**, particularly during peak demand periods.\n- Rwanda has made significant progress in increasing its **energy independence**, with a focus on reducing its reliance on imported fuel.\n- The government has implemented various initiatives to promote **energy efficiency**, including the use of energy-efficient appliances and lighting.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Rwanda has made significant progress in increasing **access to clean water**, with over 85% of the population having access to improved water sources.\n- However, **sanitation coverage** remains a challenge, with many rural communities lacking access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- The government has implemented various initiatives to improve **water quality**, including the construction of new water treatment plants.\n- Rwanda has also made progress in increasing **access to hygiene facilities**, with a focus on improving handwashing practices and promoting good hygiene habits.\n- Despite progress, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need for more investment in **water infrastructure**, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Rwanda has a relatively high **mobile penetration rate**, with over 80% of the population having access to a mobile phone.\n- The country has also made significant progress in increasing **internet penetration**, with over 45% of the population having access to the internet.\n- Rwanda has invested heavily in **fiber optic infrastructure**, with a focus on improving broadband connectivity.\n- The government has also implemented various initiatives to promote **digital literacy**, including the development of online education platforms and digital skills training programs.\n- Rwanda has also made progress in rolling out **4G/5G networks**, with several mobile operators offering high-speed internet services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched the **Kigali Innovation City** project, which aims to develop a new technology hub in the capital city.\n- Rwanda has also secured funding for the **Central Corridor** project, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure between Rwanda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n- The government has implemented the **Rural Electrification Program**, which aims to increase access to electricity in rural areas.\n- Rwanda has also launched the **Water and Sanitation Program**, which aims to improve access to clean water and sanitation facilities throughout the country.\n- The government has secured funding for the **Transport Sector Development Project**, which aims to improve the country's transportation infrastructure, including roads, airports, and ports.",
