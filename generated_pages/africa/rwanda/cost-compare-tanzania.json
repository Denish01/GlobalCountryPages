Rwanda has a more developed economy, with a strong focus on services and tourism, while Tanzania has a larger and more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector. In terms of cost of living, Rwanda is generally more expensive than Tanzania, with higher prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Tanzania's larger size and more developed infrastructure mean that it offers a wider range of options for shopping, dining, and entertainment.\n\nThe cost of living difference between Rwanda and Tanzania is significant, with Rwanda being around 15-20% more expensive in most categories. This is due to a combination of factors, including Rwanda's smaller size, limited natural resources, and high demand for goods and services. Additionally, Rwanda's government has implemented policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth, which has led to an increase in prices for certain goods and services. In contrast, Tanzania's larger size and more developed economy mean that it has a more competitive market, with lower prices for many goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Rwanda (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $250 | 37% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $250 | $150 | 40% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $800 | $500 | 38% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Rwanda (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $10 | $5 | 50% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $70 | 30% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | $3 | $2 | 33% more expensive |\n| Coffee | $2 | $1.50 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Rwanda (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $10 | 50% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1 | $0.50 | 50% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1.00 | 17% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Rwanda (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $100 | $70 | 30% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $30 | 40% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | $20 | $15 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Rwanda (USD) | Tanzania (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $800 | $600 | 25% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,200 | $900 | 25% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $1,500 | 25% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Rwanda is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and dining options\n- Luxury accommodations and tourist facilities\n- Business and conference services\n- High-speed internet and mobile connectivity\n- **Tanzania is cheaper for:**\n- Basic groceries and household items\n- Local transportation and fuel\n- Budget accommodations and backpacker facilities\n- Traditional crafts and souvenirs\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Tanzania offers better value for money, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Rwanda's more developed economy and higher standard of living make it a more attractive option for those who value convenience, comfort, and luxury. Families may find that Rwanda's safer and more stable environment, as well as its better education and healthcare systems, make it a more desirable choice, despite the higher cost of living. Ultimately, the choice between Rwanda and Tanzania depends on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences. \n\nIn terms of overall value, Tanzania offers a more affordable and authentic African experience, with a wider range of cultural and natural attractions to explore. Rwanda, on the other hand, offers a more modern and efficient lifestyle, with better infrastructure and amenities. By considering these factors and weighing the pros and cons of each country, individuals can make an informed decision about which country best fits their needs and budget.",
