  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Rwanda can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $100 to $200 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($150 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: RWF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nRwanda has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with access to electricity, water, and gas available in most urban areas. However, the quality and reliability of these services can vary depending on the location and provider. The cost of utilities in Rwanda is generally stable, but can fluctuate due to seasonal variation in demand and changes in global fuel prices. For example, during the dry season, the cost of electricity may increase due to reduced hydropower generation, while during the wet season, the cost of water may decrease due to increased rainfall.\n\nThe Rwandan government has implemented various initiatives to improve the efficiency and affordability of utility services, including the introduction of prepaid electricity meters and the promotion of renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for many households in Rwanda, particularly those in low-income areas. To mitigate this, many households opt for alternative energy sources, such as charcoal and firewood, which can be more affordable but also pose environmental and health risks.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in rent) |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$140** | **$205** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | MTN, Airtel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | MTN, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1 GB | MTN, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | MTN, Airtel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-70 | varies | MTN, Airtel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $9.99 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $9.99 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Kwesé TV) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Rwanda, it is recommended to contact the relevant provider (e.g. MTN for electricity, WASAC for water) and provide proof of identity and residence.\n- Prepaid electricity meters can be a cost-effective option for households with variable energy usage, as they allow for real-time monitoring and control of energy consumption.\n- The best internet providers in Rwanda are MTN and Airtel, which offer a range of plans and services to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, reducing water waste, and opting for renewable energy sources.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with landlords or property managers to include utility costs in the rent, as this can help to simplify budgeting and reduce the risk of unexpected expenses.",
