  "content": "The population of Rwanda is approximately 14.1 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that contribute to the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 14.1 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.5%\nMedian Age: 19.5 years\nUrban Population: 17.3%\nPopulation Density: 535 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 65.5 years\nFertility Rate: 4.2 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nRwanda has a relatively small but densely populated territory, with a population that has been growing rapidly over the past few decades. The population size has significant implications for the country's economic development, urbanization, and resource management. The population growth rate is approximately 2.5%, which is higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Rwanda's urban population is relatively small, with about 17.3% of the population living in urban areas, but this proportion is increasing as more people migrate to cities in search of better economic opportunities. The majority of the population, around 82.7%, lives in rural areas and engages in agriculture, which is the mainstay of the economy.\n\nThe population of Rwanda is also characterized by a high median age of 19.5 years, which indicates a relatively young population. This demographic trend has implications for the country's education system, healthcare, and labor market. The population density is approximately 535 people per square kilometer, which is one of the highest in Africa. This density puts pressure on the country's natural resources, infrastructure, and services, particularly in urban areas. Rwanda's life expectancy at birth is around 65.5 years, which is higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The fertility rate is approximately 4.2 children per woman, which is also higher than the average for the region.\n\nRwanda's population has been affected by various factors, including migration patterns, urbanization, and conflict. The country has a significant diaspora community, with many Rwandans living in neighboring countries, Europe, and North America. The diaspora community plays an important role in the country's economy, with remittances from abroad contributing significantly to the national income. However, the country also faces challenges related to migration, including brain drain and the loss of skilled workers to other countries.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hutu | 84% | Throughout the country | Largest ethnic group |\n| Tutsi | 15% | Throughout the country | Second-largest ethnic group |\n| Twa | 1% | Forested areas | Smallest ethnic group, traditionally hunter-gatherers |\n| Hima | 0.5% | Northern regions | Cattle-herding ethnic group |\n| Banyarwanda | 0.5% | Eastern regions | Ethnic group with cultural ties to neighboring countries |\n[/TABLE]\nRwanda's ethnic groups have a complex and sometimes tense relationship, particularly between the Hutu and Tutsi, who have historically been the dominant groups. The Twa, who are the smallest ethnic group, have traditionally been marginalized and excluded from mainstream society. However, the government has implemented policies to promote ethnic reconciliation and inclusivity, particularly since the 1994 genocide, which had a devastating impact on the country's social fabric. Today, Rwanda is a multicultural society with a growing sense of national identity, and efforts are being made to promote unity and cooperation among the different ethnic groups.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Kinyarwanda** is the official language and the most widely spoken language in Rwanda, with around 90% of the population speaking it as their first language.\n- English is the second official language and is widely used in business, education, and government.\n- French is also an official language, although its use has declined in recent years.\n- **Swahili** is a regional language that is widely spoken in East Africa, including Rwanda.\n- Other languages, such as **Lingala** and **Kiswahili**, are also spoken by smaller communities, particularly in urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Christianity | 93.6% | Majority of the population, with Catholics, Protestants, and Anglicans being the main denominations |\n| Islam | 4.6% | Minority religion, with Muslims concentrated in urban areas |\n| Traditional African religions | 1.5% | Animist and ancestral worship practices |\n| Other religions | 0.3% | Including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Baha'i |\n[/TABLE]\nRwanda is a predominantly Christian country, with around 93.6% of the population identifying as Christian. The main Christian denominations are Catholic, Protestant, and Anglican. Islam is the second-largest religion, with around 4.6% of the population identifying as Muslim. Traditional African religions are also practiced, particularly in rural areas, where animist and ancestral worship practices are common. The government promotes religious freedom and tolerance, and interfaith relations are generally good, with different religious groups coexisting peacefully.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 41.3% | High dependency ratio, with significant implications for education and healthcare |\n| 15-24 | 20.5% | Youth population, with potential for economic growth and development |\n| 25-54 | 31.5% | Working-age population, with significant contributions to the economy |\n| 55-64 | 4.2% | Aging population, with implications for social security and healthcare |\n| 65+ | 2.5% | Elderly population, with significant needs for healthcare and social support |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- Rwanda has a relatively small urban population, with around 17.3% of the population living in urban areas.\n- **Kigali**, the capital city, is the largest urban center, with a population of around 1.2 million people.\n- Other major cities include **Butare**, **Gisenyi**, and **Ruhengeri**, which are significant economic and cultural centers.\n- The fastest-growing cities are **Kigali** and **Butare**, which are experiencing rapid urbanization and economic growth.\n- Rwanda's diaspora community is significant, with many Rwandans living in neighboring countries, Europe, and North America, and contributing to the country's economy through remittances.",
