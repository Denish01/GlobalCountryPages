[SECTION] Overview: Rwanda vs Uganda [/SECTION]
Rwanda and Uganda are two neighboring countries in East Africa, both offering unique cultural and natural experiences. However, when it comes to the cost of living, there are significant differences between the two countries. Rwanda has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which is reflected in its higher prices for goods and services. Uganda, on the other hand, has a more laid-back and affordable lifestyle, making it a popular destination for backpackers and budget travelers. Overall, Uganda is around 15-20% cheaper than Rwanda, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Rwanda has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, which has driven up prices in recent years. Uganda, on the other hand, has a more agriculture-based economy, which has kept prices relatively low. Additionally, Uganda has a larger population and a more competitive market, which has also contributed to lower prices. As a result, expats and travelers who are looking for a more affordable lifestyle may find Uganda to be a better option, while those who are willing to pay a premium for a higher standard of living may prefer Rwanda.
