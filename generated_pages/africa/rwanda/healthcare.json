The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country. The quality of care in Rwanda is generally good, with a strong focus on preventive care and community-based health programs. However, there are still significant disparities in access to healthcare between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having limited access to specialized care and advanced medical equipment.\n\nThe Rwandan government has made significant investments in the healthcare sector, including the introduction of a **community-based health insurance** scheme, which has helped to increase access to healthcare for low-income households.

Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Rwanda still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals and limited access to specialized care.\n\nThe healthcare system in Rwanda is also supported by a number of international organizations, including the **World Health Organization** and the **United Nations Children's Fund**. These organizations provide technical assistance, funding, and other forms of support to help strengthen the healthcare system and improve access to healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals &
