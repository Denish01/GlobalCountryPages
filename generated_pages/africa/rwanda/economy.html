        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Rwanda's economy is a lower-middle-income economy, with a strong focus on development and growth. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with a steady increase in GDP and a decline in poverty rates. Rwanda's economic classification is largely driven by its service sector, which accounts for approximately 50% of the country's GDP.

Rwanda's development level is considered to be relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with a strong emphasis on education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.</p>
        <p>Rwanda's economic trajectory is expected to continue on a positive path, with the government implementing various initiatives to promote economic growth and development.
