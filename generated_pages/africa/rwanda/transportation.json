The airport is served by several international airlines, including RwandAir, Ethiopian Airlines, and Turkish Airlines, with direct flights to destinations such as Nairobi, Entebbe, and Brussels. You can also enter Rwanda overland from neighboring countries, including Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The main overland entry points are at Gatuna, Cyanika, and Rusumo, where you can cross the border by bus or taxi.\n\nIf you're planning to enter Rwanda overland, it's a good idea to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations, as they can change frequently. Additionally, be sure to have all necessary documents, including a valid passport and visa, if required. Rwanda is a member of the East African Community, and citizens of member countries can enter the country using their national ID card or passport.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nRwanda has a limited domestic air network, with flights operated by RwandAir and Akagera Aviation. The main routes are between Kigali and the towns of Kamembe, Gisenyi, and Butare. Domestic flights can be booked online or through a local travel agent, and prices start from around $100 for a one-way ticket. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be subject to change or cancellation due to weather conditions or other factors, so it's a good idea to check with the airline for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nRwanda does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. However, there are plans to develop a railway system in the future, which would connect Rwanda to neighboring countries and improve transportation links. In the meantime, buses and taxis are the main modes of public transportation, and car rental is also a popular option for tourists and business travelers.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nRwanda has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity routes. The main bus companies are Volcano Express, Onatracom, and Kigali Bus Services, which operate routes between Kigali and other major towns. Bus fares are relatively affordable, with prices starting from around $5 for a one-way ticket. The buses are generally comfortable and well-maintained, but the roads can be rough in some areas, so be prepared for a bumpy ride.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | None | - | Rwanda does not have a metro system |\n| City Bus | Kigali, Butare | $0.20-$0.50 | Affordable and frequent services |\n| Taxi | Kigali, major towns | $5-$10 | Metered taxis are available, but you can also negotiate the fare |\n| Ride-Hailing | Kigali | $3-$5 | Bolt and Yego are popular ride-hailing apps |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | None | - | Tuk-tuks are not commonly used in Rwanda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Rwanda, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country or an international driving permit.\n- The road conditions in Rwanda are generally good, with many paved roads and scenic routes.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, with petrol prices starting from around $1.20 per liter.\n- Car rental companies are available at Kigali International Airport and in the city center, with prices starting from around $40 per day.\n- When driving in Rwanda, be aware of the **traffic police**, who can be strict about speeding and other traffic offenses.\n- Be prepared for **potholes** and rough roads, especially on rural routes.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced taxi fares or fake tour operators.\n- Use **authorized** taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure your safety.\n- Download the **Bolt** or **Yego** app to book a ride-hailing service.\n- Always **negotiate** the fare before you start your journey, especially with taxi drivers.\n- Keep your **valuables** safe and secure, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Be prepared for **traffic congestion** in Kigali, especially during rush hour.\n- Use a **reputable** car rental company to ensure you get a well-maintained vehicle.\n- Always wear a **seatbelt** and follow **traffic rules** to ensure your safety on the road.",
