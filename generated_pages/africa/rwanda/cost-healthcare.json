  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Rwanda can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private healthcare services, with public services generally being more affordable but often with longer wait times and less availability of specialized care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $53 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 4.1% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: RWF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nRwanda has a mixed healthcare system, which includes both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable and accessible to the local population, with most healthcare services being subsidized by the government. However, the private healthcare system is often preferred by foreigners and those who can afford it, as it offers higher quality care and shorter wait times. The healthcare system in Rwanda is designed to provide universal access to healthcare services, with a strong emphasis on primary healthcare and preventive care. For locals, the healthcare system is generally affordable, with most healthcare services being subsidized by the government. However, for foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in Rwanda, as medical costs can be high, especially in private hospitals.\n\nThe healthcare system in Rwanda is also supported by a network of community health workers, who provide basic healthcare services and refer patients to higher-level healthcare facilities when necessary. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities. However, despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Rwanda still faces a number of challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals and limited access to specialized care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may have more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private dental clinics may have more advanced equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$30 | Private eye clinics may have more advanced technology |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private labs may have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may have more comfortable facilities |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$300 | Private hospitals may have more advanced equipment |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Private hospitals may have more advanced technology |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Private hospitals may have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers more advanced medical services, including specialist consultations and surgery |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers medical services, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medication** is generally available at pharmacies and hospitals, with prices ranging from $5-$20 for basic medications.\n- **Over-the-counter medication** is also widely available, with prices ranging from $2-$10.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good, with many pharmacies located in urban areas.\n- **Prescription rules** are generally strict, with most medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- **Common medication prices** include $5-$10 for antibiotics, $10-$20 for painkillers, and $20-$50 for more advanced medications.\n- **Vaccinations** are also available at pharmacies and hospitals, with prices ranging from $10-$50.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112 or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. **Ambulance services** are generally available, but may not be widely available in rural areas.
