Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 13, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for 6 years, and the second cycle, also known as **Tronc Commun**, lasts for 3 years. Secondary education, also compulsory, is divided into two parts: lower secondary, which lasts for 3 years, and upper secondary, which lasts for 3 years. Tertiary education is provided by universities, polytechnics, and other institutions, offering a range of academic and vocational programs. The quality of education in Rwanda has improved significantly in recent years, with a strong focus on teacher training, curriculum development, and infrastructure improvement. While public schools are the most common, private schools are also available, offering alternative options for students who can afford them.\n\nThe Rwandan government has made significant efforts to improve the quality of education, with a focus on increasing access to education, particularly for disadvantaged groups. This has led to a significant increase in enrollment rates, particularly at the primary level. However, challenges still remain, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, Rwanda has made significant progress in improving its education system, and it continues to be a priority area for the government.\n\nThe education system in Rwanda is also characterized by a strong emphasis on **vocational training**, with a focus on developing skills that are relevant to the labor market. This has led to the establishment of a number of vocational training centers and polytechnics, which offer programs in areas such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality. These programs are designed to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce, and they have been highly successful in reducing unemployment rates among young people.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
