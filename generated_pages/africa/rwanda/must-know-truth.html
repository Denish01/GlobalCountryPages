        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Rwanda is a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in the eastern part of the African continent. The country has a rich and complex history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the <strong>Stone Age</strong>. The <strong>Twa</strong>, <strong>Hutu</strong>, and <strong>Tutsi</strong> peoples are the three main ethnic groups that have traditionally inhabited the region. In 1885, Rwanda became a <strong>German colony</strong>, known as German Ruanda, as part of German East Africa. Following Germany's defeat in World War I, Rwanda was mandated to <strong>Belgium</strong> by the League of Nations in 1918. Rwanda gained its <strong>independence</strong> from Belgium on July 1, 1962.</p>
        <p>The early years of independence were marked by <strong>ethnic tensions</strong> between the Hutu and Tutsi populations, which ultimately led to the <strong>Rwandan Genocide</strong> in 1994. The genocide resulted in the deaths of an estimated 800,000 people, primarily from the Tutsi ethnic group, and had a profound impact on the country's social and economic fabric. In the aftermath of the genocide, Rwanda has made significant progress in rebuilding and recovering, with a focus on <strong>economic development</strong> and <strong>social reconciliation</strong>.</p>
        <p>Rwanda's <strong>founding</strong> as a modern nation-state is closely tied to its colonial history. The country's <strong>colonization</strong> by Germany and later Belgium had a profound impact on its language, culture, and politics. The legacy of colonialism can still be seen in Rwanda's <strong>language</strong> and <strong>education system</strong>, with <strong>Kinyarwanda</strong>, <strong>English</strong>, and <strong>French</strong> being the official languages. Rwanda's <strong>currency</strong>, the Rwandan franc (RWF), was introduced in 1964, replacing the Belgian Congo franc.</p>
        <p>Rwanda's <strong>independence timeline</strong> is marked by several key events, including the country's independence from Belgium in 1962, the establishment of a <strong>republic</strong> in 1962, and the adoption of a new <strong>constitution</strong> in 2003. Today, Rwanda is a <strong>presidential republic</strong>, with a <strong>president</strong> serving as head of state and government. The country has a <strong>unicameral legislature</strong>, known as the <strong>Chamber of Deputies</strong>, which is composed of 80 members elected by <strong>proportional representation</strong>.</p>
