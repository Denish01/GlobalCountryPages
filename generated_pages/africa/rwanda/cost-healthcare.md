[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda has a mixed healthcare system, which includes both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable and accessible to the local population, with most healthcare services being subsidized by the government. However, the private healthcare system is often preferred by foreigners and those who can afford it, as it offers higher quality care and shorter wait times. The healthcare system in Rwanda is designed to provide universal access to healthcare services, with a strong emphasis on primary healthcare and preventive care. For locals, the healthcare system is generally affordable, with most healthcare services being subsidized by the government. However, for foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in Rwanda, as medical costs can be high, especially in private hospitals.

The healthcare system in Rwanda is also supported by a network of community health workers, who provide basic healthcare services and refer patients to higher-level healthcare facilities when necessary. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities. However, despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Rwanda still faces a number of challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals and limited access to specialized care.
