  "content": "The primary language spoken in Rwanda is **Kinyarwanda**, but English and French are also widely used as official languages.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Kinyarwanda, English, French\nWidely Spoken: Swahili, other local dialects\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Bantu\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nRwanda has a unique linguistic landscape, with **Kinyarwanda** being the most widely spoken language, understood by nearly the entire population. English and French are also official languages, and are commonly used in business, education, and government. Regional dialects of Kinyarwanda vary across the country, but are generally mutually intelligible. Additionally, there are several minority languages spoken by smaller groups, including **Swahili**, which is widely used in trade and commerce. English is widely understood in urban areas, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry, but proficiency may be limited in rural areas.\n\nThe use of English in Rwanda has increased significantly in recent years, particularly since it was adopted as an official language in 2008. This has led to a growing number of English-language schools, universities, and language training centers. However, Kinyarwanda remains the primary language of communication for most Rwandans, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Kinyarwanda are likely to be rewarded with warm hospitality and appreciation.\n\nRwanda's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the many languages spoken by its neighbors, including **Swahili**, **Lingala**, and **Kirundi**. While these languages are not widely spoken in Rwanda, they may be useful for visitors who plan to travel to neighboring countries or interact with people from those regions.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Amagara | Ah-mah-gah-rah | Formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Jambo | Jahm-boh | Informal |\n| Thank you | Murakoze | Moo-rah-koh-zeh | Formal |\n| Please | Furaha | Foo-rah-hah | Formal |\n| Yes / No | Yego / Oya | Yeh-goh / Oh-yah | Formal |\n| Excuse me | Ndakuza | N-dah-koo-zah | Formal |\n| How much? | Ni iki? | Nee ee-kee | Formal |\n| Where is...? | Aho iki? | Ah-hoh ee-kee | Formal |\n| I don't understand | Sibyo nshaka | See-byo n-shah-kah | Formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Uvuga icyongereza? | Oo-voo-gah ee-choh-ng-reh-zah | Formal |\n| Help! | Baramuka | Bah-rah-moo-kah | Formal |\n| Goodbye | Murabeho | Moo-rah-beh-hoh | Formal |\n| Sorry | Mpole | M-poh-leh | Formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Rimwe | Ree-mweh |\n| 2 | Kabiri | Kah-bee-ree |\n| 3 | Gatatu | Gah-tah-too |\n| 4 | Kana | Kah-nah |\n| 5 | Gatanu | Gah-tah-noo |\n| 6 | Gatandatu | Gah-tah-nah-too |\n| 7 | Karindwi | Kah-rin-dwee |\n| 8 | Umanye | Oo-mah-nyeh |\n| 9 | Icyenda | Ee-chen-dah |\n| 10 | Icumi | Ee-choo-mee |\n| 100 | Magana | Mah-gah-nah |\n| 1000 | Igihumbi | Ee-gee-hoo-mbee |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when interacting with older Rwandans or in formal settings.\n- Use formal language and titles, such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\", when addressing older or more senior individuals.\n- Avoid using gestures or body language that may be considered impolite, such as pointing with the left hand or touching someone's head.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Kinyarwanda, such as \"hello\" and \"thank you\", to show appreciation for the local culture.\n- Be patient and polite when communicating, as Rwandans tend to value respect and courtesy in interactions.\n- Use a calm and respectful tone of voice, avoiding loud or aggressive speech.\n- Avoid discussing sensitive topics, such as politics or ethnicity, in public or with people you do not know well.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication in Kinyarwanda and other local languages.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary, particularly if you plan to travel to rural areas or interact with locals who may not speak English.\n- Take a language course or work with a tutor to learn basic phrases and grammar in Kinyarwanda.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites or YouTube channels, to practice your language skills and learn more about Rwandan culture.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or interpreter, particularly if you plan to visit rural areas or engage in complex negotiations or business transactions.",
