As a result, internet speeds are generally good, with an average download speed of 10 Mbps, although this can vary depending on the location and time of day. The urban-rural divide is still evident, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in cities like Kigali, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall quality of the internet in Rwanda is relatively good, with most users able to access a range of online services, including social media, email, and streaming platforms.\n\nHowever, the reliability of the internet in Rwanda can be affected by various factors, including power outages, network maintenance, and high usage during peak hours. Additionally, the country's internet infrastructure is still largely dependent on fiber-optic cables, which can be prone to damage and disruption. Nevertheless, the government and mobile network operators are working to improve the resilience and redundancy of the internet infrastructure, with efforts to expand fiber-optic coverage and deploy backup systems to ensure more reliable connections.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Rwanda is a relatively straightforward process, with a range of options available for tourists and visitors. The most convenient place to buy a SIM card is at the airport, where you can find booths and kiosks operated by the main mobile network carriers, including MTN, Airtel, and Tigo. You will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some carriers may also require a copy of your visa or other documentation. Once you have purchased your SIM card, you can top up your account with credit at a range of outlets, including convenience stores, pharmacies, and street vendors.\n\nThe main carriers in Rwanda offer a range of data plans and packages, with prices starting from around 5 USD for a basic tourist SIM. These plans typically include a set amount of data, voice minutes, and SMS, with options to top up or upgrade to a more comprehensive plan as needed. It's worth noting that some carriers may offer special promotions or discounts for tourists, so it's worth shopping around to find the best deal.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MTN | Tourist Bundle | 1GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Airtel | Visitor Pack | 500MB | 5 | Valid for 3 days |\n| Tigo | Rwanda Tourist | 2GB | 15 | Valid for 14 days |\n| MTN | Data Bundle | 5GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most mid-range and luxury hotels offering fast and reliable connections\n- Cafe WiFi culture is growing in popularity, with many coffee shops and restaurants offering free or low-cost WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular in Kigali, with many offering high-speed WiFi and other amenities to remote workers and entrepreneurs\n- Public WiFi is available in some areas, including airports, shopping malls, and public parks, although the quality and reliability of these connections can vary\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer WiFi, although the speed and reliability can vary depending on the location and time of day\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like KLab, The Office, and Westerwelle Startup Haus offer reliable and high-speed WiFi, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and networking events\n- Reliable cafe chains like Bourbon Coffee and Café Neo offer good WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and portable WiFi routers can be useful in case of power outages or network disruptions\n- VPNs can be necessary to access certain websites and services that may be blocked or restricted in Rwanda\n- Online communities and networking groups, such as Nomad List and Remote Year, can provide valuable resources and support for remote workers in Rwanda\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Rwanda, with some websites and services blocked or restricted by the government\n- Blocked sites may include certain news outlets, social media platforms, and online services, so it's a good idea to use a VPN to access these sites\n- Roaming alternatives like portable WiFi routers and mobile hotspots can be a cost-effective option for staying connected while traveling in Rwanda\n- eSIM options are becoming increasingly available, with some carriers offering eSIM plans and packages for tourists and visitors\n- It's a good idea to purchase a local SIM card or portable WiFi router rather than relying on roaming services, which can be expensive and unreliable\n- Be aware of your data usage and top up your account regularly to avoid running out of credit or incurring unexpected charges",
