Rwanda and Tanzania are two East African countries with distinct economic profiles. Rwanda has a more developed economy, with a strong focus on services and tourism, while Tanzania has a larger and more diversified economy, with a strong agricultural sector. In terms of cost of living, Rwanda is generally more expensive than Tanzania, with higher prices for housing, food, and transportation.

The cost of living difference between Rwanda and Tanzania is significant, with Rwanda being around 15-20% more expensive in most categories.
