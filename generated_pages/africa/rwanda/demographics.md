[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Rwanda has a relatively small but densely populated territory, with a population that has been growing rapidly over the past few decades. The population size has significant implications for the country's economic development, urbanization, and resource management. The population growth rate is approximately 2.5%, which is higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Rwanda's urban population is relatively small, with about 17.3% of the population living in urban areas, but this proportion is increasing as more people migrate to cities in search of better economic opportunities. The majority of the population, around 82.7%, lives in rural areas and engages in agriculture, which is the mainstay of the economy.

The population of Rwanda is also characterized by a high median age of 19.5 years, which indicates a relatively young population. This demographic trend has implications for the country's education system, healthcare, and labor market. The population density is approximately 535 people per square kilometer, which is one of the highest in Africa. This density puts pressure on the country's natural resources, infrastructure, and services, particularly in urban areas. Rwanda's life expectancy at birth is around 65.5 years, which is higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The fertility rate is approximately 4.2 children per woman, which is also higher than the average for the region.

Rwanda's population has been affected by various factors, including migration patterns, urbanization, and conflict. The country has a significant diaspora community, with many Rwandans living in neighboring countries, Europe, and North America. The diaspora community plays an important role in the country's economy, with remittances from abroad contributing significantly to the national income. However, the country also faces challenges related to migration, including brain drain and the loss of skilled workers to other countries.

[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]
[TABLE]
| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hutu | 84% | Throughout the country | Largest ethnic group |
| Tutsi | 15% | Throughout the country | Second-largest ethnic group |
| Twa | 1% | Forested areas | Smallest ethnic group, traditionally hunter-gatherers |
| Hima | 0.5% | Northern regions | Cattle-herding ethnic group |
| Banyarwanda | 0.5% | Eastern regions | Ethnic group with cultural ties to neighboring countries |
[/TABLE]
Rwanda's ethnic groups have a complex and sometimes tense relationship, particularly between the Hutu and Tutsi, who have historically been the dominant groups. The Twa, who are the smallest ethnic group, have traditionally been marginalized and excluded from mainstream society. However, the government has implemented policies to promote ethnic reconciliation and inclusivity, particularly since the 1994 genocide, which had a devastating impact on the country's social fabric. Today, Rwanda is a multicultural society with a growing sense of national identity, and efforts are being made to promote unity and cooperation among the different ethnic groups.
