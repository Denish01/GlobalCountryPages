# The Truth About Rwanda - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Rwanda is a **sovereign** country located in the eastern part of the African continent. The country has a rich and complex history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the **Stone Age**. The **Twa**, **Hutu**, and **Tutsi** peoples are the three main ethnic groups that have traditionally inhabited the region. In 1885, Rwanda became a **German colony**, known as German Ruanda, as part of German East Africa. Following Germany's defeat in World War I, Rwanda was mandated to **Belgium** by the League of Nations in 1918. Rwanda gained its **independence** from Belgium on July 1, 1962.

The early years of independence were marked by **ethnic tensions** between the Hutu and Tutsi populations, which ultimately led to the **Rwandan Genocide** in 1994. The genocide resulted in the deaths of an estimated 800,000 people, primarily from the Tutsi ethnic group, and had a profound impact on the country's social and economic fabric. In the aftermath of the genocide, Rwanda has made significant progress in rebuilding and recovering, with a focus on **economic development** and **social reconciliation**.

Rwanda's **founding** as a modern nation-state is closely tied to its colonial history. The country's **colonization** by Germany and later Belgium had a profound impact on its language, culture, and politics. The legacy of colonialism can still be seen in Rwanda's **language** and **education system**, with **Kinyarwanda**, **English**, and **French** being the official languages. Rwanda's **currency**, the Rwandan franc (RWF), was introduced in 1964, replacing the Belgian Congo franc.

Rwanda's **independence timeline** is marked by several key events, including the country's independence from Belgium in 1962, the establishment of a **republic** in 1962, and the adoption of a new **constitution** in 2003. Today, Rwanda is a **presidential republic**, with a **president** serving as head of state and government. The country has a **unicameral legislature**, known as the **Chamber of Deputies**, which is composed of 80 members elected by **proportional representation**.
