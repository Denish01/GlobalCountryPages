[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Rwanda has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with the country investing heavily in its telecommunications infrastructure. As a result, internet speeds are generally good, with an average download speed of 10 Mbps, although this can vary depending on the location and time of day. The urban-rural divide is still evident, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in cities like Kigali, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall quality of the internet in Rwanda is relatively good, with most users able to access a range of online services, including social media, email, and streaming platforms.

However, the reliability of the internet in Rwanda can be affected by various factors, including power outages, network maintenance, and high usage during peak hours. Additionally, the country's internet infrastructure is still largely dependent on fiber-optic cables, which can be prone to damage and disruption. Nevertheless, the government and mobile network operators are working to improve the resilience and redundancy of the internet infrastructure, with efforts to expand fiber-optic coverage and deploy backup systems to ensure more reliable connections.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Rwanda is a relatively straightforward process, with a range of options available for tourists and visitors. The most convenient place to buy a SIM card is at the airport, where you can find booths and kiosks operated by the main mobile network carriers, including MTN, Airtel, and Tigo. You will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some carriers may also require a copy of your visa or other documentation. Once you have purchased your SIM card, you can top up your account with credit at a range of outlets, including convenience stores, pharmacies, and street vendors.

The main carriers in Rwanda offer a range of data plans and packages, with prices starting from around 5 USD for a basic tourist SIM. These plans typically include a set amount of data, voice minutes, and SMS, with options to top up or upgrade to a more comprehensive plan as needed. It's worth noting that some carriers may offer special promotions or discounts for tourists, so it's worth shopping around to find the best deal.
