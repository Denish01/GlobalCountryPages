[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Niger operates under a semi-presidential system, where the **President** serves as the head of state and the **Prime Minister** is the head of government. This system aims to balance the powers between the two, with the President holding significant influence over foreign and defense policies, and the Prime Minister responsible for domestic and economic affairs. The separation of powers is further reinforced by an independent **judiciary** that oversees the application of the law. Niger's political system is also characterized by a unicameral legislature, known as the **National Assembly**, which is composed of 171 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term.

The government of Niger has faced numerous challenges in maintaining stability and security, particularly in the face of terrorist threats from neighboring countries. Despite these challenges, the country has made significant progress in consolidating its democratic institutions and promoting economic development. The **Constitution** of Niger, adopted in 2010, provides the framework for the country's governance and outlines the principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.

Niger's political system has been marked by periods of instability and military intervention, but the country has made significant progress in recent years in consolidating its democratic institutions and promoting economic development. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving governance, reducing corruption, and promoting transparency. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including poverty, inequality, and insecurity, which continue to pose significant threats to its stability and development.
