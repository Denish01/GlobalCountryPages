[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Niger's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, while private facilities tend to offer better quality care but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. Insurance is not required, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical care can be expensive and unpredictable.

The healthcare system in Niger is also heavily reliant on foreign aid and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide essential services, particularly in rural areas. As a result, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific facility. In general, public facilities are overcrowded and under-resourced, while private facilities are more modern and well-equipped. However, even in private facilities, the quality of care can be inconsistent, and medical errors are not uncommon.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call for an ambulance or seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital. The emergency number in Niger is 15 or 17, but response times can be slow, and ambulances may not always be available. For foreigners, it's often best to seek care at a private facility, as they tend to have better equipment and more experienced staff. The best hospitals for foreigners in Niger include the **Hôpital National de Niamey** and the **Clinique Pasteur**, both of which offer a range of medical services and have experience treating international patients.

In the event of a serious medical emergency, it may be necessary to evacuate to a nearby country or to Europe for treatment. This can be expensive and logistically challenging, which is why it's essential to have adequate health insurance coverage before traveling to Niger. Additionally, it's a good idea to research local medical facilities and emergency services before arriving in the country, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. By taking these precautions, travelers can minimize their risk and ensure that they receive the best possible care in the event of a medical emergency.
