[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Niger are generally higher than the regional average due to the country's landlocked location and limited agricultural production, which drives up the cost of imports. The **inflation rate** of 9.1% in 2024 also contributes to the increasing cost of food, making it challenging for locals to afford basic staples. Despite these challenges, the eating-out culture is not very prevalent in Niger, with most people preferring to cook at home, where a meal can cost significantly less than eating out.

The cost of food in Niger is also influenced by the **seasonality** of produce, with prices fluctuating depending on the time of year and availability of certain items. For example, during the dry season, the cost of fresh produce can increase significantly due to the limited supply. Additionally, the **GDP per capita** of $2,050 in 2024 indicates that many Nigeriens have limited disposable income, making it essential to find affordable food options.
