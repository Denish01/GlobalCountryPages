[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Niger has a **subtropical** climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which lasts from October to May, is characterized by dry and hot weather, with very little rainfall. The wet season, which occurs from June to September, brings much-needed rain to the country, but also makes traveling more challenging due to flooded roads and increased humidity. The dry season is generally the best time to visit Niger, as the weather is more pleasant and ideal for exploring the country's natural and cultural attractions.

The country can be divided into several **climate zones**, each with its unique characteristics. The Sahara Desert covers much of the north, while the Sahel region in the south is more temperate. The **Niger River**, which runs through the country, also plays a significant role in shaping the local climate. Understanding these climate zones is essential for planning a trip to Niger, as they can greatly impact travel plans and activities.

The seasons in Niger also affect the **travel experience**. During the dry season, the weather is generally clear, and the roads are more accessible, making it easier to explore the country. However, the heat can be intense, especially in the north. During the wet season, the rain can make traveling more challenging, but the scenery is more lush and green, and the temperatures are slightly cooler.
