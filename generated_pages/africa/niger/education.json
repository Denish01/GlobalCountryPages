The system is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory, is provided to children between the ages of 6 and 12, and is designed to provide students with basic skills in reading, writing, and mathematics. Secondary education, which is not compulsory, is provided to students between the ages of 13 and 18, and is designed to provide students with more advanced skills in a range of subjects, including science, technology, and languages. Tertiary education is provided to students who have completed secondary education, and is designed to provide students with specialized skills and knowledge in a range of fields, including medicine, engineering, and law.\n\nThe quality of education in Niger is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic resources, such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. According to UNESCO, the country has a **high dropout rate**, with many students failing to complete their education due to poverty, lack of access to schools, and other factors. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding for education and implementing new policies to improve the quality of teaching and learning.\n\nPublic education is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, but many families are unable to afford the costs of sending their children to school, including the cost of uniforms, textbooks, and transportation.
