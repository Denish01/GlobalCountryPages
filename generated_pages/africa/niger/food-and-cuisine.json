The cuisine is also influenced by the country's **French** colonial past, as well as **Arabic** and **Haussa** traditions. In rural areas, meals are often simple and based on traditional ingredients, while in urban centers, such as **Niamey**, a wider variety of dishes and international cuisine can be found. Regional variations exist, with the **Air Mountains** region known for its unique **Tuareg** cuisine, which features dishes such as **taguella**, a type of flatbread.\n\nThe country's cuisine is also shaped by its **Islamic** heritage, with many dishes being **halal**, or permissible under Islamic law. This means that pork and other non-halal meats are rarely consumed, and **vegetarian** options are widely available. In addition, the country's cuisine has been influenced by its **West African** neighbors, such as **Mali** and **Nigeria**, with dishes such as **jollof rice** and **fufu** being popular.\n\nNiger's food culture is also closely tied to its social and cultural traditions, with meals often being seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds. In rural areas, meals are often eaten from a communal bowl, using the **right hand** only, as the **left hand** is considered unclean. This emphasis on community and hospitality is a key aspect of Niger's food culture, and visitors are often warmly welcomed and invited to share meals with locals.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thieboudienne | National Dish | Hearty fish and rice dish | Niamey restaurants |\n| Taguella | Flatbread | Traditional Tuareg flatbread | Air Mountains region |\n| Mafé | Stew | Rich meat stew made with peanuts and vegetables | Urban restaurants |\n| Yassa | Grilled Meat | Grilled meat dish marinated in spices and onions | Street food stalls |\n| Jollof Rice | One-Pot Dish | Spicy rice dish made with tomatoes and meat or fish | Urban restaurants |\n| Fufu | Staple Food | Boiled and pounded cassava or yams | Rural areas |\n| Dambou | Porridge | Thick and flavorful porridge made from millet or sorghum | Rural areas |\n| Kilishi | Snack | Thinly sliced and dried meat snack | Street food stalls |\n| Akara | Snack | Fried bean cake snack | Street food stalls |\n| Sosatie | Skewers | Grilled meat skewers made with beef or chicken | Street food stalls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Kilishi**: a thinly sliced and dried meat snack, typically made from beef or goat meat, priced around $1-2 USD\n- **Akara**: a fried bean cake snack, often served with a spicy sauce, priced around $0.50-1 USD\n- **Sosatie**: grilled meat skewers made with beef or chicken, priced around $2-3 USD\n- **Yassa**: a grilled meat dish marinated in spices and onions, priced around $3-5 USD\n- **Maafe**: a rich meat stew made with peanuts and vegetables, priced around $5-7 USD\n- **Doughnuts**: a sweet fried dough snack, often coated in sugar, priced around $0.50-1 USD\n- **Plantain Chips**: thinly sliced and fried plantain snack, priced around $1-2 USD\n- **Groundnut**: roasted peanuts, often seasoned with salt and spices, priced around $1-2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Tea**: a strong and sweet black tea, often served with milk and sugar\n- **Coffee**: a strong and rich coffee, often served in small cups\n- **Fresh Juice**: a variety of fresh juices, such as orange, mango, and pineapple\n- **Bissap**: a sweet and tangy hibiscus drink, often served cold\n- **Degue**: a sweet and creamy millet drink, often served at special occasions\n- **Flag Beer**: a local beer, brewed in Niger, often served cold\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Right Hand**: always use the right hand when eating, as the left hand is considered unclean\n- **Communal Eating**: meals are often eaten from a communal bowl, with everyone sharing\n- **Hospitality**: visitors are often warmly welcomed and invited to share meals with locals\n- **Tipping**: 5-10% of the total bill is customary in restaurants\n- **Dress Code**: modest dress is recommended, especially when eating in rural areas or at traditional restaurants\n- **Reservation**: reservations are not always necessary, but can be helpful, especially in urban restaurants\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Markets**: bustling markets, such as the **Niamey Grand Marche**, offer a wide variety of street food and snacks\n- **Food Courts**: urban food courts, such as the **Niamey Food Court**, offer a range of local and international cuisine\n- **Restaurants**: traditional restaurants, such as the **Restaurant Le Sahel**, offer a range of local dishes and specialties\n- **Street Food Stalls**: street food stalls, such as those found in the **Niamey streets**, offer a range of snacks and light meals\n- **Local Homes**: visitors are often invited to share meals with locals, which can be a unique and memorable experience\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Niamey Grand Marche**: a bustling market offering a wide variety of street food and snacks, located in the heart of Niamey\n- **Niamey Food Court**: an urban food court offering a range of local and international cuisine, located in the Niamey city center\n- **Air Mountains Market**: a traditional market offering a range of local ingredients and specialties, located in the Air Mountains region\n- **Tuareg Cultural Festival**: a cultural festival celebrating Tuareg traditions and cuisine, held annually in the Air Mountains region\n- **Nigerien Cooking Class**: a cooking class offering visitors the chance to learn about and prepare traditional Nigerien dishes, located in Niamey",
