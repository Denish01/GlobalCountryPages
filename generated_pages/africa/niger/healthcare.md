[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Niger's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The country has a **National Health Policy** that aims to improve healthcare access and quality, but the system faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. In urban areas, such as the capital city Niamey, access to healthcare is generally better, with a greater number of hospitals and healthcare facilities available. However, in rural areas, access to healthcare is limited, and many people rely on traditional medicine or travel long distances to access modern healthcare facilities.

The quality of care in Niger varies, with some hospitals and healthcare facilities providing good quality care, while others may have limited resources and equipment. The **public sector** provides the majority of healthcare services, but the **private sector** is also growing, with many private clinics and hospitals offering specialized services. Despite these efforts, Niger's healthcare system faces significant challenges, including a high **infant mortality rate** and a low **life expectancy**.

The government of Niger has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of **universal health coverage** and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas. However, more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system, including the shortage of medical professionals and the limited access to quality care.
