[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Niger's education system is largely based on the French model, with **French** being the primary language of instruction. The system is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education, with six years of compulsory education. Public schools are generally free or low-cost, but the quality of education can be variable, with limited resources and infrastructure. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available, catering to expatriate families and offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**.

The education system in Niger faces significant challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to education, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve the quality of education. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in education outcomes between urban and rural areas, as well as between boys and girls.
