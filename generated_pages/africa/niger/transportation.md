[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Niger has several international airports, with the main one being Diori Hamani International Airport (NIM) in the capital city of Niamey. This airport receives flights from major airlines such as Air France, Turkish Airlines, and Royal Air Maroc, with direct connections to European and African cities like Paris, Istanbul, and Casablanca. You can also enter Niger by land through its borders with neighboring countries, including Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, and Mali. The most commonly used overland entry points are the border crossings with Nigeria and Burkina Faso, which are served by buses and taxis.

The main border crossings are located in the towns of Maradi, Zinder, and Agadez, which are connected to Niamey by paved roads. However, traveling by land can be challenging due to the poor road conditions and security concerns in some areas. It is recommended to check the current travel advisories and plan your route carefully before embarking on a journey. Additionally, you should ensure that you have all the necessary documents, including a valid passport, visa, and carnet de passage if you are traveling with a vehicle.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Niger has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airline is Niger Airlines, which offers flights from Niamey to several smaller towns, including Agadez, Arlit, and Zinder. You can book domestic flights through the airline's website or at the airport, and prices start from around $100 for a one-way ticket. It is recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as the availability of flights can be limited. Additionally, you should be prepared for possible flight delays or cancellations due to weather conditions or other factors.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Niger does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option within the country. However, there are plans to develop a railway system in the future, which could potentially connect Niger to its neighboring countries and improve transportation links within the region. For now, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are several bus companies operating in Niger, including **SNTV** (Société Nationale des Transports du Niger) and **STAN** (Société de Transport Agadez-Niamey), which offer intercity services to major towns like Agadez, Zinder, and Maradi. The buses are generally in good condition, but the roads can be rough, and journeys can be long and tiring. Prices start from around $10 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and the type of bus. You can book tickets at the bus station or through a local travel agency, and it is recommended to arrive early to secure a seat.
