  "content": "Niger is generally cheaper than Nigeria, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20% in favor of Niger.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nNiger GDP per Capita (PPP): $1,200\nNigeria GDP per Capita (PPP): $2,049\nNiger Inflation Rate: 2.1%\nNigeria Inflation Rate: 15.7%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Niger\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Niger vs Nigeria [/SECTION]\nNiger and Nigeria are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a largely agrarian economy and a high reliance on foreign aid. Nigeria, on the other hand, is the largest economy in Africa, driven by its significant oil reserves and a growing services sector. Despite these differences, both countries share similar cost structures, with high prices for imported goods and services. However, Niger tends to be cheaper than Nigeria, particularly in terms of housing, food, and transportation.\n\nThe cost of living in Niger is generally lower than in Nigeria, with an overall difference of around 15-20%. This is due to several factors, including lower housing costs, cheaper food prices, and lower transportation expenses. Additionally, Niger's economy is more informal, with a larger share of the population engaged in subsistence farming and small-scale trade, which tends to keep prices lower. In contrast, Nigeria's economy is more formalized, with a larger services sector and higher prices for goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Niger (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $100 | $180 | 44% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $300 | $500 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Niger (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $50 | $80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Niger (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Niger (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $30 | $50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Niger (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $400 | $600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | $800 | $1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | $1,200 | $1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Niger is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in Nigeria\n- Food and dining, with meal prices up to 50% lower than in Nigeria\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices up to 50% lower than in Nigeria\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 40% lower than in Nigeria\n- **Nigeria is cheaper for:**\n- Some imported goods, such as electronics and clothing, which may be up to 20% cheaper than in Niger\n- International flights, with more frequent and affordable connections to Europe and other parts of Africa\n- Healthcare, with better-equipped hospitals and more qualified medical professionals\n- Education, with a larger number of international schools and universities\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Niger offers better value for money, particularly in terms of housing, food, and transportation.
