In urban areas like Niamey, the capital city, utilities like electricity, water, and gas are generally more reliable, but in rural areas, access to these services can be limited. The costs of utilities in Niger can fluctuate due to factors like inflation, which was 9.1% in 2024, and seasonal variation. For example, during the dry season, water scarcity can lead to higher costs, while during the rainy season, electricity outages can occur due to flooding.\n\nThe government of Niger has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including investing in renewable energy sources like solar power. However, the cost of utilities can still be a significant burden for many households, especially those with lower incomes. The GDP per capita PPP in Niger was $2,050 in 2024, which is one of the lowest in the world. As a result, many households have to rely on traditional energy sources like charcoal and firewood, which can be hazardous to health and the environment.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $20 | $30 | $40 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in municipal taxes |\n| **Total** | **$40** | **$65** | **$90** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Orange Niger, Moov Niger |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Orange Niger, Moov Niger |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Orange Niger, Moov Niger, Airtel Niger |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Orange Niger, Moov Niger, Airtel Niger |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Orange Niger, Moov Niger |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | available in Niger |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Niger |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | not widely available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Niger, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as NIGELEC for electricity and SEEN for water.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget their energy usage.\n- The best internet providers in Niger are Orange Niger and Moov Niger, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, households can use energy-efficient appliances and turn off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with providers for better rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
