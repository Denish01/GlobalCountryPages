This system aims to balance the powers between the two, with the President holding significant influence over foreign and defense policies, and the Prime Minister responsible for domestic and economic affairs. The separation of powers is further reinforced by an independent **judiciary** that oversees the application of the law. Niger's political system is also characterized by a unicameral legislature, known as the **National Assembly**, which is composed of 171 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term.\n\nThe government of Niger has faced numerous challenges in maintaining stability and security, particularly in the face of terrorist threats from neighboring countries. Despite these challenges, the country has made significant progress in consolidating its democratic institutions and promoting economic development. The **Constitution** of Niger, adopted in 2010, provides the framework for the country's governance and outlines the principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\n\nNiger's political system has been marked by periods of instability and military intervention, but the country has made significant progress in recent years in consolidating its democratic institutions and promoting economic development. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving governance, reducing corruption, and promoting transparency. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including poverty, inequality, and insecurity, which continue to pose significant threats to its stability and development.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Mohamed Bazoum | Head of State |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou | Head of Government |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | President of the National Assembly, Seini Oumarou | Lawmaking body |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court, Amadou Kantaté | Highest court of appeal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD) | Center-right | Seini Oumarou | 20 | One of the largest parties in Niger |\n| Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS) | Center-left | Mohamed Bazoum | 79 | Current ruling party |\n| Nigerien Democratic Movement for an African Federation (MODEN/FA) | Center | Hama Amadou | 19 | Former ruling party |\n| Social Democratic Party (PSD) | Center-left | Cheiffou Amadou | 12 | Opposition party |\n| Patriotic Movement for the Republic (MPR) | Center-right | Albadé Abba Issa | 7 | Opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Niger is based on a proportional representation system, where voters elect members to the National Assembly for a five-year term.\n- Presidential elections are held every five years, with the most recent election taking place in 2021.\n- The last legislative election was held in 2021, with the PNDS emerging as the largest party.\n- Voter participation in Niger's elections has been relatively low, with an average turnout of around 50% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Niger faces significant security challenges, particularly from terrorist groups operating in the Sahel region.\n- The country is also vulnerable to climate change, with frequent droughts and floods affecting agricultural production and food security.\n- Corruption remains a major challenge, with Niger ranking 136 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index.\n- The government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving governance and reducing corruption, but more needs to be done to address these challenges.\n- Regional dynamics, particularly the conflict in neighboring Mali and Libya, also pose significant challenges to Niger's stability and security.\n- Freedom indices, such as the Press Freedom Index and the Human Freedom Index, indicate that Niger still has significant work to do in promoting individual freedoms and human rights.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Niger is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n- The country has close relations with its neighbors, particularly France, which provides significant military and economic support.\n- Niger is also a key partner in the Sahel region's security efforts, working closely with other countries to combat terrorism and promote stability.\n- The country has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries, including the United States, China, and the European Union.\n- Niger is also a member of the International Organization of the Francophonie, which promotes cooperation among French-speaking countries.",
