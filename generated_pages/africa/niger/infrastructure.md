# Niger Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Niger's infrastructure is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in roads, power, and water supply, particularly in rural areas, despite recent investments and development projects aimed at improving the country's infrastructure.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 19% of population
Internet Penetration: 4%
Road Network: 18,949 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 2
Major Ports: landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Niger's infrastructure is one of the least developed in the world, with significant challenges in providing basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation to its population. The country has made efforts to improve its infrastructure in recent years, with investments in roads, energy, and telecommunications. However, the urban-rural gap remains significant, with most modern infrastructure concentrated in the capital city, Niamey, and other major urban centers. The government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including the development of a national infrastructure plan and the creation of a public-private partnership framework to attract private sector investment.

The lack of infrastructure in Niger is a major obstacle to the country's economic development, with significant impacts on trade, commerce, and industry. The transportation network, for example, is limited and often in poor condition, making it difficult to move goods and people around the country. The energy sector is also underdeveloped, with most of the population relying on traditional biomass for cooking and lighting. Despite these challenges, Niger has significant potential for growth and development, with a young and rapidly growing population and a strategic location in the heart of West Africa.

Niger's infrastructure development is also hindered by its landlocked location, which makes it reliant on neighboring countries for access to ports and international trade. The country has to transport its goods through the ports of neighboring countries, such as Nigeria and Benin, which increases the cost and complexity of trade. However, the government is working to develop its transportation network and improve its connectivity with regional and international markets.

| Ports | landlocked | - | Niger relies on neighboring countries for access to ports and international trade |
[/TABLE]

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- Niger's energy sector is dominated by traditional biomass, with most of the population relying on wood and charcoal for cooking and lighting.
- The country has significant potential for renewable energy development, particularly solar and wind power, with several projects currently under development.
- The power grid is limited and unreliable, with frequent outages and power shortages, particularly in rural areas.
- The government has launched several initiatives to improve energy access, including the development of off-grid solar systems and mini-grids.
- Niger is also exploring opportunities for regional power trade and integration, including the development of a regional power pool with neighboring countries.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- Access to safe drinking water is a significant challenge in Niger, with only about 50% of the population having access to improved water sources.
- Sanitation coverage is also limited, with about 10% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.
- The government has launched several initiatives to improve water and sanitation services, including the development of new water supply systems and sanitation infrastructure.
- Water access is particularly challenging in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional wells and water sources.
- The country is also vulnerable to climate change, with droughts and floods having significant impacts on water resources and sanitation infrastructure.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- Mobile phone coverage is relatively widespread in Niger, with about 40% of the population having access to mobile phones.
- Internet penetration is limited, with only about 4% of the population having access to the internet.
- The government has launched several initiatives to improve telecommunications services, including the development of new fiber optic cables and mobile phone networks.
- Niger is also exploring opportunities for regional telecommunications integration, including the development of a regional fiber optic cable network.
- The postal service is also available, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services across the country.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The government has launched several major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of new roads and highways.
- The development of a new international airport in Niamey is also underway, with funding from the African Development Bank and other international partners.
- Niger is also exploring opportunities for private sector investment in infrastructure, including the development of public-private partnerships for energy, water, and transportation projects.
- The country is also participating in several regional infrastructure development initiatives, including the development of a regional transportation network and a regional energy market.
- The government has also launched several initiatives to improve energy access, including the development of off-grid solar systems and mini-grids, with funding from international partners such as the World Bank and the European Union.
