[SECTION] Overview: Niger vs Nigeria [/SECTION]
Niger and Nigeria are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a largely agrarian economy and a high reliance on foreign aid. Nigeria, on the other hand, is the largest economy in Africa, driven by its significant oil reserves and a growing services sector. Despite these differences, both countries share similar cost structures, with high prices for imported goods and services. However, Niger tends to be cheaper than Nigeria, particularly in terms of housing, food, and transportation.

The cost of living in Niger is generally lower than in Nigeria, with an overall difference of around 15-20%. This is due to several factors, including lower housing costs, cheaper food prices, and lower transportation expenses. Additionally, Niger's economy is more informal, with a larger share of the population engaged in subsistence farming and small-scale trade, which tends to keep prices lower. In contrast, Nigeria's economy is more formalized, with a larger services sector and higher prices for goods and services.
