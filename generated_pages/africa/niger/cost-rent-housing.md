[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Niger's housing market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern dwellings, with a significant portion of the population living in informal settlements. The rental market is relatively underdeveloped, with most properties being owned by individuals or families who rent them out to tenants. Typical lease terms in Niger are relatively short, ranging from 6-12 months, and often require a deposit equivalent to 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through traditional mediation rather than formal legal channels. Compared to its regional neighbors, Niger's housing costs are relatively affordable, with prices lower than in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana, but higher than in some of its landlocked neighbors like Mali and Burkina Faso.

The housing market in Niger is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 9.1% and a GDP per capita of $2,050 affecting the purchasing power of the population. Additionally, the country's limited access to healthcare and education, with out-of-pocket health expenditure accounting for 51.5% of total health expenditure and education spending accounting for only 4.1% of GDP, can impact the overall affordability of housing. As a result, many Nigeriens rely on informal housing arrangements, such as shared accommodations or traditional dwellings, which can be more affordable but often lack basic amenities.
