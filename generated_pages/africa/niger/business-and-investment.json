The government has implemented various reforms to attract foreign investment, including the creation of a one-stop shop for investors and the simplification of business registration procedures. However, the country still faces significant bureaucratic hurdles, and corruption remains a major obstacle to doing business.

This can make it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.

The government has taken steps to address these issues, including the establishment of an anti-corruption agency and the implementation of measures to increase transparency and accountability.\n\nNiger's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, with the sector accounting for around 40% of GDP.
