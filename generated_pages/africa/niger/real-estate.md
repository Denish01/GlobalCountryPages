[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Niger is primarily driven by the demand for residential and commercial spaces in the capital city, Niamey. The market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern buildings, with a growing trend towards the development of new residential areas and commercial centers. The prices of properties in Niger have been steadily increasing over the years, driven by the growing demand and limited supply. However, the market is still relatively underdeveloped, and the prices are relatively low compared to other countries in the region.

The urban areas, particularly Niamey, have seen significant growth and development in recent years, with the construction of new buildings, roads, and infrastructure. The rural areas, on the other hand, are still largely underdeveloped, with limited access to basic amenities and services. The property market in Niger is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including the mining and agricultural sectors, which are the main drivers of the economy.

The current market conditions in Niger are characterized by a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in the urban areas. The government has launched several initiatives to address this issue, including the construction of new housing units and the provision of subsidies to low-income households. However, the demand for housing still outstrips the supply, and the prices of properties are likely to continue to rise in the coming years.
