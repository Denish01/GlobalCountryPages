# Niger Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Niger before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Niger has a moderate visa policy, requiring visitors from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. However, a few nationalities are eligible for visa-free access or can obtain a visa on arrival. Citizens of countries such as Algeria, Libya, Mali, and Nigeria are exempt from visa requirements, while others may need to apply for a visa at the nearest embassy or consulate of Niger. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control the flow of visitors with the desire to promote tourism and economic development.

The government of Niger has introduced an e-visa system to facilitate the visa application process for eligible nationalities. The e-visa is available for tourists, business travelers, and other visitors who meet specific requirements. The country's visa policy is subject to change, and it is essential to check with the official embassy or consulate of Niger for the most up-to-date information.
