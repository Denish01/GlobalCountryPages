  "content": "The cost of education in Niger varies widely, with public schools being generally free or low-cost, while private schools and international institutions can be quite expensive, with annual fees ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 4.1%\nLiteracy Rate: 19.7%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nNiger's education system is largely based on the French model, with **French** being the primary language of instruction. The system is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education, with six years of compulsory education. Public schools are generally free or low-cost, but the quality of education can be variable, with limited resources and infrastructure. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available, catering to expatriate families and offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**.\n\nThe education system in Niger faces significant challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to education, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve the quality of education. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in education outcomes between urban and rural areas, as well as between boys and girls.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$20 | Free or subsidized, variable quality |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Range by tier, better quality than public |\n| Public Secondary | $20-$50 | Free or subsidized, variable quality |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,000 | Range by tier, better quality than public |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Range by curriculum, high-quality education |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$300 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs, variable quality |\n| Private University | $500-$1,500 | $1,000-$3,000 | Range by institution, better quality than public |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$2,500 | $2,000-$5,000 | Limited options, high-quality education |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$50 | Limited availability, variable quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Range by subject and tutor |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | Range by language and institution |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic supplies, variable cost |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **best schools for expats** are generally international schools, which offer a high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- **Scholarship availability** is limited, but some institutions offer scholarships to talented students.\n- **Online learning options** are becoming increasingly available, particularly for higher education.\n- Education quality in Niger is generally lower than in other countries in the region, due to limited resources and infrastructure.\n- **French language skills** are highly valued in Niger, and proficiency in French can significantly improve job prospects.\n- For students seeking higher education, **university rankings** can be a useful guide, with institutions such as the **University of Niamey** being among the top-ranked in the country.",
