Niger's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with a strong focus on subsistence farming and livestock production. The country's economic classification is low-income, with a GDP per capita of approximately $300. Niger's development level is relatively low, with significant challenges in areas such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare. The country's economic trajectory has been influenced by its landlocked location, limited natural resources, and vulnerability to climate change. Despite these challenges, Niger has made efforts to diversify its economy and attract foreign investment, particularly in the mining and manufacturing sectors.

Niger's economy is also heavily reliant on foreign aid, with significant contributions from international organizations and donor countries. The country has made progress in recent years in improving its economic governance and business environment, but significant challenges remain. The ease of doing business in Niger is ranked 143 out of 190 countries, indicating a need for further reforms to simplify regulatory procedures and improve the business climate.

To address these challenges, the government has implemented policies aimed at promoting economic diversification, improving infrastructure, and enhancing the business environment.
