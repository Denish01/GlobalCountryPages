        <h2>How Niger Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Niger is a sovereign country located in West Africa, and its administrative structure is divided into 8 regions. These regions are further divided into 36 departments, which are then subdivided into communes. The 8 regions of Niger are Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi, and Zinder. Each region has its own regional assembly and governor, who are responsible for overseeing the administration of their respective regions. The capital city, Niamey, is located in the Niamey region and serves as the country's economic, cultural, and administrative center.</p>
        <p>The administrative divisions of Niger were established in 1992, with the aim of decentralizing power and promoting regional development.

The regional assemblies and governors play a crucial role in implementing these initiatives and addressing the specific needs of their regions.</p>

The main mode of transportation is by road, with buses and taxis connecting major cities and towns.

Additionally, there are several domestic airports, with flights connecting Niamey to other major cities. However, flights can be irregular and may be subject to cancellation due to weather or other factors.</p>
