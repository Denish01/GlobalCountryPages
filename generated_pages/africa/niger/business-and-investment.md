[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Niger's business environment is characterized by a mix of opportunities and challenges. The government has implemented various reforms to attract foreign investment, including the creation of a one-stop shop for investors and the simplification of business registration procedures. However, the country still faces significant bureaucratic hurdles, and corruption remains a major obstacle to doing business. The government's attitude towards foreign investment is generally positive, with a focus on promoting economic growth and development. Despite this, the business climate is often hampered by a lack of infrastructure, including limited access to electricity, water, and transportation networks.

The level of bureaucracy in Niger is relatively high, with many procedures requiring multiple approvals and licenses. This can make it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Corruption is also a significant issue, with many businesses reporting that they have to pay bribes to obtain necessary permits and licenses. The government has taken steps to address these issues, including the establishment of an anti-corruption agency and the implementation of measures to increase transparency and accountability.

Niger's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, with the sector accounting for around 40% of GDP. The country is also rich in natural resources, including uranium, gold, and oil. The government has implemented policies to promote the development of these sectors, including the creation of a mining code and the establishment of a national oil company.
