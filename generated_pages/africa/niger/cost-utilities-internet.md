[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Niger's utility infrastructure is still developing, and the quality of services can vary significantly depending on the location. In urban areas like Niamey, the capital city, utilities like electricity, water, and gas are generally more reliable, but in rural areas, access to these services can be limited. The costs of utilities in Niger can fluctuate due to factors like inflation, which was 9.1% in 2024, and seasonal variation. For example, during the dry season, water scarcity can lead to higher costs, while during the rainy season, electricity outages can occur due to flooding.

The government of Niger has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including investing in renewable energy sources like solar power. However, the cost of utilities can still be a significant burden for many households, especially those with lower incomes. The GDP per capita PPP in Niger was $2,050 in 2024, which is one of the lowest in the world. As a result, many households have to rely on traditional energy sources like charcoal and firewood, which can be hazardous to health and the environment.
