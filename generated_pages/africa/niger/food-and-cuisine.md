[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Niger's cuisine is characterized by the use of locally-sourced ingredients, such as **millet**, **sorghum**, and **peanuts**, which are staples in the country. The cuisine is also influenced by the country's **French** colonial past, as well as **Arabic** and **Haussa** traditions. In rural areas, meals are often simple and based on traditional ingredients, while in urban centers, such as **Niamey**, a wider variety of dishes and international cuisine can be found. Regional variations exist, with the **Air Mountains** region known for its unique **Tuareg** cuisine, which features dishes such as **taguella**, a type of flatbread.

The country's cuisine is also shaped by its **Islamic** heritage, with many dishes being **halal**, or permissible under Islamic law. This means that pork and other non-halal meats are rarely consumed, and **vegetarian** options are widely available. In addition, the country's cuisine has been influenced by its **West African** neighbors, such as **Mali** and **Nigeria**, with dishes such as **jollof rice** and **fufu** being popular.

Niger's food culture is also closely tied to its social and cultural traditions, with meals often being seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds. In rural areas, meals are often eaten from a communal bowl, using the **right hand** only, as the **left hand** is considered unclean. This emphasis on community and hospitality is a key aspect of Niger's food culture, and visitors are often warmly welcomed and invited to share meals with locals.
