[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with varying levels of quality. Public schools are generally less expensive but often struggle with limited resources and large class sizes, while private schools offer better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily English, with some schools also teaching in local languages. Compulsory education in Uganda lasts for 7 years, from primary 1 to primary 7, and is free for all citizens. However, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the school and location. International schools are also available in Uganda, mainly in urban areas, offering a range of curricula such as the British, American, and International Baccalaureate.

The education system in Uganda faces several challenges, including limited access to education in rural areas, high dropout rates, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education sector, including increasing funding and implementing initiatives to improve teacher training and school infrastructure. Expatriates and international students can find a range of educational options in Uganda, from public and private schools to international schools and universities. The quality of education in Uganda is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, but there are some excellent schools and universities that offer high-quality education.
