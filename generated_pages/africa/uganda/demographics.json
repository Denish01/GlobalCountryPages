  "content": "Uganda is home to a diverse population of approximately 48.6 million people, with a mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that shape the country's cultural identity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 48.6 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 3.3%\nMedian Age: 16.7 years\nUrban Population: 23.8%\nPopulation Density: 201 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 63.4 years\nFertility Rate: 5.1 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nUganda's population size is significant in the context of East Africa, with the country accounting for about 10% of the region's total population. The population growth rate is relatively high, driven by a combination of factors including a high total fertility rate and declining mortality rates. Urbanization is also on the rise, with many Ugandans moving to cities such as Kampala in search of better economic opportunities. However, this trend also poses challenges, including strain on urban infrastructure and services. Migration patterns in Uganda are complex, with many people moving within the country or to neighboring countries in search of work, education, or refuge.\n\nThe population of Uganda is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that the country will reach a population of over 60 million by 2030. This growth will have significant implications for the country's development, including increased demand for services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. To address these challenges, the government of Uganda has implemented policies aimed at reducing population growth rates and improving access to family planning services.\n\nUganda's population is also characterized by a high proportion of young people, with over 70% of the population under the age of 30. This demographic profile presents both opportunities and challenges, as a large and growing youth population can be a driving force for economic development, but also requires significant investment in education, healthcare, and job creation.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baganda | 16.9% | Central | Largest ethnic group in Uganda |\n| Banyankole | 9.5% | Western | Predominantly found in the Ankole region |\n| Basoga | 8.4% | Eastern | Mainly found in the Busoga region |\n| Bakiga | 6.9% | Western | Primarily found in the Kigezi region |\n| Iteso | 6.4% | Eastern | Mainly found in the Teso region |\n| Langi | 5.9% | Northern | Predominantly found in the Lango region |\n| Acholi | 4.7% | Northern | Mainly found in the Acholi region |\n[/TABLE]\nUganda is home to over 40 ethnic groups, each with their own distinct culture and language. The country's ethnic diversity is a source of strength and richness, but also poses challenges, particularly in terms of promoting national unity and addressing historical grievances. Despite these challenges, Uganda has made significant progress in promoting ethnic harmony and cooperation, with many ethnic groups living together peacefully and contributing to the country's cultural and economic development.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **English** is the official language of Uganda and is widely used in government, education, and business.\n- **Swahili** is also widely spoken, particularly in the north and east of the country, and is used as a lingua franca.\n- **Luganda** is the most widely spoken local language, with over 5 million speakers, primarily in the central region.\n- **Lusoga** is another widely spoken local language, with over 2 million speakers, mainly in the eastern region.\n- **Runyankole** is a prominent language in the western region, with over 1 million speakers.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Christianity | 85.2% | Mainly Catholic, Anglican, and Pentecostal |\n| Islam | 13.7% | Mainly Sunni |\n| Traditional | 0.5% | Indigenous beliefs and practices |\n| Other | 0.6% | Including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Baha'i |\n[/TABLE]\nUganda is a religiously diverse country, with a majority of the population identifying as Christian. The country has a long history of religious tolerance and cooperation, with many different faiths coexisting peacefully. The government of Uganda has also taken steps to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding, including the establishment of the Inter-Religious Council of Uganda.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 48.3% | High dependency ratio, strain on education and healthcare services |\n| 15-24 | 21.4% | Significant youth population, opportunities for economic development |\n| 25-54 | 26.2% | Working-age population, key contributors to the economy |\n| 55-64 | 3.4% | Aging population, increasing demand for healthcare and social services |\n| 65+ | 0.7% | Elderly population, opportunities for intergenerational knowledge transfer |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- Uganda has a relatively low urbanization rate, with around 23.8% of the population living in urban areas.\n- **Kampala** is the largest city, with a population of over 1.6 million people, and serves as the country's economic and cultural hub.\n- **Wakiso** and **Mbarara** are other major urban centers, with populations of over 200,000 people.\n- The fastest-growing cities in Uganda are primarily located in the central and western regions, driven by economic opportunities and infrastructure development.\n- Uganda also has a significant diaspora community, with many Ugandans living and working abroad, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries.",
