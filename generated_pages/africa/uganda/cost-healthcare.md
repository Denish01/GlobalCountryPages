[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda's healthcare system is mixed, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and long waiting times. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are better equipped and staffed, but often expensive and out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, private healthcare facilities are generally the preferred option, as they offer better quality care and more English-speaking staff. However, it is recommended that foreigners and locals alike have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.

The healthcare system in Uganda is designed to provide basic healthcare services to all citizens, with a focus on preventative care and public health programs. However, the system is often overwhelmed, and many people rely on traditional healers or self-medication. For those who can afford it, private healthcare facilities offer a range of services, from routine check-ups to complex surgeries. Many private facilities also offer health insurance packages, which can help cover the cost of medical care.
