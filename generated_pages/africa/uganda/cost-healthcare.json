  "content": "In Uganda, healthcare costs vary significantly between public and private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $45, and out-of-pocket spend being around 32.2% of total health expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $45\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 32.2%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911 or 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: UGX\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nUganda's healthcare system is mixed, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and long waiting times. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are better equipped and staffed, but often expensive and out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, private healthcare facilities are generally the preferred option, as they offer better quality care and more English-speaking staff. However, it is recommended that foreigners and locals alike have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Uganda is designed to provide basic healthcare services to all citizens, with a focus on preventative care and public health programs. However, the system is often overwhelmed, and many people rely on traditional healers or self-medication. For those who can afford it, private healthcare facilities offer a range of services, from routine check-ups to complex surgeries. Many private facilities also offer health insurance packages, which can help cover the cost of medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | Prices vary by city and dentist |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-30 | Prices vary by city and optometrist |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $20-50 | Prices vary by lab and test |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-100 | Prices vary by hospital and room type |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-500 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-200 | Prices vary by hospital and doctor |\n| MRI Scan | $100-300 | Prices vary by lab and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-50 | Prices vary by lab and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-20 | Covers basic medical care, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Covers comprehensive medical care, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-300 | Covers comprehensive medical care, including evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **painkillers** are widely available and relatively affordable, with prices starting from $5-10.\n- **Prescription rules** vary by medication and pharmacy, but many medications can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good, with many pharmacies located in urban areas.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available, but it is recommended to consult a doctor before taking any medication.\n- **Vaccinations** are available at many pharmacies and healthcare facilities, with prices starting from $10-20.\n- **Medication prices** vary by pharmacy and location, but many pharmacies offer discounts for bulk purchases.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or 112 for assistance. **Ambulance services** are available in many urban areas, but may not be readily available in rural areas.
