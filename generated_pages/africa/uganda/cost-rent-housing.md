[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda's rental market is largely driven by demand from the expat community, students, and young professionals, with the majority of rentals being apartments and houses in the city center and suburbs. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are relatively well-protected, with the Ugandan government implementing laws to regulate the rental market and prevent exploitation. Compared to regional neighbors, Uganda's housing costs are relatively affordable, with prices lower than in Kenya and Tanzania but higher than in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The housing market in Uganda is also influenced by the country's growing economy and urbanization, with many Ugandans moving to cities in search of better job opportunities and living standards. This has led to an increase in demand for housing, particularly in the city center and suburbs, where prices are higher due to the proximity to amenities and services. However, the rental market remains relatively informal, with many landlords and tenants negotiating contracts on a case-by-case basis.
