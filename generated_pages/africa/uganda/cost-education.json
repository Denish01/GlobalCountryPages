Public schools are generally less expensive but often struggle with limited resources and large class sizes, while private schools offer better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily English, with some schools also teaching in local languages. Compulsory education in Uganda lasts for 7 years, from primary 1 to primary 7, and is free for all citizens. However, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the school and location. International schools are also available in Uganda, mainly in urban areas, offering a range of curricula such as the British, American, and International Baccalaureate.\n\nThe education system in Uganda faces several challenges, including limited access to education in rural areas, high dropout rates, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the education sector, including increasing funding and implementing initiatives to improve teacher training and school infrastructure. Expatriates and international students can find a range of educational options in Uganda, from public and private schools to international schools and universities. The quality of education in Uganda is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, but there are some excellent schools and universities that offer high-quality education.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$20 | Free, but may require payment for uniforms, supplies, and exams |\n| Private Primary | $100-$500 | Range depends on school tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $20-$50 | Subsidized, but may require payment for uniforms, supplies, and exams |\n| Private Secondary | $200-$1,000 | Range depends on school tier and location |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Offers British, American, or International Baccalaureate curriculum |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Fees vary depending on program and university |\n| Private University | $500-$2,000 | $1,000-$3,000 | Fees vary depending on program and university |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Makerere University is a top-ranked public university in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$100 | Depends on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$30 | Depends on subject and tutor qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$200 | Depends on language and course provider |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Depends on school and grade level |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Depends on school and uniform quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Uganda are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and high-quality facilities.\n- Scholarships are available for Ugandan students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, but options are limited for international students.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular in Uganda, with some universities and schools offering online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in Uganda is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, but there are some excellent schools and universities that offer high-quality education.\n- Expatriates and international students should research schools and universities thoroughly before making a decision, considering factors such as curriculum, facilities, and teacher qualifications.\n- The **Uganda National Examinations Board** is responsible for overseeing national exams and education standards in Uganda, providing a framework for education quality and assessment.",
