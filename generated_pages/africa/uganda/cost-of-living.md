[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]
- Consider staying in budget-friendly accommodations, such as hostels or guesthouses, to save on housing costs.
- Eat local food, such as **matooke** and **chapati**, which are often cheaper and more flavorful than Western-style meals.
- Use public transportation, such as **boda-bodas** and **matatus**, to get around, which can be much cheaper than taxis.
- Avoid traveling during peak season, which typically runs from June to September, to save on accommodation and tour prices.
- Learn some basic **Luganda** phrases, such as "webale" (thank you) and "sawa" (okay), to show respect for the local culture and potentially negotiate better prices.
- Bring a **water filter** or **purification tablets** to avoid buying bottled water, which can be expensive and contribute to plastic waste.
