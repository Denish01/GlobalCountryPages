[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which occurs from December to February and June to August, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 18 to 28 degrees Celsius. This season is ideal for safaris and outdoor activities, as the dry conditions make it easier to spot wildlife and navigate through national parks. The wet season, which occurs from March to May and September to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and potential flooding, making it more challenging to travel and engage in outdoor activities.

The climate in Uganda varies across different regions, with the northern and eastern parts of the country experiencing a semi-arid climate, while the western and central regions have a more temperate climate. The **Lake Victoria** region, which includes the capital city Kampala, has a mild climate, with average temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 degrees Celsius throughout the year. The **Mount Elgon** and **Rwenzori Mountains** regions have a cooler climate, with average temperatures ranging from 10 to 18 degrees Celsius, making them ideal for hiking and trekking.

The seasons in Uganda have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, national parks and tourist attractions are more crowded, and prices for accommodations and tour packages are higher. The wet season, on the other hand, is considered the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices. However, some tourists prefer to visit during the wet season, as the landscapes are more lush and green, and the wildlife is more abundant.
