Uganda is situated in eastern Africa, with its borders shared by five countries: South Sudan to the north, Kenya to the east, Tanzania to the south, Rwanda to the southwest, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. The country is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, but it is home to several large lakes, including Lake Victoria, Lake Albert, and Lake Edward, which are all part of the Nile River basin. The country's strategic location at the heart of Africa makes it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region.

Uganda's borders are largely defined by its natural geography, with the Nile River forming the border with South Sudan to the north and the Kagera River forming the border with Tanzania to the south. The country's western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo is marked by the Ruwenzori Mountains, while the eastern border with Kenya is defined by the Suam River. The border with Rwanda to the southwest is relatively short and is marked by the Kagera River.
