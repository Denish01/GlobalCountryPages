The country is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, but it is home to several large lakes, including Lake Victoria, Lake Albert, and Lake Edward, which are all part of the Nile River basin. The country's strategic location at the heart of Africa makes it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region.\n\nUganda's borders are largely defined by its natural geography, with the Nile River forming the border with South Sudan to the north and the Kagera River forming the border with Tanzania to the south. The country's western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo is marked by the Ruwenzori Mountains, while the eastern border with Kenya is defined by the Suam River. The border with Rwanda to the southwest is relatively short and is marked by the Kagera River.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nUganda's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, valleys, and plains. The country's most notable mountain range is the Ruwenzori Mountains, which form the western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and include the highest peak, Margherita Peak, which rises to an elevation of 5,109 meters. The Ruwenzori Mountains are often referred to as the \"Mountains of the Moon\" due to their rugged and snow-capped peaks. The country's other notable mountain range is the Virunga Mountains, which form the southwestern border with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nIn addition to its mountain ranges, Uganda is home to several large lakes, including Lake Victoria, which is the largest lake in Africa and the second-largest freshwater lake in the world. The lake is an important source of fish and other aquatic resources, and its shores are home to several major cities, including Entebbe and Jinja.
