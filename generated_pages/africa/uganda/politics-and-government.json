  "content": "Uganda is governed as a presidential republic with a multi-party system, where the President serves as both the head of state and head of government.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President Yoweri Museveni\nHead of Government: President Yoweri Museveni\nLegislature: National Assembly, unicameral with 529 seats\nLegal System: Mixed law, with common law, customary law, and Islamic law\nPolitical Stability Index: Uganda ranks 124 out of 163 countries in the Global Peace Index, indicating a medium level of stability\nCorruption Index: Uganda ranks 142 out of 180 countries in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating a high level of corruption\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Uganda is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President has significant powers, including the ability to appoint and dismiss ministers, as well as to dissolve the National Assembly. The legislative branch, known as the National Assembly, is composed of 529 members, with 353 elected by universal adult suffrage and 146 appointed by special interest groups. The National Assembly has the power to make laws, approve the budget, and exercise oversight over the executive branch. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court, and is responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly.\n\nThe system of government in Uganda is unitary, with a strong central government and limited powers granted to local governments. The country is divided into 134 districts, each with its own local government, but these districts have limited autonomy and are subject to the authority of the central government. The separation of powers between the branches of government is intended to provide checks and balances, but in practice, the executive branch has often dominated the other two branches.\n\nThe **presidential system** in Uganda has been criticized for concentrating too much power in the hands of the President, and for limiting the ability of the legislative and judicial branches to hold the executive branch accountable. However, the system has also been credited with providing stability and continuity, particularly during times of crisis.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President Yoweri Museveni | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Cabinet | Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja | Advisory body to the President |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker Anita Among | Makes laws and exercises oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice Alfonse Owiny-Dollo | Interprets the law and ensures its fair application |\n| Judicial | Court of Appeal | Deputy Chief Justice Richard Buteera | Hears appeals from lower courts |\n| Judicial | High Court | Principal Judge Dr. Flavian Zeija | Hears cases and makes judgments |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Resistance Movement (NRM) | Center-right | President Yoweri Museveni | 337 | Dominant party since 1986 |\n| Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) | Center-left | Patrick Amuriat | 36 | Main opposition party |\n| Democratic Party (DP) | Center | Norbert Mao | 9 | One of the oldest parties in Uganda |\n| Uganda People's Congress (UPC) | Center-left | Jimmy Akena | 9 | Former ruling party |\n| Alliance for National Transformation (ANT) | Center | Mugisha Muntu | 0 | New party formed in 2019 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Uganda is based on universal adult suffrage, with all citizens aged 18 and above eligible to vote.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent presidential and parliamentary elections taking place in 2021.\n- The last election was marked by controversy and violence, with the opposition alleging widespread rigging and intimidation.\n- The next election is scheduled to take place in 2026, and is expected to be highly contested.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Uganda is characterized by a mix of stability and tension, with the ruling NRM party maintaining its grip on power but facing challenges from opposition parties and civil society groups.\n- Key issues facing the country include poverty, corruption, and inequality, as well as regional dynamics such as the conflict in neighboring South Sudan.\n- Uganda ranks 43rd out of 54 countries in the **Ibrahim Index of African Governance**, which measures governance, economic development, and human development.\n- The country faces significant challenges in terms of **human rights**, with restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, and association.\n- Uganda has a **Corruption Perceptions Index** score of 27 out of 100, indicating a high level of corruption.\n- The country has a **Press Freedom Index** ranking of 125 out of 180, indicating a medium level of press freedom.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Uganda is a member of the **United Nations**, the **African Union**, and the **East African Community**, and plays an active role in regional and international affairs.\n- The country has close relations with neighboring countries, particularly **Kenya** and **Tanzania**, with which it shares economic and security interests.\n- Uganda has also developed strong ties with **China**, which has become a major investor in the country's infrastructure and economy.\n- The country has a complex relationship with **Western countries**, particularly the **United States** and **United Kingdom**, which have provided significant aid and support but also criticized the government's human rights record.\n- Uganda is a key player in regional security initiatives, including the **African Union Mission in Somalia** and the **United Nations Mission in South Sudan**.",
