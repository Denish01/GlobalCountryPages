[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with many facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive and out of reach for many Ugandans. The quality of care in Uganda is generally considered to be lower than in many other countries, with a **Quality Rating** of 2/5. Access to healthcare is also a significant issue, particularly in rural areas where facilities and personnel may be scarce.

The Ugandan government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas. However, many challenges remain, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of funding. In urban areas, such as Kampala, there are more healthcare options available, including private hospitals and clinics, which can provide a higher level of care.

Despite these challenges, Uganda has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes in recent years, particularly in areas such as **maternal and child health**. The country has also made efforts to increase access to healthcare services, including the introduction of community-based health insurance schemes. However, more work needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality that exist between urban and rural areas.
