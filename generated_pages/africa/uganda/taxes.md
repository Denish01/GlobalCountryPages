[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda operates a **territorial taxation** system, where tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the taxpayer's residence. However, **worldwide taxation** applies to residents, who are taxed on their global income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. Residency rules for tax purposes are based on physical presence, with individuals considered resident if they spend more than 183 days in Uganda within a 12-month period. The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) is responsible for administering the tax system and ensuring compliance with tax laws.

The tax system in Uganda is designed to promote economic growth and stability, with a range of incentives and exemptions available to encourage investment and entrepreneurship. The URA has implemented various measures to simplify the tax compliance process, including online filing and payment systems. Despite these efforts, the tax system remains complex, and taxpayers are advised to seek professional advice to ensure they are meeting their tax obligations.
