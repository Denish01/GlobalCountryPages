[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Uganda is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory, lasts for seven years and is free for all citizens. Secondary education, which is also free, lasts for six years and is divided into two levels: ordinary level and advanced level. Tertiary education, which includes universities and other institutions, offers a range of programs in fields such as medicine, engineering, and business. The quality of education in Uganda varies, with public schools generally considered to be of lower quality than private schools. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of free primary and secondary education.

The education system in Uganda faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, Uganda has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and women. The country has also implemented various programs to promote education, including the introduction of vocational training and adult education programs. The private sector has also played a significant role in the development of the education system, with many private schools and universities offering high-quality education.

The government of Uganda has implemented various reforms to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of a new curriculum and the establishment of a national examination board. The government has also increased funding for education, with a significant portion of the national budget allocated to the sector. Despite these efforts, the education system in Uganda still faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate infrastructure.
