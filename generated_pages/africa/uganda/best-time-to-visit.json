Peak season: June to August and December to January. Budget season: April to May and September to November. Avoid: March to May and September to November, due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nUganda has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which occurs from December to February and June to August, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 18 to 28 degrees Celsius. This season is ideal for safaris and outdoor activities, as the dry conditions make it easier to spot wildlife and navigate through national parks. The wet season, which occurs from March to May and September to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and potential flooding, making it more challenging to travel and engage in outdoor activities.\n\nThe climate in Uganda varies across different regions, with the northern and eastern parts of the country experiencing a semi-arid climate, while the western and central regions have a more temperate climate. The **Lake Victoria** region, which includes the capital city Kampala, has a mild climate, with average temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 degrees Celsius throughout the year. The **Mount Elgon** and **Rwenzori Mountains** regions have a cooler climate, with average temperatures ranging from 10 to 18 degrees Celsius, making them ideal for hiking and trekking.\n\nThe seasons in Uganda have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, national parks and tourist attractions are more crowded, and prices for accommodations and tour packages are higher. The wet season, on the other hand, is considered the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices. However, some tourists prefer to visit during the wet season, as the landscapes are more lush and green, and the wildlife is more abundant.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Dry and sunny | Low | $ | Birdwatching, safaris |\n| February | Dry and sunny | Low | $ | Wildlife spotting, hiking |\n| March | Wet and humid | Low | $ | Birdwatching, fishing |\n| April | Wet and humid | Low | $ | Whitewater rafting, kayaking |\n| May | Wet and humid | Low | $ | Fishing, boat cruises |\n| June | Dry and sunny | Medium | $$ | Safaris, wildlife spotting |\n| July | Dry and sunny | High | $$$ | Peak tourist season, game drives |\n| August | Dry and sunny | High | $$$ | Peak tourist season, hiking |\n| September | Wet and humid | Medium | $$ | Birdwatching, fishing |\n| October | Wet and humid | Medium | $$ | Wildlife spotting, safaris |\n| November | Wet and humid | Low | $ | Fishing, boat cruises |\n| December | Dry and sunny | Medium | $$ | Christmas and New Year's celebrations, safaris |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kampala City Festival | December | A celebration of Kampala's culture, music, and food |\n| Uganda Music Festival | August | A showcase of Ugandan music and dance |\n| Lake Victoria Fishing Festival | April | A fishing competition and celebration of Lake Victoria's fishing industry |\n| Ndaba Cultural Festival | July | A celebration of Uganda's cultural heritage and traditions |\n| Uganda Martyrs' Day | June | A national holiday commemorating the martyrdom of Uganda's Christian martyrs |\n| Kampala International Theatre Festival | November | A showcase of international and local theatre performances |\n| Jinja Festival | February | A celebration of Jinja's culture, music, and adventure activities |\n| Uganda Film Festival | September | A showcase of Ugandan and international films |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **northern region**, which includes Murchison Falls National Park, is best visited during the dry season, from December to February and June to August, when the weather is dry and wildlife is easier to spot.\n- The **western region**, which includes Queen Elizabeth National Park, is best visited during the dry season, from June to August and December to January, when the weather is dry and the wildlife is more abundant.\n- The **eastern region**, which includes Jinja and the **Lake Victoria** region, is best visited during the dry season, from December to February and June to August, when the weather is dry and the scenery is more picturesque.\n- The **Mount Elgon** and **Rwenzori Mountains** regions are best visited during the dry season, from June to August and December to January, when the weather is dry and the hiking trails are more accessible.\n- The **Kidepo Valley National Park** region is best visited during the dry season, from June to August and December to January, when the weather is dry and the wildlife is easier to spot.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your tour packages and accommodations well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to May and September to November, when prices are lower and the tourist attractions are less crowded.\n- Pack **waterproof gear** and **insect repellent**, as the wet season can be rainy and humid.\n- Avoid traveling during the **Easter** and **Christmas** holidays, when prices are higher and tourist attractions are more crowded.\n- Research and book your tours and activities with reputable and licensed operators to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.\n- Consider purchasing **travel insurance**, which can provide coverage for unexpected medical or travel-related expenses.",
