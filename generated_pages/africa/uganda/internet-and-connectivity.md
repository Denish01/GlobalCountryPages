[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Uganda has improved significantly over the years, with the average internet speed being around 10 Mbps download. However, there is still a significant urban-rural divide, with internet services being more reliable and faster in cities like Kampala and Entebbe compared to rural areas. In urban areas, you can expect to find 4G connectivity, while in rural areas, 2G and 3G networks are more common. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by power outages and network maintenance, which can be frequent in some areas.

Despite these challenges, the Ugandan government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with several initiatives aimed at increasing access to the internet, particularly in rural areas. This has led to an increase in the number of internet users in the country, with more people now having access to online services and information. However, the cost of internet services can still be a barrier for many people, particularly in rural areas where incomes are generally lower.
