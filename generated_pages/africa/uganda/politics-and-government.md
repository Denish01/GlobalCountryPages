[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Uganda is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President has significant powers, including the ability to appoint and dismiss ministers, as well as to dissolve the National Assembly. The legislative branch, known as the National Assembly, is composed of 529 members, with 353 elected by universal adult suffrage and 146 appointed by special interest groups. The National Assembly has the power to make laws, approve the budget, and exercise oversight over the executive branch. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court, and is responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly.

The system of government in Uganda is unitary, with a strong central government and limited powers granted to local governments. The country is divided into 134 districts, each with its own local government, but these districts have limited autonomy and are subject to the authority of the central government. The separation of powers between the branches of government is intended to provide checks and balances, but in practice, the executive branch has often dominated the other two branches.

The **presidential system** in Uganda has been criticized for concentrating too much power in the hands of the President, and for limiting the ability of the legislative and judicial branches to hold the executive branch accountable. However, the system has also been credited with providing stability and continuity, particularly during times of crisis.
