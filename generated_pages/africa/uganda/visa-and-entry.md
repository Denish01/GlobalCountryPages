# Uganda Visa & Entry Requirements

To enter Uganda, citizens of most countries require a visa, which can be obtained on arrival or in advance, depending on their nationality and purpose of visit.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Uganda before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of over 30 countries eligible for visa-free access, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an eVisa system. The country aims to promote tourism and business while maintaining national security. Citizens of countries that do not have visa-free access or are not eligible for a visa on arrival must apply for a visa at the Ugandan embassy or consulate in their home country.

The visa policy is designed to facilitate travel to Uganda while ensuring that visitors comply with the country's immigration regulations. The East African Community (EAC) member states, including Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi, have a more relaxed visa policy, with citizens of these countries eligible for visa-free access to Uganda.
