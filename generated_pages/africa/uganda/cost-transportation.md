[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda has a diverse range of transportation modes, including buses, taxis, minivans, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Kampala having a more developed system than other urban areas. Most people in Uganda get around using **matatus** (minivans) or **boda-bodas** (motorcycle taxis), which are affordable and widely available. However, the roads in Uganda can be challenging, especially during the rainy season, and traffic congestion is a common problem in major cities.

The main transportation modes in Uganda are designed to cater to the large population, with many people relying on public transport to get to work, school, or market. The **Uganda Transport Sector** has been growing rapidly, with investments in road infrastructure and public transportation systems. However, there is still a need for improvement, particularly in rural areas where access to transportation is limited. The government has been working to improve the transportation network, including the development of a **mass transit system** in Kampala, which is expected to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.
