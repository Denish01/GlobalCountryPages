[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Uganda has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including a growing economy, urbanization, and government investment in infrastructure. The market is characterized by a shortage of high-quality housing and commercial properties, particularly in urban areas such as Kampala. As a result, prices have been rising, with the average price per square meter in the capital city increasing by around 10% per annum. The market is also seeing an increase in demand for **mixed-use developments**, which combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces.

In terms of trends, there is a shift towards more modern and luxurious properties, particularly in the high-end segment. This is driven by the growing middle class and an increasing number of expatriates and foreigners investing in the country. The **urban-rural divide** is also a significant factor, with urban areas experiencing much faster growth and development than rural areas. However, there are also opportunities for investment in rural areas, particularly in the **agricultural sector**.

The government has implemented various initiatives to support the property market, including the introduction of new laws and regulations to simplify the process of buying and selling property. However, the market still faces challenges, including a lack of access to **financing** and a shortage of skilled labor.
