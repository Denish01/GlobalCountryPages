The cost of living in Uganda is lower compared to its neighboring countries, such as Kenya and Tanzania. A budget of $400-500 per month can provide a decent lifestyle, including shared accommodation, cooking most meals, and using public transportation. However, this budget would not allow for many luxuries, such as eating out or taking taxis. A mid-range lifestyle, with a budget of $700-900 per month, would provide more comfort, including a one-bedroom apartment in a central location, eating out occasionally, and using a mix of public and private transportation.\n\nThe cost of living in Uganda can vary depending on the location, with cities like Kampala and Entebbe tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Overall, Uganda offers a good balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for digital nomads, retirees, and students. However, the cost of living can still be challenging for some, especially those with limited financial resources or those who are used to a higher standard of living.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 100-150 | 200-300 | 400-600 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 100-150 | 150-250 | 250-400 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 30-50 | 50-100 | 100-150 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-400 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-400 | |\n| **Total** | **440-650** | **700-1,250** | **1,250-2,200** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nAt the budget level, daily life in Uganda would be relatively simple.
