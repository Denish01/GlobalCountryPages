[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Uganda's population size is significant in the context of East Africa, with the country accounting for about 10% of the region's total population. The population growth rate is relatively high, driven by a combination of factors including a high total fertility rate and declining mortality rates. Urbanization is also on the rise, with many Ugandans moving to cities such as Kampala in search of better economic opportunities. However, this trend also poses challenges, including strain on urban infrastructure and services. Migration patterns in Uganda are complex, with many people moving within the country or to neighboring countries in search of work, education, or refuge.

The population of Uganda is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that the country will reach a population of over 60 million by 2030. This growth will have significant implications for the country's development, including increased demand for services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. To address these challenges, the government of Uganda has implemented policies aimed at reducing population growth rates and improving access to family planning services.

Uganda's population is also characterized by a high proportion of young people, with over 70% of the population under the age of 30. This demographic profile presents both opportunities and challenges, as a large and growing youth population can be a driving force for economic development, but also requires significant investment in education, healthcare, and job creation.
