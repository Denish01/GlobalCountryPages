  "content": "Uganda's infrastructure is developing, with ongoing investments in roads, energy, and telecommunications, but still faces challenges in terms of quality and access, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 26% of population\nInternet Penetration: 22%\nRoad Network: 20,544 km, moderate quality with paved and unpaved sections\nRail Network: 1,244 km\nMajor Airports: 5\nMajor Ports: 1 major port on Lake Victoria, with limited international shipping\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nUganda's infrastructure development level is moderate, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications. The government has prioritized infrastructure development as a key driver of economic growth and poverty reduction. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in infrastructure access, with urban areas generally having better access to services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading roads, expanding electricity generation, and improving telecommunications services.\n\nDespite these efforts, Uganda's infrastructure still faces challenges in terms of quality and access. Many roads are in poor condition, and the rail network is limited and in need of upgrading. The country's energy sector is also characterized by frequent power outages and a reliance on expensive and polluting diesel generators. The government has set ambitious targets for increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation, but achieving these goals will require sustained investment and improvement in the efficiency of service delivery.\n\nUganda's infrastructure development is also hindered by limited funding and a reliance on external aid. The government has sought to mobilize private sector investment in infrastructure, but this has been slow to materialize. As a result, the country's infrastructure development is often dependent on external funding, which can be unpredictable and subject to conditionality.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 20,544 km | Moderate | 12% paved, 88% unpaved |\n| Railways | 1,244 km | Poor | Limited and in need of upgrading |\n| Airports | 5 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, but limited international connections |\n| Ports | 1 major port on Lake Victoria | Moderate | Limited international shipping, but important for regional trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Hydroelectric power** is the main source of electricity generation, accounting for over 80% of total generation\n- The country's electricity grid is characterized by frequent **power outages**, with an average of 10 hours of downtime per month\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are being promoted as a way to increase energy access and reduce reliance on expensive and polluting diesel generators\n- The government has set a target of increasing electricity access to 30% of the population by 2025, but achieving this goal will require significant investment in generation and transmission infrastructure\n- **Energy efficiency** measures, such as the use of energy-efficient lighting and appliances, are being promoted as a way to reduce energy consumption and mitigate the impact of power outages\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern, with many urban residents relying on bottled or filtered water due to concerns about the quality of tap water\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with only 34% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on traditional sources such as wells and springs\n- The government has set a target of increasing access to safe water and sanitation to 80% of the population by 2030, but achieving this goal will require significant investment in water and sanitation infrastructure\n- **Water conservation** measures, such as the use of rainwater harvesting and water-efficient appliances, are being promoted as a way to reduce water consumption and mitigate the impact of droughts and water shortages\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services\n- **Fiber optic** cables are being rolled out to major towns and cities, providing high-speed internet access to businesses and individuals\n- **4G/5G rollout** is ongoing, with several mobile network operators launching 4G services in major towns and cities\n- **Postal services** are limited, with many communities relying on informal networks to send and receive mail and packages\n- **Telecommunications regulation** is overseen by the Uganda Communications Commission, which is responsible for promoting competition and protecting consumer rights in the telecommunications sector\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Uganda Transport Infrastructure Development Project** aims to upgrade over 1,000 km of roads and improve the country's transport network\n- The **Lake Victoria Transport Project** aims to improve the efficiency and safety of transport on Lake Victoria, which is an important route for regional trade\n- The **Uganda Energy Access Scale-Up Project** aims to increase access to electricity in rural areas through the use of off-grid solar systems and mini-grids\n- The **Kampala Water and Sanitation Project** aims to improve access to safe water and sanitation in the capital city, which is home to over 1.5 million people\n- The **National Data Backbone Project** aims to establish a high-speed data backbone to connect major towns and cities and promote the development of the digital economy",
