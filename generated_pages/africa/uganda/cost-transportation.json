The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Kampala having a more developed system than other urban areas. Most people in Uganda get around using **matatus** (minivans) or **boda-bodas** (motorcycle taxis), which are affordable and widely available. However, the roads in Uganda can be challenging, especially during the rainy season, and traffic congestion is a common problem in major cities.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Uganda are designed to cater to the large population, with many people relying on public transport to get to work, school, or market. The **Uganda Transport Sector** has been growing rapidly, with investments in road infrastructure and public transportation systems. However, there is still a need for improvement, particularly in rural areas where access to transportation is limited. The government has been working to improve the transportation network, including the development of a **mass transit system** in Kampala, which is expected to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Uganda |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.50 | N/A | Extensive routes, frequent services |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-$2 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1-$2 | $0.30-$0.60 | $3-$6 | SafeBoda, Uber available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.40 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, including fuel and insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, mainly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Frequent services, affordable prices |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Limited routes, expensive option |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider using **public transportation** or **ride-hailing apps**, which are often cheaper than metered taxis.\n- Use reputable ride-hailing apps like **SafeBoda** or **Uber** to ensure a safe and reliable journey.\n- When using **matatus** or **boda-bodas**, always **negotiate the fare** before you start your journey to avoid being overcharged.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Consider **renting a car** for long-distance journeys, but be aware of the **road conditions** and **traffic rules** in Uganda.\n- Download **transport apps** like **Google Maps** or **Waze** to help navigate the roads and avoid traffic congestion.",
