The country has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, with a GDP growth rate of around 7-8% per annum. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a strong agricultural sector, an emerging manufacturing industry, and a growing services sector. Despite this growth, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a reliance on a limited number of export commodities.\n\nThe Ivorian economy is classified as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The government has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting economic development, including investment in infrastructure and the creation of special economic zones. However, the economy is still heavily reliant on the agricultural sector, which accounts for around 20% of GDP. The country is also rich in natural resources, including gold, diamonds, and oil, which provides a significant source of revenue for the government.\n\nIvory Coast's economic trajectory is expected to continue on a positive path, driven by a combination of factors, including a growing population, an emerging middle class, and significant investment in infrastructure. However, the economy is still vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in the global economic environment. To mitigate these risks, the government is promoting economic diversification, including the development of the manufacturing and services sectors.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Ivory Coast is a major producer of cocoa, coffee, and cotton, with a significant portion of the population employed in the sector |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | The country is rich in natural resources, including gold, diamonds, and oil, with a number of international mining companies operating in the country |\n| Manufacturing | 15% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is emerging, with a focus on textile production, food processing, and construction materials |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | The services sector is the largest contributor to GDP, with a growing financial sector, a significant tourism industry, and a developing IT sector |\n| Construction | 5% of GDP | The construction sector is growing, driven by significant investment in infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Cocoa**: Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, with the majority of exports going to Europe and Asia\n- **Coffee**: The country is also a significant producer of coffee, with exports going to a number of countries, including the United States and Germany\n- **Palm oil**: Ivory Coast is a significant producer of palm oil, with exports going to a number of countries, including China and India\n- **Cotton**: The country is also a significant producer of cotton, with exports going to a number of countries, including China and Bangladesh\n- **Gold**: Ivory Coast is also a significant producer of gold, with exports going to a number of countries, including South Africa and Switzerland\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery**: The country imports a significant amount of machinery, including equipment for the manufacturing and construction sectors\n- **Vehicles**: Ivory Coast also imports a significant number of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and buses\n- **Fuel**: The country imports a significant amount of fuel, including petroleum products and natural gas\n- **Electronics**: The country also imports a significant amount of electronics, including computers, phones, and televisions\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: Ivory Coast imports a significant amount of pharmaceuticals, including medicines and medical equipment\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- **France**: France is one of Ivory Coast's largest trading partners, with significant trade in goods and services\n- **China**: China is also a significant trading partner, with a growing trade relationship in recent years\n- **Netherlands**: The Netherlands is also a significant trading partner, with a focus on trade in goods, including machinery and electronics\n- **Germany**: Germany is also a significant trading partner, with a focus on trade in goods, including vehicles and machinery\n- **United States**: The United States is also a significant trading partner, with a focus on trade in goods, including machinery and electronics\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country has a significant network of roads, including a number of major highways that connect the capital city to other major cities\n- The port city of Abidjan is a major hub for trade, with a significant amount of cargo passing through the port each year\n- The country has a number of airports, including the Félix Houphouët-Boigny International Airport, which is a major hub for air travel in the region\n- Internet penetration is relatively low, at around 25% of the population, but is growing rapidly\n- Mobile phone penetration is much higher, at around 80% of the population, with a number of major mobile phone operators providing services in the country\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nIvory Coast's economic outlook is positive, with a growing economy and a number of significant investment projects in the pipeline.
