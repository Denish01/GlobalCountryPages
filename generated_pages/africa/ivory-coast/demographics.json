This growth is driven by a high total fertility rate of 4.4 children per woman, which is one of the highest in the world. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 20.1 years, and is expected to continue growing in the coming years. The country's urban population is approximately 54%, with many people migrating to cities such as Abidjan and Yamoussoukro in search of better economic opportunities. Urbanization is a significant trend in the Ivory Coast, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of work, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe Ivory Coast's population is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the country and across its borders. Many people migrate to neighboring countries such as Ghana and Liberia in search of work, while others move to Europe and other parts of the world in search of better economic opportunities. This migration has contributed to the country's cultural diversity, with many people bringing new ideas, customs, and traditions back to the Ivory Coast.\n\nThe Ivory Coast's population is also affected by a number of challenges, including poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and high levels of infant mortality.
