[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Ivory Coast's political system is based on the principles of **democracy** and **separation of powers**, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The President, who is directly elected by the people, serves as the head of state and head of government, and is responsible for appointing the government and overseeing the implementation of national policies. The National Assembly, which is composed of 255 members elected by proportional representation, has the power to pass laws and approve the government's budget. The judicial branch, which is headed by the Supreme Court, is responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the Constitution.

The Ivory Coast's system of government is **unitary**, meaning that power is concentrated in the central government, and the country is divided into 31 regions, each with its own regional council and governor. The government has implemented a number of **decentralization** reforms in recent years, aimed at giving more power to local authorities and promoting regional development. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of **poverty**, **inequality**, and **corruption**, which can undermine the effectiveness of the government and the rule of law.

The Ivory Coast has a **multiparty system**, with a number of political parties competing for power and representation in the National Assembly. The two main parties are the **Rally of the Republicans** (RDR) and the **Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire** (PDCI), which have historically dominated the country's politics. However, in recent years, other parties have emerged, including the **Ivorian Popular Front** (FPI) and the **Union for Democracy and Peace in Côte d'Ivoire** (UDPCI), which have challenged the dominance of the traditional parties.
