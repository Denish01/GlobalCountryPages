[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast has two main international airports: Félix Houphouët-Boigny International Airport in Abidjan and Port Bouet Airport, which is also located near Abidjan. These airports receive flights from major hubs in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, with direct flights available from cities like Paris, Brussels, and Dubai. Overland entry points are available from neighboring countries, including Liberia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ghana, although the quality of roads and border crossings can vary greatly.

Travelers can enter Ivory Coast by land through several border crossings, including the ones at Danane, Man, and Ouangolodougou from neighboring countries. However, be prepared for potential delays and complications at border crossings, and make sure to research the required documents and procedures in advance. Additionally, consider hiring a private driver or joining a guided tour to help navigate the complexities of overland travel in the region.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting Abidjan to major cities like San-Pédro, Man, and Bouaké. The main domestic airline is Air Côte d'Ivoire, which operates a small fleet of aircraft and offers relatively frequent flights between these destinations. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs can range from $50 to $200 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast has a limited rail network, with a single line connecting Abidjan to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, and another line connecting Abidjan to San-Pédro.
