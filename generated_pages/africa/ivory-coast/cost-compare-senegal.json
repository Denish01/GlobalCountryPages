Ivory Coast has a relatively high GDP per capita, driven by its strong agricultural sector, while Senegal's economy is more diversified, with a growing service sector. In terms of cost of living, Ivory Coast tends to be cheaper than Senegal, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.

Ivory Coast has a larger economy and a more developed industrial sector, which can lead to higher wages and a lower cost of living.
