The country's culinary landscape is shaped by its colonial past, as well as its geographical position, which has facilitated the exchange of ingredients, spices, and cooking techniques with neighboring countries. As a result, Ivory Coast's cuisine is characterized by the use of local ingredients such as peanuts, plantains, and cassava, combined with imported spices and seasonings. Regional variations also play a significant role in shaping the country's cuisine, with different ethnic groups contributing their unique cooking traditions and specialty dishes.\n\nThe cuisine in Ivory Coast is also defined by the country's rich cultural heritage, with food playing a central role in social gatherings, celebrations, and everyday life. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and the preparation and sharing of food is a significant aspect of Ivorian culture. The country's cuisine is also heavily influenced by its Muslim and Christian populations, with many dishes adapted to accommodate halal and other dietary requirements.\n\nIn terms of key ingredients, Ivory Coast's cuisine relies heavily on staples such as rice, plantains, and cassava, which are often combined with proteins like chicken, beef, and fish. The use of peanuts and other nuts is also common, particularly in sauces and stews. Spices and seasonings, such as cumin, coriander, and chili peppers, add depth and flavor to many dishes, while imported ingredients like tomatoes and onions have become integral components of Ivorian cuisine.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Foutou | Main Course | Boiled and pounded cassava or yams, often served with a sauce | Abidjan restaurants |\n| Kedjenou | Stew | Chicken and vegetable stew cooked in a clay pot | Rural areas, traditional restaurants |\n| Mafé | Stew | Meat or fish stew cooked in a peanut sauce | Urban restaurants, street food stalls |\n| Poulet Braisé | Main Course | Braised chicken cooked in a tomato-based sauce | Abidjan restaurants |\n| Thieboudienne | Rice Dish | Mixed rice dish made with fish, meat, and vegetables | Coastal towns, seafood restaurants |\n| Attiéké | Side Dish | Fermented cassava dough, often served with grilled meats or stews | Street food stalls, markets |\n| Alloco | Side Dish | Fried plantains, often served with grilled meats or stews | Street food stalls, markets |\n| Groundnut Stew | Stew | Peanut-based stew made with meat or fish, and vegetables | Rural areas, traditional restaurants |\n| Akara | Breakfast Dish | Fried bean cakes, often served with a spicy sauce | Street food stalls, markets |\n| Bangui | Dessert | Sweet plantain dish, often served with a sprinkle of sugar | Street food stalls, markets |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Alloco**: fried plantains, often served with grilled meats or stews (1-2 USD)\n- **Attiéké**: fermented cassava dough, often served with grilled meats or stews (1-2 USD)\n- **Akara**: fried bean cakes, often served with a spicy sauce (0.50-1 USD)\n- **Bangui**: sweet plantain dish, often served with a sprinkle of sugar (0.50-1 USD)\n- **Mangoes**: fresh mangoes, often sold by street vendors (0.25-0.50 USD)\n- **Plantain Chips**: fried plantain slices, often served as a snack (0.50-1 USD)\n- **Grilled Meats**: grilled meats, such as chicken or beef, often served with a side of **Attiéké** or **Alloco** (2-5 USD)\n- **Fried Fish**: fried fish, often served with a side of **Attiéké** or **Alloco** (3-5 USD)\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Ginger Beer**: a spicy, fermented drink made from ginger (1-2 USD)\n- **Fresh Juice**: fresh juice made from local fruits, such as mangoes or oranges (1-2 USD)\n- **Ivorian Coffee**: strong, rich coffee made from locally-grown coffee beans (0.50-1 USD)\n- **Tea**: sweet, spiced tea made from black tea leaves (0.25-0.50 USD)\n- **Palm Wine**: fermented palm sap, often served as a traditional drink (1-2 USD)\n- **Beer**: locally-brewed beer, such as **Ivorian Lager** (2-3 USD)\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with Hands**: it is common to eat with your hands, especially when eating traditional dishes like **Foutou**\n- **Respect for Elders**: show respect to elders by offering them the best food and drink\n- **Sharing Food**: sharing food is a significant aspect of Ivorian culture, especially during social gatherings\n- **Tipping**: 5-10% of the total bill is customary in restaurants\n- **Dress Code**: dress modestly, especially when eating in traditional or rural settings\n- **Reservation Culture**: reservations are not always necessary, but can be helpful in popular restaurants\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Markets**: try traditional dishes and street food at local markets, such as the **Grand Marché** in Abidjan\n- **Food Courts**: food courts, such as the **Food Court** in the **Plateau** district of Abidjan, offer a variety of local and international cuisine\n- **Restaurants**: try traditional Ivorian cuisine at restaurants, such as **Le Comptoir** in Abidjan\n- **Street Food Stalls**: try street food, such as **Alloco** and **Attiéké**, at street food stalls\n- **Traditional Eateries**: try traditional dishes, such as **Foutou** and **Kedjenou**, at traditional eateries\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Grand Marché**: a large market in Abidjan, offering a variety of traditional dishes and street food\n- **Marché de Treichville**: a market in the **Treichville** district of Abidjan, offering a variety of local produce and traditional dishes\n- **Festival of the Sea**: a festival in the coastal town of **Grand-Bassam**, celebrating seafood and traditional cuisine\n- **Ivorian Food Festival**: a festival in Abidjan, showcasing traditional Ivorian cuisine and street food\n- **Cocody Market**: a market in the **Cocody** district of Abidjan, offering a variety of local produce, traditional dishes, and street food",
