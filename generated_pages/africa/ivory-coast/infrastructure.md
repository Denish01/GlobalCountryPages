[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast's infrastructure development level is generally considered to be moderate, with significant progress made in recent years, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors. The government has invested heavily in road construction, with a focus on improving connectivity between major cities and ports. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by limited funding and a lack of private sector investment.

Despite these challenges, Ivory Coast has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing a number of initiatives aimed at improving the business environment and attracting foreign investment. The country has also made significant progress in terms of regional integration, with membership in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).

The government's infrastructure development strategy is focused on improving the country's competitiveness and reducing poverty, with a particular emphasis on increasing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The strategy also aims to improve the country's transportation network, including roads, railways, and ports, in order to facilitate trade and economic growth.
