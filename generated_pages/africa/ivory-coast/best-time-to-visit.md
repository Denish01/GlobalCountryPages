[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by dry and relatively cool weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C (72°F to 82°F). This is the best time to visit Ivory Coast, as the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, wildlife watching, and exploring the country's beautiful beaches. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for travel.

The country can be divided into four climate zones: the coastal zone, the forest zone, the savanna zone, and the mountain zone. The coastal zone, which includes the capital city Yamoussoukro, has a humid tropical climate, with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The forest zone, which covers the southern part of the country, has a tropical rainforest climate, with high temperatures and high rainfall throughout the year. The savanna zone, which covers the northern part of the country, has a tropical savanna climate, with high temperatures and a dry season from December to May. The mountain zone, which includes the western part of the country, has a temperate climate, with cooler temperatures and lower humidity than the rest of the country.

The seasons in Ivory Coast have a significant impact on travel, as the wet season can make roads impassable and outdoor activities difficult. The dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for exploring the country's diverse landscapes and cultures, and is the best time to visit Ivory Coast's national parks, beaches, and cities.
