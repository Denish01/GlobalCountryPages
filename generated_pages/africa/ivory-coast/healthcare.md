[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast's healthcare system is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, but the private sector is growing, with many private clinics and hospitals offering higher quality care, especially in urban areas like Abidjan and Yamoussoukro. The quality of care varies significantly between public and private providers, with private facilities generally offering better equipment, staff, and services. However, access to healthcare is limited in rural areas, where many people rely on traditional medicine and face significant challenges in accessing modern healthcare services.

The urban-rural divide is a significant challenge in Ivory Coast's healthcare system, with many rural areas lacking basic healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and trained healthcare professionals. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the deployment of community health workers and the establishment of rural health centers. Despite these efforts, much work remains to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas.

The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, including setting policies, regulating healthcare providers, and providing funding for public healthcare services. The ministry has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the deployment of digital health technologies.
