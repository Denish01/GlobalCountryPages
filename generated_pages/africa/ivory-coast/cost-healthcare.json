The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, with limited resources and infrastructure. However, public healthcare is often more affordable, with costs subsidized by the government. Locals typically rely on public healthcare for basic medical needs, while foreigners and affluent individuals often opt for private healthcare for better quality and more comprehensive services. Having health insurance is recommended, as it can help cover the costs of private healthcare and provide access to better facilities and specialists.\n\nThe healthcare system in Ivory Coast can be challenging for foreigners to navigate, especially for those who do not speak French. Many private hospitals and clinics cater to foreigners and offer high-quality services, but at a higher cost. Some private healthcare providers may also offer package deals or membership programs that include access to medical services, laboratory tests, and other benefits. It is essential to research and choose a reputable healthcare provider, whether public or private, to ensure that you receive quality medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and clinic |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and clinic |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by clinic and services offered |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by clinic and services offered |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by clinic and laboratory |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and services required |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and room type |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$1,000 | Prices vary by procedure and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $200-$1,000 | Prices vary by hospital and services required |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and laboratory |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and laboratory |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Comprehensive medical services, including specialist consultations and laboratory tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | International coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$10 per prescription\n- Prescription rules vary by medication and clinic, but generally require a doctor's prescription\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may not always be of high quality\n- Some medications may be counterfeit or of poor quality, so it is essential to choose a reputable pharmacy\n- Prices for medications can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number 180 or 185 for assistance.
