  "content": "Healthcare in Ivory Coast is a mixed system that combines public and private providers, with varying levels of quality and access, especially between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 175\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nIvory Coast's healthcare system is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, but the private sector is growing, with many private clinics and hospitals offering higher quality care, especially in urban areas like Abidjan and Yamoussoukro. The quality of care varies significantly between public and private providers, with private facilities generally offering better equipment, staff, and services. However, access to healthcare is limited in rural areas, where many people rely on traditional medicine and face significant challenges in accessing modern healthcare services.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is a significant challenge in Ivory Coast's healthcare system, with many rural areas lacking basic healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and trained healthcare professionals. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the deployment of community health workers and the establishment of rural health centers. Despite these efforts, much work remains to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas.\n\nThe **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, including setting policies, regulating healthcare providers, and providing funding for public healthcare services. The ministry has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the deployment of digital health technologies.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Yopougon | Abidjan | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinique des Nations | Abidjan | Private | General medicine, cardiology, oncology | Yes |\n| Hôpital Général de Douala | Abidjan | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Limited |\n| Polyclinique Internationale Sainte-Anne-Marie | Abidjan | Private | General medicine, obstetrics, gynecology | Yes |\n| Centre Médical de Yamoussoukro | Yamoussoukro | Public | General medicine, pediatrics, dental care | Limited |\n| Hôpital Privé de la Polyclinique | San-Pedro | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all visitors and expats, as it provides access to higher quality private healthcare services.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including the national health insurance scheme, which provides coverage for public healthcare services.\n- **Expats** should consider purchasing international health insurance that covers them globally, including in Ivory Coast.\n- **Costs** for private health insurance vary depending on the provider and level of coverage, but expect to pay around 500,000-1,000,000 XOF per year.\n- **Group insurance plans** are available for companies and organizations, providing coverage for employees and their dependents.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors, as it provides coverage for emergency medical evacuations and other travel-related risks.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** include international pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, as well as local brands.\n- **Costs** for medications vary depending on the type and brand, but expect to pay around 5,000-10,000 XOF per prescription.\n- **Pharmacy access** is moderate, with many pharmacies available in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for all visitors, as Ivory Coast is a high-risk country for yellow fever.\n- **Malaria** is a significant health risk, especially in rural areas, and visitors should take precautions like using insecticide-treated bed nets and wearing insect repellent.\n- **Hepatitis A and B vaccinations** are recommended for all visitors, as these diseases are prevalent in Ivory Coast.\n- **Rabies vaccination** is recommended for visitors who will be working with animals or spending time in rural areas.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and visitors should avoid drinking tap water and instead use bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and visitors should avoid eating undercooked meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Ivory Coast, but some private hospitals and clinics offer specialized services like cosmetic surgery and dental care.\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, dental care, and ophthalmology.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Clinique des Nations and the Polyclinique Internationale Sainte-Anne-Marie, which offer high-quality services and modern facilities.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many procedures costing 50-70% less than in Western countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 175, which connects callers to the national emergency services.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is limited, and visitors should consider using private ambulance services or taxis in emergency situations.\n- **Nearest hospitals** vary depending on location, but visitors should research the nearest hospital or clinic before arriving in Ivory Coast.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted to the insurance provider as soon as possible, with supporting documentation like medical records and receipts.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in severe cases, and visitors should consider purchasing travel insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations.",
