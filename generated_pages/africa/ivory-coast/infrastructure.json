  "content": "The infrastructure in Ivory Coast is developing, with recent investments in roads, energy, and telecommunications, but still faces challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation remains limited.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 64% of population\nInternet Penetration: 46%\nRoad Network: 81,996 km, with 5,600 km paved\nRail Network: 660 km\nMajor Airports: 2 international, 8 domestic\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nIvory Coast's infrastructure development level is generally considered to be moderate, with significant progress made in recent years, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors. The government has invested heavily in road construction, with a focus on improving connectivity between major cities and ports. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by limited funding and a lack of private sector investment.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ivory Coast has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing a number of initiatives aimed at improving the business environment and attracting foreign investment. The country has also made significant progress in terms of regional integration, with membership in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).\n\nThe government's infrastructure development strategy is focused on improving the country's competitiveness and reducing poverty, with a particular emphasis on increasing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The strategy also aims to improve the country's transportation network, including roads, railways, and ports, in order to facilitate trade and economic growth.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 81,996 km | Moderate | 5,600 km paved, with plans to upgrade and expand the network |\n| Railways | 660 km | Poor | Limited passenger and freight services, with plans to rehabilitate and expand the network |\n| Airports | 10 | Good | 2 international airports, with plans to upgrade and expand airport infrastructure |\n| Ports | 2 | Good | 2 major ports, with plans to upgrade and expand port infrastructure |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Ivory Coast's power generation is primarily based on **thermal energy**, with a growing share of **renewable energy** sources, including hydro and solar power.\n- The country's electricity grid is relatively reliable, with some **outages** and **load shedding** during peak periods.\n- The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at increasing access to electricity, including the **rural electrification program**.\n- Ivory Coast has set a target of increasing the share of **renewable energy** in the energy mix to 30% by 2030.\n- The country is also exploring opportunities for **regional power trade**, including membership in the West African Power Pool (WAPP).\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **tap water** is limited, particularly in rural areas, where many households rely on **traditional water sources**.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many households lacking access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving access to **water and sanitation**, including the **water and sanitation program**.\n- Ivory Coast has set a target of increasing access to **improved water sources** to 80% by 2030.\n- The country is also working to improve **wastewater management**, including the construction of new wastewater treatment plants.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread, with a number of mobile operators providing services across the country.\n- **Fiber optic** connectivity is limited, but is being expanded, particularly in urban areas.\n- The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at increasing access to **broadband**, including the **broadband strategy**.\n- Ivory Coast has set a target of increasing **internet penetration** to 60% by 2030.\n- The country is also working to improve **postal services**, including the introduction of new postal products and services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government is implementing a number of major infrastructure projects, including the **Abidjan-Lagos highway** and the **San-Pedro port expansion**.\n- The **West African Gas Pipeline** project is also underway, with the aim of increasing access to natural gas and reducing dependence on imported fuels.\n- Ivory Coast has received funding from a number of international organizations, including the **World Bank** and the **African Development Bank**, to support infrastructure development.\n- The government is also working to attract private sector investment, including through **public-private partnerships**.\n- The country is expected to benefit from a number of regional infrastructure initiatives, including the **African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)**.",
