[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Ivory Coast is primarily French-based, with French being the language of instruction. The system is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education, with six years of compulsory education. Public education is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private education, with overcrowded classrooms and limited resources being common issues. However, there are also some high-quality private schools available, particularly in the larger cities, which offer a more comprehensive education and better facilities. International schools are also available, particularly in Abidjan, which offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.

The quality of education in Ivory Coast can vary significantly depending on the institution and location. In general, urban areas tend to have better-equipped schools and more qualified teachers, while rural areas often struggle with limited resources and inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the Ivorian government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve teacher training and curriculum development. For expatriates and international students, there are several options available, including private and international schools, which can provide a high-quality education and a more familiar learning environment.
