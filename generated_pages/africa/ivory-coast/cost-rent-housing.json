The rental market is relatively competitive, with tenants having a range of options to choose from, including apartments, houses, and shared accommodations. Typical lease terms in Ivory Coast range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with the government implementing measures to regulate the rental market and prevent exploitation. Compared to regional neighbors, Ivory Coast's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Ghana but higher than in neighboring Liberia.\n\nThe housing market in Ivory Coast is also influenced by the country's economic growth, with the GDP per capita (PPP) of $7,669 indicating a relatively stable economy. However, the **inflation rate** of 3.5% and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 32.0% can impact the affordability of housing.
