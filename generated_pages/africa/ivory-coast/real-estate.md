[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Ivory Coast is experiencing a steady growth, driven by the country's economic development and increasing demand for housing. The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a focus on urban areas such as Abidjan and Yamoussoukro. The price trajectory is generally upward, with an average annual increase of 5-10%. However, the market can be volatile, and prices may fluctuate depending on factors such as location, infrastructure development, and economic conditions. Urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, with prices ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 per square meter.

The government has implemented various initiatives to promote the property market, including the creation of a **real estate investment trust (REIT)** and the development of new infrastructure projects. These initiatives have contributed to the growth of the market, making it an attractive option for investors. Additionally, the country's strategic location and natural resources have made it an important hub for trade and commerce in West Africa.

The market is also experiencing a trend towards more modern and luxurious properties, with many new developments and renovations taking place in urban areas. This trend is driven by the increasing demand for high-quality housing and the growing middle class. However, the market still faces challenges such as a lack of affordable housing options and limited access to financing for many buyers.
