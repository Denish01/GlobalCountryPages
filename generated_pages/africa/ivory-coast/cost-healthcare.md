[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast has a mixed healthcare system that includes both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, with limited resources and infrastructure. However, public healthcare is often more affordable, with costs subsidized by the government. Locals typically rely on public healthcare for basic medical needs, while foreigners and affluent individuals often opt for private healthcare for better quality and more comprehensive services. Having health insurance is recommended, as it can help cover the costs of private healthcare and provide access to better facilities and specialists.

The healthcare system in Ivory Coast can be challenging for foreigners to navigate, especially for those who do not speak French. Many private hospitals and clinics cater to foreigners and offer high-quality services, but at a higher cost. Some private healthcare providers may also offer package deals or membership programs that include access to medical services, laboratory tests, and other benefits. It is essential to research and choose a reputable healthcare provider, whether public or private, to ensure that you receive quality medical care.
