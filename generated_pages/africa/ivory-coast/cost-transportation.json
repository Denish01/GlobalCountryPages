The main transportation modes in Ivory Coast include buses, taxis, and minibuses, also known as **gbakas**. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Abidjan, the largest city, having a more comprehensive network than other cities. Most people in Ivory Coast get around using public transportation, with buses and minibuses being the most affordable options. However, the roads in Ivory Coast can be congested, and traffic jams are common, especially in urban areas.\n\nIn addition to public transportation, many people in Ivory Coast use private vehicles, including cars and motorcycles. The country's roads are generally in good condition, but driving in Ivory Coast can be challenging due to the lack of traffic rules and the presence of pedestrians and animals on the roads. Despite these challenges, Ivory Coast has a relatively high rate of car ownership, with many people relying on private vehicles for transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $15-$25 | Good coverage in Abidjan, limited in other cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.50 | N/A | Extensive network, but can be crowded |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$2.00 | $20-$30 | Limited routes, but reliable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.50-$3.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Yango and Bolt are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00-$1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in urban areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, but can be expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Depending on the route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Typical route, such as Abidjan to San-Pedro |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, but a scenic option |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or minibuses, which are affordable and widely available.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Yango and Bolt for convenient and relatively affordable transportation.\n- Always negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting your journey, as they may not always use meters.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for long-distance travel, as it can be more convenient and flexible than public transportation.\n- Always wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle, as road safety can be a concern in Ivory Coast.",
