However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better infrastructure than rural areas. The costs of utilities in Ivory Coast can fluctuate, mainly due to changes in global fuel prices and government subsidies. Additionally, there can be seasonal variations in utility costs, with higher electricity and water consumption during the dry season (November to May) and lower consumption during the wet season (June to October).\n\nThe stability of utility costs in Ivory Coast is also affected by the country's economic performance, with inflation rates influencing the prices of utilities. According to the World Bank, the inflation rate in Ivory Coast was 3.5% in 2024, which can impact the cost of utilities and other essential services. Overall, it is essential to factor in these fluctuations and seasonal variations when budgeting for utility costs in Ivory Coast.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | (propane or charcoal) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in rent or separate) |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$85** | **$120** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | MTN, Orange |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 60-100 Mbps | MTN, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | MTN, Orange, Moov |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | MTN, Orange, Moov |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | MTN, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. StarTimes, Canal+) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Ivory Coast, it is recommended to contact the local providers (e.g. CIE for electricity, SODECI for water) and provide the necessary documents, such as a rental agreement and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely used in Ivory Coast, allowing households to control their energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.\n- For internet services, MTN and Orange are two of the most popular providers, offering a range of plans and bundles to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it is essential to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of promotional offers and discounts from service providers.\n- It is also recommended to regularly check and compare prices among different providers to ensure the best rates and services.",
