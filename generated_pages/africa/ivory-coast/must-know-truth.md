# The Truth About Ivory Coast - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
The Ivory Coast, officially known as Côte d'Ivoire, has a rich and diverse history that spans over a thousand years. The area was first inhabited by various indigenous groups, including the Baoulé and the Senoufo, before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1844, the French established a protectorate over the region, and by the late 19th century, the Ivory Coast had become a French colony. The French exploited the colony's natural resources, including ivory, gold, and coffee, and introduced new crops such as cocoa and rubber.

The Ivory Coast gained independence from France on August 7, 1960, with Félix Houphouët-Boigny as its first president. Houphouët-Boigny ruled the country for over three decades, implementing policies that promoted economic growth and modernization. During this period, the Ivory Coast experienced rapid economic development, driven by the production and export of cocoa, coffee, and other crops. The country also became a hub for regional trade and commerce, with the city of Abidjan emerging as a major economic center.

In the 1980s, the Ivory Coast faced significant economic challenges, including a decline in global commodity prices and a growing debt burden. The country's economy was also affected by political instability, including a military coup in 1999 and a civil war that lasted from 2002 to 2007. Despite these challenges, the Ivory Coast has continued to grow and develop, with a diverse economy and a rich cultural heritage.
