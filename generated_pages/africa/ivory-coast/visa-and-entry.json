[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nIvory Coast has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens from most countries to obtain a visa before entering the country. However, citizens from a few countries are eligible for visa-free access or can obtain a visa on arrival. The country's visa policy is designed to promote tourism and business while ensuring national security. Currently, citizens from about 20 countries, including some African and European nations, can enter Ivory Coast without a visa.\n\nThe Ivory Coast government has implemented an eVisa system to facilitate the visa application process for eligible citizens. This system allows applicants to submit their visa applications online and receive their visas via email. The eVisa is typically processed within 48 hours, and it is valid for a single entry into the country. Visitors who plan to stay in Ivory Coast for an extended period or for purposes other than tourism or business may need to apply for a different type of visa.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | eVisa/Tourist | 90 days | Must apply online before arrival |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | eVisa/Tourist | 90 days | Must apply online before arrival |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | eVisa/Tourist | 90 days | Must apply online before arrival, except for French citizens who are visa-free |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | eVisa/Tourist | 90 days | Must apply online before arrival |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | eVisa/Tourist | 90 days | Must apply online before arrival |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa/Tourist | 90 days | Must apply online before arrival |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | eVisa/Tourist | 90 days | Must apply online before arrival |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for an eVisa or a tourist visa, which is typically valid for 90 days.
