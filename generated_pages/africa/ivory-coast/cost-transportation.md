[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast has a relatively developed transportation network, with a mix of public and private modes of transport available. The main transportation modes in Ivory Coast include buses, taxis, and minibuses, also known as **gbakas**. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Abidjan, the largest city, having a more comprehensive network than other cities. Most people in Ivory Coast get around using public transportation, with buses and minibuses being the most affordable options. However, the roads in Ivory Coast can be congested, and traffic jams are common, especially in urban areas.

In addition to public transportation, many people in Ivory Coast use private vehicles, including cars and motorcycles. The country's roads are generally in good condition, but driving in Ivory Coast can be challenging due to the lack of traffic rules and the presence of pedestrians and animals on the roads. Despite these challenges, Ivory Coast has a relatively high rate of car ownership, with many people relying on private vehicles for transportation.
