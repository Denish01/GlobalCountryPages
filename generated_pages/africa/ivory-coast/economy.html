        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Ivory Coast has a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $2,013. The country has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, with a GDP growth rate of around 7-8% per annum. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a strong agricultural sector, an emerging manufacturing industry, and a growing services sector. Despite this growth, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a reliance on a limited number of export commodities.</p>
        <p>The Ivorian economy is classified as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The government has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting economic development, including investment in infrastructure and the creation of special economic zones. However, the economy is still heavily reliant on the agricultural sector, which accounts for around 20% of GDP. The country is also rich in natural resources, including gold, diamonds, and oil, which provides a significant source of revenue for the government.</p>
        <p>Ivory Coast's economic trajectory is expected to continue on a positive path, driven by a combination of factors, including a growing population, an emerging middle class, and significant investment in infrastructure. However, the economy is still vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in the global economic environment. To mitigate these risks, the government is promoting economic diversification, including the development of the manufacturing and services sectors.</p>
