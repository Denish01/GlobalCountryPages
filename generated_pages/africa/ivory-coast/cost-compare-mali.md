[SECTION] Overview: Ivory Coast vs Mali [/SECTION]
Ivory Coast and Mali are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Ivory Coast has a relatively strong economy, driven by its agricultural sector, particularly cocoa production, while Mali's economy is more diversified, with a significant mining sector. The cost of living in Ivory Coast is generally higher than in Mali, due to its stronger economy and higher demand for goods and services. However, Mali's lower cost of living can be attributed to its lower labor costs and lower prices for basic commodities.

The overall cost of living difference between the two countries is around 20-30%, with Ivory Coast being the more expensive option. This is reflected in the prices of housing, food, transportation, and other essential expenses. For example, a one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Abidjan, Ivory Coast's largest city, can cost around $400-500 per month, while a similar apartment in Bamako, Mali's capital, can cost around $200-300 per month. This significant difference in housing costs can have a major impact on the overall cost of living for expats, students, and other individuals living in these countries.
