The utility infrastructure in Ivory Coast is relatively developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better infrastructure than rural areas. The costs of utilities in Ivory Coast can fluctuate, mainly due to changes in global fuel prices and government subsidies. Additionally, there can be seasonal variations in utility costs, with higher electricity and water consumption during the dry season (November to May) and lower consumption during the wet season (June to October).

The stability of utility costs in Ivory Coast is also affected by the country's economic performance, with inflation rates influencing the prices of utilities.
