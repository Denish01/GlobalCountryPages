  "content": "The cost of education in Ivory Coast varies depending on the type of institution and level of study, with public primary and secondary education being largely subsidized, while private and international schools can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 4.5% (approximate)\nLiteracy Rate: 49.5% (approximate)\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 10 months\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Ivory Coast is primarily French-based, with French being the language of instruction. The system is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education, with six years of compulsory education. Public education is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private education, with overcrowded classrooms and limited resources being common issues. However, there are also some high-quality private schools available, particularly in the larger cities, which offer a more comprehensive education and better facilities. International schools are also available, particularly in Abidjan, which offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.\n\nThe quality of education in Ivory Coast can vary significantly depending on the institution and location. In general, urban areas tend to have better-equipped schools and more qualified teachers, while rural areas often struggle with limited resources and inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the Ivorian government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve teacher training and curriculum development. For expatriates and international students, there are several options available, including private and international schools, which can provide a high-quality education and a more familiar learning environment.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and overcrowding |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Better facilities and more qualified teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $20-$50 (subsidized) | Limited resources and overcrowding |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,500 | Better facilities and more qualified teachers |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of curricula, including IB and A-levels |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$300 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs and resources |\n| Private University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Better facilities and more qualified faculty |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Félix Houphouët-Boigny University, range of programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability, particularly outside urban areas |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Common for students requiring additional support |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | French and English language courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic supplies, including textbooks and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Required for most schools, including public and private |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats and international students are generally private and international schools, which offer a higher quality of education and more familiar learning environment.\n- Scholarships are available for Ivorian students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, but options are limited for international students.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly available, particularly for higher education, but internet connectivity can be a challenge in some areas.\n- Education quality in Ivory Coast is generally considered to be lower compared to other countries in the region, but there are efforts being made to improve the system.\n- For students requiring additional support, private tutoring is a common option, with many qualified tutors available, particularly in urban areas.\n- When choosing a school, it's essential to research and consider factors such as curriculum, facilities, and teacher qualifications to ensure the best possible education.",
