[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
The Ivory Coast, also known as Côte d'Ivoire, is a sovereign country located in West Africa. It is situated between the latitudes of 4° and 11° north, and longitudes of 2° and 9° west. The country shares its borders with five neighboring countries: Liberia to the southwest, Guinea to the northwest, Mali to the north, Burkina Faso to the northeast, and Ghana to the east. The Ivory Coast also has a coastline along the Gulf of Guinea, which is part of the Atlantic Ocean. This strategic location provides the country with access to the ocean and facilitates trade with other countries.

The Ivory Coast is a significant country in West Africa, with a diverse geography and climate. Its borders with neighboring countries are largely defined by natural features such as rivers and mountains. The country's coastline along the Gulf of Guinea is approximately 515 kilometers long, providing a significant outlet for the country's trade and commerce. The Ivory Coast's location in the tropics means that it has a warm and humid climate, with two main seasons: a dry season and a wet season. The country's geography and climate have a significant impact on its economy, culture, and daily life.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The Ivory Coast has a diverse terrain, with a range of mountains, forests, and coastal plains. The country can be divided into four main geographic regions: the coastal region, the forest region, the mountain region, and the savanna region. The coastal region is a narrow strip of land along the Gulf of Guinea, with a series of lagoons, estuaries, and sandy beaches. The forest region is a dense and humid area, with a variety of tree species and a rich biodiversity. The mountain region is located in the northwest of the country, with a range of mountains, including the **Mont Nimba** range, which is a **UNESCO World Heritage Site**.

The Ivory Coast has a number of significant rivers, including the **Cavally River**, the **Sassandra River**, and the **Bandama River**. These rivers provide water for irrigation, drinking, and hydroelectric power, and are also an important source of fish and other aquatic resources. The country's forests are also home to a wide range of wildlife, including elephants, chimpanzees, and monkeys. The Ivory Coast's terrain and landscape have been shaped by millions of years of geological activity, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and erosion. The country's diverse terrain and landscape support a wide range of ecosystems, including tropical rainforests, mangrove swamps, and savannas.

The Ivory Coast's terrain and landscape have also been influenced by human activity, including deforestation, agriculture, and urbanization. The country's forests have been cleared for agriculture, logging, and other purposes, leading to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. The Ivory Coast's government has implemented a number of initiatives to protect the country's environment, including the creation of national parks and protected areas, and the promotion of sustainable agriculture and forestry practices.
