  "content": "Ivory Coast is generally cheaper than Guinea, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20% in favor of Ivory Coast.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nIvory Coast GDP per Capita (PPP): 4,460\nGuinea GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,390\nIvory Coast Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nGuinea Inflation Rate: 10.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Ivory Coast\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Ivory Coast vs Guinea [/SECTION]\nIvory Coast and Guinea are two neighboring countries in West Africa with distinct economic profiles. Ivory Coast has a relatively stronger economy, driven by its agricultural sector, particularly cocoa and coffee production, as well as a growing services sector. Guinea, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a significant portion of its GDP coming from mining and agriculture. The cost of living in Ivory Coast is generally lower than in Guinea, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being relatively more affordable. This is partly due to Ivory Coast's more developed economy and its larger population, which creates a more competitive market.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Ivory Coast has a more diversified economy, with a strong manufacturing sector and a growing tourism industry, which contributes to its relatively lower prices. Guinea, however, has a more limited economy, with a significant portion of its GDP coming from mineral exports, which can be volatile and subject to fluctuations in global commodity prices. As a result, Guinea's economy is more susceptible to external shocks, which can lead to higher prices and a higher cost of living. Overall, Ivory Coast is generally cheaper than Guinea, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20% in favor of Ivory Coast.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ivory Coast (USD) | Guinea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 320 | 22% more expensive in Guinea |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 180 | 220 | 18% more expensive in Guinea |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 550 | 18% more expensive in Guinea |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ivory Coast (USD) | Guinea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 7 | 29% more expensive in Guinea |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 150 | 200 | 25% more expensive in Guinea |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Guinea |\n| Coffee | 1.50 | 2.50 | 40% more expensive in Guinea |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ivory Coast (USD) | Guinea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Guinea |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 0.70 | 29% more expensive in Guinea |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.00 | 20% more expensive in Guinea |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ivory Coast (USD) | Guinea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 80 | 100 | 20% more expensive in Guinea |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive in Guinea |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Guinea |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Ivory Coast (USD) | Guinea (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 500 | 20% savings in Ivory Coast |\n| Mid-Range | 700 | 900 | 22% savings in Ivory Coast |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,500 | 20% savings in Ivory Coast |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Ivory Coast is cheaper for:**\n  - Accommodation, with prices for apartments and houses being relatively lower\n  - Food, with meal prices and grocery costs being more affordable\n  - Transportation, with lower prices for taxi fares and fuel\n  - Utilities, with lower costs for electricity, water, and internet\n- **Guinea is cheaper for:**\n  - Some imported goods, which may be cheaper due to Guinea's lower import duties\n  - Certain types of clothing and textiles, which may be more affordable in Guinea's markets\n  - Local handicrafts and souvenirs, which may be more affordable in Guinea\n  - Some types of fresh produce, which may be more affordable in Guinea's markets\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIvory Coast is generally the better value for expats, students, and retirees, with its lower cost of living and more developed economy.
