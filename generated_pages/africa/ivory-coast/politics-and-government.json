  "content": "The Ivory Coast is governed as a **unitary presidential republic**, with a system that combines elements of a presidential and parliamentary system, where the President serves as both the head of state and head of government.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President Alassane Ouattara\nHead of Government: President Alassane Ouattara\nLegislature: National Assembly, unicameral with 255 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 143 out of 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 106 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe Ivory Coast's political system is based on the principles of **democracy** and **separation of powers**, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The President, who is directly elected by the people, serves as the head of state and head of government, and is responsible for appointing the government and overseeing the implementation of national policies. The National Assembly, which is composed of 255 members elected by proportional representation, has the power to pass laws and approve the government's budget. The judicial branch, which is headed by the Supreme Court, is responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nThe Ivory Coast's system of government is **unitary**, meaning that power is concentrated in the central government, and the country is divided into 31 regions, each with its own regional council and governor. The government has implemented a number of **decentralization** reforms in recent years, aimed at giving more power to local authorities and promoting regional development. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of **poverty**, **inequality**, and **corruption**, which can undermine the effectiveness of the government and the rule of law.\n\nThe Ivory Coast has a **multiparty system**, with a number of political parties competing for power and representation in the National Assembly. The two main parties are the **Rally of the Republicans** (RDR) and the **Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire** (PDCI), which have historically dominated the country's politics. However, in recent years, other parties have emerged, including the **Ivorian Popular Front** (FPI) and the **Union for Democracy and Peace in Côte d'Ivoire** (UDPCI), which have challenged the dominance of the traditional parties.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Alassane Ouattara | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Government | Prime Minister Patrick Achi | Head of government and responsible for implementing national policies |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker Amadou Soumahoro | Passes laws and approves the government's budget |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Interprets the law and ensures that the government acts in accordance with the Constitution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rally of the Republicans (RDR) | Center-right | Alassane Ouattara | 127 | Dominant party since 2011 |\n| Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire (PDCI) | Center-right | Henri Konan Bédié | 73 | Historically dominant party |\n| Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) | Left-wing | Pascal Affi N'Guessan | 26 | Opposition party |\n| Union for Democracy and Peace in Côte d'Ivoire (UDPCI) | Center-left | Albert Toikeusse Mabri | 12 | Opposition party |\n| Liberty and Democracy for the Republic (LIDER) | Center-left | Mamadou Koulibaly | 7 | Opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The Ivory Coast has a **presidential system**, with the President directly elected by the people for a five-year term.\n- The National Assembly is elected by proportional representation for a five-year term, with the most recent elections held in 2021.\n- The last presidential election was held in 2020, with President Alassane Ouattara winning a third term in office.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled to be held in 2025, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The Ivory Coast has experienced **periods of instability** in recent years, including a civil war in 2010-2011 and ongoing **tensions** between the government and opposition parties.\n- The country faces significant **development challenges**, including poverty, inequality, and corruption, which can undermine the effectiveness of the government and the rule of law.\n- The Ivory Coast has a **mixed record** on human rights, with concerns around freedom of speech, assembly, and the media.\n- The country is also **vulnerable** to regional security threats, including terrorism and instability in neighboring countries.\n- The Ivory Coast has a **low ranking** on the Human Development Index (HDI), which measures factors such as life expectancy, education, and income.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- The Ivory Coast is a member of the **United Nations** (UN) and the **African Union** (AU), and has played an active role in regional and international affairs.\n- The country has **strong ties** with France, its former colonial power, and has also developed relationships with other European countries, including the **European Union** (EU).\n- The Ivory Coast is also a member of the **Economic Community of West African States** (ECOWAS), which aims to promote regional economic integration and cooperation.\n- The country has **diplomatic relations** with a number of countries, including the **United States**, **China**, and **India**, and has sought to diversify its international partnerships in recent years.\n- The Ivory Coast has also been **active** in regional peacekeeping and security initiatives, including the **United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire** (UNOCI) and the **African Union's** peacekeeping mission in the **Sahel region**.",
