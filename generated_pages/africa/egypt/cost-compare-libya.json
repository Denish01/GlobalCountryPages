Egypt has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, while Libya's economy is largely dependent on oil exports. The cost of living in Egypt is generally lower than in Libya, with a significant difference in housing and food prices. Egypt's large population and competitive market have driven down prices, making it an attractive destination for expats and tourists.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Egypt's economy has been growing steadily, with a GDP growth rate of around 5%, while Libya's economy has been affected by political instability and conflict, leading to a decline in GDP growth.
