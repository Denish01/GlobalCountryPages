[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Egypt has several international airports, with Cairo International Airport being the primary entry point for most visitors. The airport is a major hub for EgyptAir, the national carrier, and offers direct flights to many European, African, and Middle Eastern destinations. Other international airports in Egypt include Hurghada, Sharm El-Sheikh, and Luxor, which receive flights from European cities, particularly during the peak tourist season. Overland entry points into Egypt include the border crossings with Libya, Sudan, Israel, and Palestine, although these routes may be subject to restrictions and requirements such as visas and permits.

For those traveling overland, it's essential to research the current entry requirements and any necessary documentation before embarking on your journey. Additionally, some border crossings may be closed or have limited hours of operation, so it's crucial to plan ahead and stay informed. If you're planning to enter Egypt by sea, you can take a ferry from Jordan or Greece to the port city of Nuweiba or Alexandria.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Egypt has an extensive domestic air network, with flights connecting major cities like Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, Aswan, and Hurghada. EgyptAir is the primary domestic carrier, but other airlines like Nile Air and Air Cairo also offer flights to various destinations within the country. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best rates. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and time of booking. It's also worth noting that some domestic flights may have limited schedules, so it's essential to plan your itinerary accordingly.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Egypt's rail network is moderate, with trains connecting major cities along the Nile River, including Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, and Aswan. The rail network is operated by the Egyptian National Railways, and trains range from basic to luxury classes. The most popular route is the overnight train from Cairo to Luxor and Aswan, which offers a comfortable and scenic way to travel. Booking train tickets in advance is recommended, especially for sleeper classes, as they tend to fill up quickly. The booking process can be done online or at train stations, and approximate costs can range from $10 to $100, depending on the class and route.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Egypt has an extensive network of buses and coaches connecting major cities and towns, operated by companies like Go Bus and Blue Bus. The quality of buses varies, but most are air-conditioned and comfortable. Routes and schedules can be found online or at bus stations, and approximate costs can range from $5 to $20, depending on the route and class. While buses are a more affordable option than trains or flights, they may not always be the most convenient or comfortable choice, especially for longer journeys.
