The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Cairo having a comprehensive and relatively affordable system, while other cities may have more limited options. Most people in Egypt get around using public transportation, with buses and minivans being the most popular modes of transport, especially for short distances.\n\nIn larger cities, the metro system is a convenient and efficient way to get around, with multiple lines and frequent services. However, outside of major cities, transportation options may be more limited, and taxis or ride-hailing services may be the best option. Additionally, many Egyptians own their own vehicles, and driving is a common mode of transportation, especially for longer distances. However, traffic in major cities can be chaotic, and parking can be a challenge, so public transportation is often the preferred option.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage in smaller cities |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.20-$0.50 | $15-$30 | Available in Cairo and Alexandria |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Routes vary, but commonly used for short distances |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$5.00 | $20-$50 | Limited routes, but available for longer distances |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.20-$0.50 | $5-$10 | Be prepared to negotiate |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00-$5.00 | $0.20-$0.50 | $5-$15 | Uber and Careem available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.60-$0.80 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.50-$0.70 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$100 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$5 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, but may apply to certain highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | Depending on route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$150 | Typical route, such as Cairo to Alexandria |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, but available for longer distances |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or minivans for short distances.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Careem for convenience and to avoid negotiating taxi fares.\n- Be prepared to negotiate taxi fares, as meters may not always be used.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing services to ensure safety.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for frequent travel on public transportation.\n- Download transportation apps like Moovit or Transit to help navigate public transportation systems in Egypt.",
