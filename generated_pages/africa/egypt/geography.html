        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Egypt is located in the northeastern part of Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the east. It is situated in a strategic position, connecting Africa to Asia through the Suez Canal, a vital shipping route. To the west, Egypt shares a border with Libya, while to the south, it borders Sudan. The country also shares borders with Israel and Palestine to the northeast, with the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula being key areas of contact. The country's unique geography, with the Nile River flowing through it, has made it an important center of trade and culture for thousands of years.</p>
        <p>The country's borders are defined by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries. The Mediterranean coastline to the north is approximately 1,050 km long, while the Red Sea coastline to the east is about 1,400 km long. The Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, is a vital shipping route that runs through the country. The country's borders with its neighboring countries are largely defined by international agreements and treaties, with some areas still being disputed. The Sinai Peninsula, which is part of Egypt, is a strategic location that connects Africa to Asia and is home to several important ports and trade routes.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Egypt's terrain is characterized by a combination of deserts, mountains, and fertile valleys. The <strong>Nile River</strong>, which flows through the country, is the lifeblood of Egypt and has supported agriculture and human settlement for thousands of years. The Nile Valley, which is the fertile area surrounding the river, is home to most of Egypt's population and is the country's most productive agricultural region. The valley is surrounded by deserts, including the <strong>Western Desert</strong> to the west and the <strong>Eastern Desert</strong> to the east. These deserts are home to several important oases, including the <strong>Siwa Oasis</strong>, which is a key center of trade and culture.</p>
        <p>The country's mountainous regions are located in the southern part of the country, where the <strong>Nubian Mountains</strong> meet the <strong>Red Sea Hills</strong>. The highest point in Egypt, <strong>Mount Catherine</strong>, is located in this region and is a popular destination for hikers and adventure seekers. The country's coastline, which borders the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, is home to several important ports and tourist destinations, including <strong>Alexandria</strong> and <strong>Sharm el-Sheikh</strong>. The <strong>Suez Canal</strong>, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, is a vital shipping route that runs through the country and is an important part of Egypt's economy.</p>
        <p>The country's deserts, which cover most of its land area, are home to several important natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and minerals. The <strong>Western Desert</strong>, which is the largest desert in Egypt, is home to several important oases, including the <strong>Siwa Oasis</strong> and the <strong>Bahariya Oasis</strong>. These oases are key centers of trade and culture and are home to several important archaeological sites, including the <strong>Temple of Amun</strong> in Siwa. The <strong>Eastern Desert</strong>, which is located to the east of the Nile Valley, is home to several important mining operations, including gold and copper mines.</p>
