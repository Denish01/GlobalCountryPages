In terms of cost of living, Egypt is generally considered to be the more affordable option, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. This is partly due to the fact that Egypt has a larger population and a more developed economy, which can lead to greater competition and lower prices. Morocco, on the other hand, has a more tourist-oriented economy, which can drive up prices in popular areas.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Egypt has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on industry and manufacturing, while Morocco has a more service-based economy, with a greater emphasis on tourism and trade. This can lead to differences in the cost of living, with Egypt tend to be more affordable for everyday expenses, while Morocco may be more expensive for luxury items and tourist activities.
