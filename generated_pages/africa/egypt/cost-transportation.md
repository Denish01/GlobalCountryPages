[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Egypt has a well-developed transportation network, with a range of options available to get around, including buses, taxis, ride-hailing services, and metro lines in major cities like Cairo and Alexandria. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Cairo having a comprehensive and relatively affordable system, while other cities may have more limited options. Most people in Egypt get around using public transportation, with buses and minivans being the most popular modes of transport, especially for short distances.

In larger cities, the metro system is a convenient and efficient way to get around, with multiple lines and frequent services. However, outside of major cities, transportation options may be more limited, and taxis or ride-hailing services may be the best option. Additionally, many Egyptians own their own vehicles, and driving is a common mode of transportation, especially for longer distances. However, traffic in major cities can be chaotic, and parking can be a challenge, so public transportation is often the preferred option.
