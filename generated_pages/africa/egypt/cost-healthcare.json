The public healthcare system is generally overcrowded and understaffed, but it provides affordable care to locals. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers better quality care but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private care. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals often having to navigate a complex and bureaucratic process to access care, while foreigners can usually access private care more easily.\n\nThe need for insurance in Egypt is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners and those seeking private care. The cost of healthcare in Egypt can be high, especially for non-emergency procedures, and having insurance can help to mitigate these costs. There are several types of insurance available, including basic local insurance, comprehensive private insurance, and international/expat insurance. Each type of insurance has its own set of benefits and drawbacks, and the cost can vary greatly depending on the provider and the level of coverage.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,500 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, and more |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including Egypt, with high-level benefits |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-$10 per prescription\n- **Prescription rules** vary, but most medications require a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good, with many pharmacies located throughout major cities\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available, but may require a prescription for certain types\n- The cost of **specialized medications** can be high, ranging from $50-$100 per prescription\n- It is recommended to always check the **expiration date** and **authenticity** of medications before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to know what to do and where to go.
