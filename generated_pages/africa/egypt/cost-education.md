[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Egypt is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector offering free or subsidized education to all citizens. However, the quality of public education can vary greatly depending on the location and resources available, with some schools lacking basic facilities and qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools and international institutions offer higher-quality education, often with English as the language of instruction, but at a significantly higher cost. Compulsory education in Egypt lasts for 12 years, starting from the age of 6, and is divided into primary, preparatory, and secondary stages. International schools are also available, particularly in major cities like Cairo and Alexandria, offering a range of curricula including British, American, and French.

The language of instruction in public schools is Arabic, while private schools and international institutions often use English or other languages as the primary language of instruction. This can create a significant gap in the quality of education between public and private schools, with private schools often having better facilities, more qualified teachers, and greater access to resources. Despite these challenges, the Egyptian government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve teacher training and curriculum development.
