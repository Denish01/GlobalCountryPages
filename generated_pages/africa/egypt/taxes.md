[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Egypt has a **territorial tax system**, which means that individuals and companies are taxed on their income earned within Egypt, regardless of their residence status. However, Egyptian residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with certain exemptions and deductions available. The residency rules for tax purposes in Egypt are based on the **183-day rule**, which states that an individual is considered a resident if they spend more than 183 days in Egypt in a calendar year.

The tax system in Egypt is administered by the **Egyptian Tax Authority**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax services to individuals and companies. The tax authority has implemented various measures to improve tax compliance and reduce tax evasion, including the introduction of electronic tax filing and payment systems. Egypt has also signed **double taxation treaties** with many countries to avoid taxing the same income twice and to provide relief to taxpayers.
