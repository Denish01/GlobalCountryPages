  "content": "Healthcare in Egypt is a mixed system that provides both public and private services, with varying levels of quality and accessibility depending on the location and type of care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 123\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nEgypt's healthcare system is a complex network of public and private providers, with the Ministry of Health and Population overseeing the overall healthcare strategy. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with a wide range of facilities, from small clinics to large hospitals. However, the quality of care can vary significantly, with public hospitals often facing challenges such as overcrowding, outdated equipment, and shortages of medical supplies. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics tend to offer higher-quality care, with more modern facilities and better-trained staff, but at a significantly higher cost. Urban areas, such as Cairo and Alexandria, have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often struggle with limited resources and a shortage of medical professionals.\n\nThe Egyptian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a universal health insurance scheme, which aims to provide comprehensive coverage to all citizens. However, the scheme is still in its early stages, and many Egyptians continue to rely on out-of-pocket payments or private insurance to access quality healthcare. Additionally, the country faces significant challenges in terms of healthcare infrastructure, with a shortage of specialized facilities, such as cancer treatment centers and cardiac care units.\n\nDespite these challenges, Egypt has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system, with a growing number of private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care. The country has also become a popular destination for medical tourism, with many foreigners traveling to Egypt for procedures such as cosmetic surgery, dental care, and fertility treatment. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the facility and the location, and patients should carefully research and evaluate their options before seeking medical care in Egypt.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cleopatra Hospital | Cairo | Private | Cardiology, Oncology, Neurosurgery | Yes |\n| Dar Al Fouad Hospital | Cairo | Private | Cardiology, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Orthopedic Surgery | Yes |\n| As-Salam International Hospital | Cairo | Private | General Surgery, Urology, Nephrology | Yes |\n| Alexandria University Hospital | Alexandria | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics | Limited |\n| Magdi Yacoub Heart Foundation | Cairo | Private | Cardiology, Cardiothoracic Surgery | Yes |\n| Nile Badrawi Hospital | Cairo | Private | General Surgery, Orthopedic Surgery, Urology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Expats and tourists are recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in Egypt, as the public healthcare system can be unpredictable and may not provide the same level of care as private facilities.\n- Local insurance options are available, but may not provide comprehensive coverage, and may have limited networks of providers.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n- The cost of health insurance in Egypt can vary significantly, depending on the provider, the level of coverage, and the individual's age and health status.\n- Some popular health insurance providers in Egypt include **Allianz**, **AXA**, and **Bupa**.\n- It is essential to carefully review and compare different insurance options before making a decision, to ensure that you have adequate coverage and can access quality healthcare when needed.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Pharmacies are widespread in Egypt, with many locations in urban areas, and a more limited presence in rural areas.\n- Many medications are available over-the-counter, without a prescription, but some may require a prescription from a licensed physician.\n- **Prescription medications** can be more difficult to obtain, and may require a visit to a private clinic or hospital.\n- Common brands of medications are often available, but may be more expensive than generic alternatives.\n- The cost of medications in Egypt can vary significantly, depending on the type of medication, the brand, and the location.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **Typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Egypt, as these diseases are prevalent in the country.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is also recommended, as the disease is common in Egypt, and can be transmitted through animal bites.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Egypt, particularly in the southern regions, and travelers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- **Schistosomiasis** is a water-borne disease that can be contracted through swimming or wading in contaminated water, and travelers should avoid swimming in freshwater areas.\n- **Food-borne illnesses** are common in Egypt, and travelers should take precautions to avoid eating undercooked or raw foods, and to drink only bottled or filtered water.\n- **Heat stroke** and **dehydration** are significant risks in Egypt's hot desert climate, and travelers should take precautions to stay hydrated and avoid exposure to the sun.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Egypt has become a popular destination for medical tourism, with many foreigners traveling to the country for procedures such as **cosmetic surgery**, **dental care**, and **fertility treatment**.\n- The country has a number of **accredited hospitals** and clinics that offer high-quality care at a lower cost than in many Western countries.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with some procedures costing 50-70% less than in the US or Europe.\n- Popular medical tourism destinations in Egypt include Cairo, Alexandria, and Sharm El-Sheikh.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a medical emergency, travelers should call the **emergency number** (123) or go to the nearest hospital.\n- **Ambulance services** are available in major cities, but may not be reliable in rural areas.\n- Travelers should have a **basic first aid kit** with them, and know how to use the items in the kit.\n- In the event of a serious medical emergency, travelers may need to be **evacuated** to a hospital in a major city, or to a hospital in their home country.\n- Travelers should have a **plan in place** for emergency medical situations, including a list of emergency contact numbers and a plan for evacuation if necessary.",
