[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Egypt's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally overcrowded and understaffed, but it provides affordable care to locals. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers better quality care but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private care. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals often having to navigate a complex and bureaucratic process to access care, while foreigners can usually access private care more easily.

The need for insurance in Egypt is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners and those seeking private care. The cost of healthcare in Egypt can be high, especially for non-emergency procedures, and having insurance can help to mitigate these costs. There are several types of insurance available, including basic local insurance, comprehensive private insurance, and international/expat insurance. Each type of insurance has its own set of benefits and drawbacks, and the cost can vary greatly depending on the provider and the level of coverage.
