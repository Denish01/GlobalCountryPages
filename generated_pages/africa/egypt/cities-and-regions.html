        <h2>How Egypt Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Egypt is divided into 27 governorates, which are the primary administrative divisions of the country. These governorates are further divided into smaller districts and villages. The governorates are responsible for providing various public services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, to their respective populations. The division of Egypt into governorates allows for more efficient management and distribution of resources, as well as a more localized approach to addressing regional needs and concerns.</p>
        <p>The administrative structure of Egypt is overseen by the Ministry of Local Development, which is responsible for coordinating the activities of the governorates and ensuring that they are working towards the country's overall development goals. The governorates are also represented in the national government, with each governorate having a number of seats in the Egyptian parliament. This allows for the voices and concerns of different regions to be heard at the national level.</p>
