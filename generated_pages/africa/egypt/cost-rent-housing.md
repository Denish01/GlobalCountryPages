[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Egypt is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms in Egypt are one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it's essential to have a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the lease. Compared to regional neighbors, Egypt's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to relocate to the region. However, the high inflation rate of 28.3% can impact the cost of living, including housing prices.

The Egyptian government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage and provide affordable housing options for low-income families. These initiatives include subsidized housing programs and partnerships with private developers to build affordable housing units. Additionally, the government has introduced regulations to control rent increases and protect tenants' rights. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Egypt still faces challenges, including a shortage of affordable housing options and a high demand for housing in urban areas.
