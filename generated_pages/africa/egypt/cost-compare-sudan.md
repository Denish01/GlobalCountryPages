[SECTION] Overview: Egypt vs Sudan [/SECTION]
Egypt and Sudan are two neighboring countries in northeastern Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Egypt has a relatively large and diversified economy, with a strong service sector and a significant industrial base, which contributes to its higher GDP per capita. In contrast, Sudan has a smaller and more fragile economy, with a high inflation rate and a heavy reliance on agriculture and oil exports. As a result, the cost of living in Sudan is generally higher than in Egypt, particularly when it comes to food, transportation, and utilities.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. Egypt has a large and growing population, with a relatively high level of urbanization, which puts pressure on housing and transportation costs. However, the country's strong economy and relatively stable political environment have also attracted significant foreign investment, which has helped to keep prices in check. In Sudan, the economic situation is more challenging, with a smaller and more isolated economy, which has been affected by international sanctions and a lack of foreign investment. As a result, the cost of living in Sudan is generally higher, particularly for expatriates and foreigners.
