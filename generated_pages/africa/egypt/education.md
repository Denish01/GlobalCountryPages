[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Egypt is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **basic education**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 14 and lasts for six years. Secondary education, also known as **general secondary education**, is also compulsory and lasts for three years. Tertiary education, also known as **higher education**, is provided by universities and other institutions, and offers a range of undergraduate and graduate programs. The quality of education in Egypt varies, with public schools often struggling with overcrowding and limited resources, while private schools and universities tend to offer higher quality education.

The public education system in Egypt is free, but it is often criticized for being overly focused on **rote memorization** and lacking in critical thinking skills. On the other hand, private schools and universities in Egypt offer a more **Western-style education**, with a focus on critical thinking, problem-solving, and independent learning. However, these institutions are often expensive and out of reach for many Egyptians. The Egyptian government has implemented various reforms in recent years to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods.

Despite these efforts, the education system in Egypt still faces many challenges, including overcrowding, limited resources, and a lack of qualified teachers. Additionally, the system is often criticized for being overly focused on **standardized testing**, which can lead to a narrow focus on **test preparation** rather than broader learning goals. However, there are also many success stories in Egyptian education, with many students going on to achieve great things in a variety of fields, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (**STEM**).
