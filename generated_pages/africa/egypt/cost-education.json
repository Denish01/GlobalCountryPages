  "content": "The cost of education in Egypt varies widely, with public schools offering free or subsidized education, while private schools and international institutions can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 3.8% (2020 est.)\nLiteracy Rate: 71%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 10 months\nCurrency: EGP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Egypt is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector offering free or subsidized education to all citizens. However, the quality of public education can vary greatly depending on the location and resources available, with some schools lacking basic facilities and qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools and international institutions offer higher-quality education, often with English as the language of instruction, but at a significantly higher cost. Compulsory education in Egypt lasts for 12 years, starting from the age of 6, and is divided into primary, preparatory, and secondary stages. International schools are also available, particularly in major cities like Cairo and Alexandria, offering a range of curricula including British, American, and French.\n\nThe language of instruction in public schools is Arabic, while private schools and international institutions often use English or other languages as the primary language of instruction. This can create a significant gap in the quality of education between public and private schools, with private schools often having better facilities, more qualified teachers, and greater access to resources. Despite these challenges, the Egyptian government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve teacher training and curriculum development.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and facilities |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range depends on school tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and facilities |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range depends on school tier and location |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | Offers British, American, or French curriculum |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited seats available for international students |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Offers a range of programs, including business and engineering |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000-$10,000 | $8,000-$15,000 | American University in Cairo, offers a range of programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Depends on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Depends on subject and tutor qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | Offers Arabic, English, and other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Depends on school and grade level |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most private and public schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The American University in Cairo is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Egypt, offering a range of programs in English.\n- Scholarships are available for local and international students, particularly for those studying at public universities.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Egypt, with many universities offering online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in Egypt is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, such as the UAE and Qatar.\n- Expats often prefer to send their children to international schools, which offer a more familiar curriculum and higher quality education.\n- **Private tutoring** is a common practice in Egypt, particularly for students preparing for exams or seeking to improve their grades.",
