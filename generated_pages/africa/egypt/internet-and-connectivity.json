However, the urban-rural divide is still evident, with slower speeds and less reliable connections in rural areas. The average internet speed in Egypt is around 10 Mbps download, which is sufficient for general browsing, email, and social media, but may not be enough for heavy streaming or online gaming. In general, the internet quality in Egypt is good enough for most tourists and business travelers, but may not meet the expectations of remote workers or digital nomads who require fast and reliable connections.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Egypt can be affected by various factors, including power outages, network congestion, and maintenance. However, the main carriers in Egypt, such as Vodafone, Orange, and Etisalat, have made significant investments in their infrastructure to improve the quality and reliability of their services. Additionally, the Egyptian government has launched several initiatives to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the development of a national broadband network and the establishment of data centers to support the growth of the digital economy.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Egypt is relatively easy, with many mobile carriers offering tourist-friendly plans and a wide range of retailers selling SIM cards. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide your passport and a copy of your visa, if required. The cost of a SIM card can vary depending on the carrier and the plan you choose, but you can expect to pay around 10 USD for a tourist SIM with a limited data plan.
