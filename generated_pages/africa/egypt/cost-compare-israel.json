  "content": "Egypt is generally cheaper than Israel, with a cost of living that is approximately 30-40% lower, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and travelers on a budget.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEgypt GDP per Capita (PPP): 12,574\nIsrael GDP per Capita (PPP): 43,688\nEgypt Inflation Rate: 5.6%\nIsrael Inflation Rate: 1.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Egypt\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Egypt vs Israel [/SECTION]\nEgypt and Israel are two neighboring countries with distinct economies and cost of living profiles. Egypt, with its large population and growing economy, has a relatively low cost of living, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats. Israel, on the other hand, has a high-tech economy and a strong currency, which contributes to its higher cost of living. The overall cost of living in Egypt is significantly lower than in Israel, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being substantially cheaper.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Egypt's economy is driven by agriculture, industry, and services, while Israel's economy is driven by technology, finance, and tourism. The difference in economic structures and the value of their currencies also affect the cost of living in both countries. For example, the Egyptian pound is relatively weak compared to the Israeli shekel, making imports and foreign goods more expensive in Egypt. However, the low cost of living in Egypt makes it an attractive option for those looking to stretch their budget.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Egypt (USD) | Israel (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 1,200 | 83% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 900 | 83% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 2,500 | 84% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Egypt (USD) | Israel (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 15 | 67% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 300 | 67% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 3 | 67% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Egypt (USD) | Israel (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 70 | 86% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 2 | 75% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.6 | 1.5 | 60% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Egypt (USD) | Israel (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 150 | 67% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 50 | 60% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 30 | 67% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Egypt (USD) | Israel (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 1,500 | 67% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,000 | 3,000 | 67% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 5,000 | 60% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Egypt is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing\n- Food and dining\n- Transportation\n- Utilities and internet\n- **Israel is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and luxury goods\n- International travel and tourism\n- High-tech products and services\n- Medical care and healthcare services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nEgypt offers better value for expats, students, and travelers on a budget, with a significantly lower cost of living and a wide range of affordable options for accommodation, food, and transportation.

Ultimately, the choice between Egypt and Israel depends on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences. Both countries have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and it is essential to research and compare the costs and benefits of each destination before making a decision.",
