[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Egypt: October to February. Peak season: December to January. Budget season: March to May and September to November. Avoid: June to August due to the extremely hot weather and July to September for the crowded tourist season. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Egypt has a **desert climate**, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the **Mediterranean coastal region**, which has a milder climate, and the **Nile Valley and Desert regions**, which are much hotter and drier. The dry season, which lasts from September to May, is the best time to visit Egypt, as the weather is generally dry and sunny. The wet season, which occurs from June to August, is very hot and humid, making it less comfortable for tourists.

The seasons in Egypt have a significant impact on travel, with the peak tourist season coinciding with the winter months. During this time, prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher, and popular attractions can be very crowded. In contrast, the off-season, which occurs during the summer months, is much quieter, but the heat can be overwhelming, making it difficult to explore the country's outdoor attractions.

In addition to the climate, the **Nile River** plays a crucial role in shaping Egypt's seasons. The annual flooding of the Nile, which occurs in July and August, was once a significant event in the country's agricultural calendar. Although the construction of the **Aswan Dam** has controlled the flooding, the event is still celebrated during the **Sham el-Nessim** festival, which takes place in March or April.
