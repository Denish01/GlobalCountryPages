[SECTION] Overview: Egypt vs Israel [/SECTION]
Egypt and Israel are two neighboring countries with distinct economies and cost of living profiles. Egypt, with its large population and growing economy, has a relatively low cost of living, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats. Israel, on the other hand, has a high-tech economy and a strong currency, which contributes to its higher cost of living. The overall cost of living in Egypt is significantly lower than in Israel, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being substantially cheaper.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Egypt's economy is driven by agriculture, industry, and services, while Israel's economy is driven by technology, finance, and tourism. The difference in economic structures and the value of their currencies also affect the cost of living in both countries. For example, the Egyptian pound is relatively weak compared to the Israeli shekel, making imports and foreign goods more expensive in Egypt. However, the low cost of living in Egypt makes it an attractive option for those looking to stretch their budget.
