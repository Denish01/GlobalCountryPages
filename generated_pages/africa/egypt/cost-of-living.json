[/SECTION]\nEgypt is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is lower than many other countries in the world. Compared to its neighbors, Egypt is relatively cheap, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being lower than in countries such as Israel or Libya. However, prices in Egypt can vary greatly depending on the location, with cities like Cairo and Alexandria tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.

Additionally, the country's economy has been growing in recent years, which has led to an increase in tourism and investment. This has resulted in a wider range of accommodation and dining options, making it easier for visitors to find something that suits their budget.
