Home cooking is also common, with many Egyptians opting to prepare meals at home using fresh ingredients from local markets.\n\nThe cost of food in Egypt can fluctuate depending on the season, with prices tend to be higher during peak tourist season and lower during the off-season. Additionally, the type of cuisine and dining options can greatly impact the cost, with traditional Egyptian restaurants and street food stalls generally being more affordable than international restaurants and fine dining establishments. Overall, Egypt offers a unique and affordable culinary experience, with a wide range of options to suit all budgets and tastes.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 25 EGP | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 10 EGP | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 20 EGP | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 17 EGP | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 60 EGP | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 100 EGP | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.00 | 35 EGP | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 17 EGP | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 14 EGP | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 10 EGP | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 70 EGP | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50 | 10 EGP | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like koshari, falafel) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$6 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Egyptians often have the option to choose between supermarkets and local markets.

The prices at local markets tend to be lower, with a difference of around 10-20% compared to supermarkets. However, the quality and variety of products may vary, and bargaining is often expected at local markets.\n\nIn general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, spices, and other staples at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for imported goods, dairy products, and other specialty items. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to haggle and negotiate prices, as this is a common practice in Egyptian culture. Additionally, be sure to check the quality and freshness of the products before making a purchase, and don't be afraid to walk away if the price is not right.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Egypt is to try street food or local eateries, which offer a wide range of traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- Local staples like **ful medames** (stewed fava beans), **ta'ameya** (Egyptian falafel), and **koshari** (a vegetarian dish made with pasta, lentils, and tomato sauce) are delicious and affordable options.\n- **Shawarma** (a popular street food made with grilled meat and served in a pita bread) is another cheap and tasty option.\n- When shopping for groceries, consider buying in bulk and opting for local products, which tend to be cheaper than imported goods.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, which can be expensive due to high tariffs and taxes.\n- Don't be afraid to try new foods and drinks, like **karkade** (a traditional Egyptian tea made with hibiscus flowers) or **sahlab** (a sweet, milky drink made with orchid root).",
