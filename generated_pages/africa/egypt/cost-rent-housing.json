Typical lease terms in Egypt are one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it's essential to have a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the lease. Compared to regional neighbors, Egypt's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to relocate to the region. However, the high inflation rate of 28.3% can impact the cost of living, including housing prices.\n\nThe Egyptian government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage and provide affordable housing options for low-income families. These initiatives include subsidized housing programs and partnerships with private developers to build affordable housing units. Additionally, the government has introduced regulations to control rent increases and protect tenants' rights. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Egypt still faces challenges, including a shortage of affordable housing options and a high demand for housing in urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | small, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$500 | $150-$350 | medium size, standard amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $350-$700 | $250-$550 | large size, additional amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$1,200 | $350-$900 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, medium demand |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | limited amenities, low demand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Downtown Cairo**: $300-$600 USD per month, a vibrant and cosmopolitan area with easy access to amenities and services\n- **Garden City**: $250-$500 USD per month, a leafy and upscale neighborhood with a mix of modern and historic buildings\n- **Heliopolis**: $200-$400 USD per month, a bustling and diverse area with a range of amenities and services\n- **Maadi**: $250-$500 USD per month, a suburban area with a mix of modern and traditional housing options\n- **Zamalek**: $300-$600 USD per month, an upscale and trendy neighborhood with a range of amenities and services\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Egypt [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable apartment\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease before signing a contract\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that you are dealing with a legitimate landlord or agent\n- Utilities such as electricity and water are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are available, but unfurnished apartments are more common, so be prepared to purchase furniture and appliances if necessary\n- [CALLOUT] Be sure to inspect the property thoroughly before signing a lease to avoid any potential issues or disputes. \n[RATING] Affordability: 4/5",
