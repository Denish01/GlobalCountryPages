# Egypt Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Egypt before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Egypt has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and prior visa requirements for different nationalities. Citizens of around 10 countries, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, can enter Egypt visa-free for a limited period. Other nationalities may be eligible for a visa on arrival or may need to obtain a prior visa from an Egyptian embassy or consulate.

The Egyptian government has introduced an electronic visa system to simplify the process for tourists and business travelers. The e-visa is available for citizens of over 40 countries and can be obtained online prior to travel. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and travelers should always check the latest information before planning their trip to Egypt.
