[SECTION] How Expensive Is Egypt? [/SECTION]
Egypt is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is lower than many other countries in the world. Compared to its neighbors, Egypt is relatively cheap, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being lower than in countries such as Israel or Libya. However, prices in Egypt can vary greatly depending on the location, with cities like Cairo and Alexandria tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Overall, Egypt offers a great value for money, with a rich history, culture, and natural beauty to explore.

Egypt's affordability is due in part to its large population and competitive markets, which help to keep prices low.
