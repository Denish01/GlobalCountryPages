  "content": "Egypt is generally cheaper than Sudan, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEgypt GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,350\nSudan GDP per Capita (PPP): 4,580\nEgypt Inflation Rate: 5.6%\nSudan Inflation Rate: 50.4%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Egypt\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Egypt vs Sudan [/SECTION]\nEgypt and Sudan are two neighboring countries in northeastern Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Egypt has a relatively large and diversified economy, with a strong service sector and a significant industrial base, which contributes to its higher GDP per capita. In contrast, Sudan has a smaller and more fragile economy, with a high inflation rate and a heavy reliance on agriculture and oil exports. As a result, the cost of living in Sudan is generally higher than in Egypt, particularly when it comes to food, transportation, and utilities.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. Egypt has a large and growing population, with a relatively high level of urbanization, which puts pressure on housing and transportation costs. However, the country's strong economy and relatively stable political environment have also attracted significant foreign investment, which has helped to keep prices in check. In Sudan, the economic situation is more challenging, with a smaller and more isolated economy, which has been affected by international sanctions and a lack of foreign investment. As a result, the cost of living in Sudan is generally higher, particularly for expatriates and foreigners.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Egypt (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% more expensive in Sudan |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% more expensive in Sudan |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% more expensive in Sudan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Egypt (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% more expensive in Sudan |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% more expensive in Sudan |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 5 | 60% more expensive in Sudan |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% more expensive in Sudan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Egypt (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% more expensive in Sudan |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% more expensive in Sudan |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.5 | 1.5 | 67% more expensive in Sudan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Egypt (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 100 | 50% more expensive in Sudan |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 50 | 60% more expensive in Sudan |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% more expensive in Sudan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Egypt (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 800 | 37% cheaper in Egypt |\n| Mid-Range | 1000 | 1500 | 33% cheaper in Egypt |\n| Comfortable | 2000 | 3000 | 33% cheaper in Egypt |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Egypt is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices that are 30-40% lower than in Sudan\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices that are 50-60% lower than in Sudan\n  - Transportation, with fuel and taxi prices that are 50-67% lower than in Sudan\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices that are 50-60% lower than in Sudan\n- **Sudan is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain types of groceries, such as fresh produce and meat, which can be 10-20% cheaper than in Egypt\n  - Some types of entertainment, such as cinema tickets and museum entrance fees, which can be 20-30% cheaper than in Egypt\n  - Certain types of clothing and textiles, which can be 10-20% cheaper than in Egypt\n  - Traditional handicrafts and souvenirs, which can be 20-30% cheaper than in Egypt\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nOverall, Egypt offers a more affordable cost of living than Sudan, with prices that are 20-30% lower across a range of categories. This makes Egypt a more attractive option for expatriates, students, and retirees who are looking for a low-cost destination with a rich cultural heritage and a relatively high standard of living. However, Sudan has its own unique advantages, including a more relaxed pace of life and a stronger sense of community, which can make it an attractive option for those who value these aspects of life. Ultimately, the choice between Egypt and Sudan will depend on individual preferences and priorities, as well as the specific lifestyle and budget of each person.",
