Eswatini has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Mbabane and Manzini having more frequent and reliable services. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation network means that many people rely on private vehicles or **ride-hailing apps** to get around. The country's road network is generally in good condition, but traffic congestion can be a problem in urban areas.

The main transportation modes in Eswatini are **minibuses**, **shared taxis**, and **private vehicles**. Minibuses and shared taxis are the most affordable options, but they can be crowded and uncomfortable. Private vehicles are more convenient, but they can be expensive to maintain and fuel.
