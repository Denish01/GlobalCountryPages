The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Mbabane and Manzini having more frequent and reliable services. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation network means that many people rely on private vehicles or **ride-hailing apps** to get around. The country's road network is generally in good condition, but traffic congestion can be a problem in urban areas.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Eswatini are **minibuses**, **shared taxis**, and **private vehicles**. Minibuses and shared taxis are the most affordable options, but they can be crowded and uncomfortable. Private vehicles are more convenient, but they can be expensive to maintain and fuel. The government has been working to improve the public transportation system, but there is still a long way to go. Despite the challenges, Eswatini's transportation system is relatively affordable, with the cost of fuel and transportation services comparable to other countries in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Limited coverage, frequent services in Mbabane and Manzini |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Frequent services, routes cover most urban areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5.00 | $1.00 | $10-$20 | Available in Mbabane and Manzini |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Bolt and Uber available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To Mbabane or Manzini city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, including fuel and insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Limited parking options in urban areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2.00-$5.00 | Limited toll roads, mostly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Frequent services, comfortable buses |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes, mostly to Johannesburg or Durban |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use **minibuses** and **shared taxis** for affordable and frequent services in urban areas\n- Download **ride-hailing apps** like Bolt and Uber for convenient and affordable transportation\n- Negotiate **taxi fares** before starting your journey to avoid overcharging\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** in urban areas and plan your journey accordingly\n- Consider **car rental** for long-distance travel or for exploring rural areas\n- Always wear a **seatbelt** and follow local **traffic rules** to ensure your safety on the road\nNote: Prices may vary depending on the city, time of day, and other factors, so it's always a good idea to research and compare prices before making a decision.",
