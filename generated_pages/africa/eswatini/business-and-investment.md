[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Eswatini has a relatively favorable business environment, with a government that is generally supportive of foreign investment. The country has a number of investment promotion agencies, including the Eswatini Investment Promotion Authority, which provides a range of services to potential investors, including information on investment opportunities, help with setting up a business, and support with obtaining necessary permits and licenses. However, the country's bureaucracy can be slow and cumbersome, and corruption is a significant problem, with Eswatini ranking 117 out of 180 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The government has taken steps to address these issues, including the introduction of a new investment code and the establishment of a number of special economic zones.

The business environment in Eswatini is also influenced by the country's location, with its proximity to South Africa and Mozambique making it an attractive location for companies looking to export to these markets. The country is also a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which provides access to a larger market.

Despite these advantages, Eswatini's business environment is not without its challenges, including a relatively high level of unemployment and a shortage of skilled workers. The country is also heavily reliant on a few key sectors, including agriculture and manufacturing, which can make it vulnerable to external shocks.
