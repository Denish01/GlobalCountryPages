  "content": "Doing business in Eswatini can be relatively straightforward, with the country offering a range of investment opportunities, particularly in the agricultural, manufacturing, and tourism sectors, although it also presents some challenges, including a relatively high level of bureaucracy and corruption.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEase of Doing Business: 121 out of 190 countries (World Bank ranking)\nCorporate Tax Rate: 27.5%\nFDI Inflow: $114 million annual\nSpecial Economic Zones: Yes, 3\nKey Industries: Agriculture, Manufacturing, Tourism\nCurrency Stability: Moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]\nEswatini has a relatively favorable business environment, with a government that is generally supportive of foreign investment. The country has a number of investment promotion agencies, including the Eswatini Investment Promotion Authority, which provides a range of services to potential investors, including information on investment opportunities, help with setting up a business, and support with obtaining necessary permits and licenses. However, the country's bureaucracy can be slow and cumbersome, and corruption is a significant problem, with Eswatini ranking 117 out of 180 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The government has taken steps to address these issues, including the introduction of a new investment code and the establishment of a number of special economic zones.\n\nThe business environment in Eswatini is also influenced by the country's location, with its proximity to South Africa and Mozambique making it an attractive location for companies looking to export to these markets.
