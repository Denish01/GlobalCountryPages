The demand for rental properties is driven by the growing expat community, students, and young professionals. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by the Rent Control Act, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, South Africa and Mozambique, Eswatini's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center. However, the cost of living in Eswatini is still lower than in many other countries, making it an attractive option for expats and retirees.\n\nThe housing market in Eswatini is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the GDP per capita (PPP) of $11,799 indicating a relatively high standard of living. The inflation rate of 2.6% and the out-of-pocket health spend of 11.0% also impact the housing market, as people may allocate a larger portion of their budget to healthcare and other essential expenses. As a result, the demand for affordable housing options is increasing, particularly in the suburbs and rural areas. The government's education spend of 6.0% of GDP also contributes to the growth of the middle class, which in turn drives the demand for better housing options.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $200-$400 | modern appliances, secure parking |\n| 2 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $300-$600 | family size, spacious living area |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $450-$900 | luxurious finishes, garden or yard |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,500 | residential areas, tree-lined streets |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | scenic views, agricultural land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Mbabane Central: $300-$600 USD per month, vibrant nightlife and shopping\n- Ezulwini Valley: $250-$500 USD per month, scenic views and outdoor activities\n- Manzini: $200-$400 USD per month, cultural attractions and local markets\n- Matsapha: $150-$300 USD per month, industrial area with affordable housing\n- Nhlangano: $100-$250 USD per month, rural town with a laid-back atmosphere\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Eswatini [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your lifestyle and budget\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find properties that meet your requirements\n- Inspect properties carefully before signing a lease to ensure they are well-maintained\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease to get the best possible deal\n- Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit without a signed lease agreement\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Eswatini, so be prepared to provide your own furniture and appliances\n- Consider purchasing **home insurance** to protect your belongings and property against unforeseen events\n- Always keep a copy of your lease agreement and **proof of payment** to avoid any disputes with your landlord.",
