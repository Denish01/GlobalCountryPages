  "content": "The infrastructure in Eswatini is moderately developed, with a mix of modern and outdated facilities, particularly in the transportation and energy sectors. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 60% of population\nInternet Penetration: 35%\nRoad Network: 3,800 km, moderate quality with some paved highways\nRail Network: 301 km\nMajor Airports: 1 international, 2 domestic\nMajor Ports: landlocked, relying on neighboring countries' ports\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nEswatini's infrastructure development is hindered by its limited resources, geographical constraints, and reliance on neighboring countries for access to ports and international markets. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant investments in recent years to upgrade the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and buildings. However, a significant urban-rural gap persists, with modern amenities and services largely concentrated in urban areas like Mbabane and Manzini, while rural areas often lack access to basic services like electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural electrification programs and water supply systems.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development is also influenced by its strategic location, nestled between South Africa and Mozambique. Eswatini's proximity to these countries has facilitated the development of trade and economic relationships, with many infrastructure projects financed and implemented in collaboration with international partners. For example, the country has received funding from the African Development Bank and the European Union to upgrade its road network and improve its energy sector.\n\nEswatini's infrastructure development is further complicated by the need to balance economic growth with environmental and social concerns. The country is rich in natural resources, including water, minerals, and forests, and the government has implemented policies to ensure that infrastructure development is sustainable and environmentally friendly. For instance, the government has established protected areas and implemented measures to conserve water and reduce pollution.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 3,800 km | Moderate | Paved highways connect major towns, while rural areas have mostly gravel roads |\n| Railways | 301 km | Poor | Limited network, mostly used for freight transport |\n| Airports | 1 international, 2 domestic | Good | Matsapha International Airport serves as the main gateway |\n| Ports | None | N/A | Landlocked, relies on neighboring countries' ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Eswatini's power generation is primarily based on **imported electricity** from South Africa, accounting for over 80% of the country's energy supply.\n- The country has limited **domestic power generation** capacity, with most of it coming from small-scale hydroelectric and diesel-powered plants.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are being explored, with several pilot projects underway.\n- **Power outages** are frequent, particularly during peak demand periods, due to the country's reliance on imported electricity and aging transmission infrastructure.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve the **reliability of the power supply**, including the construction of new transmission lines and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern, with many rural areas lacking access to clean and safe drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with approximately 70% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is often restricted, with many communities relying on traditional sources such as rivers and wells.\n- The government has implemented programs to improve **water supply and sanitation**, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure.\n- **Wastewater management** is a significant challenge, with many urban areas lacking adequate wastewater treatment facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with all major towns and cities having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic connectivity** is limited, with most internet services relying on satellite or wireless connections.\n- The **4G network** is being rolled out, with several mobile operators offering high-speed internet services.\n- **Postal services** are available, with the country's postal corporation offering a range of services, including mail delivery and money transfer.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **telecommunications infrastructure**, including the construction of new fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of existing networks.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Eswatini Transport Master Plan** aims to upgrade the country's road network and improve public transportation services.\n- The **Eswatini Energy Master Plan** seeks to diversify the country's energy mix and reduce its reliance on imported electricity.\n- The **Mbabane Water Supply Project** aims to improve water supply and sanitation services in the capital city.\n- The **Eswatini ICT Policy** aims to improve telecommunications infrastructure and increase access to information and communication technology services.\n- The **Eswatini National Development Strategy** outlines the country's development priorities, including infrastructure development, and provides a framework for implementing these initiatives.",
