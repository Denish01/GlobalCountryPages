        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in <strong>Africa</strong>. The area that is now Eswatini has been inhabited for thousands of years, with the Swazi people settling in the region in the 18th century. The country was colonized by the British in the late 19th century, with the <strong>Anglo-Boer War</strong> leading to the establishment of British control in 1894. Eswatini was a <strong>British protectorate</strong> from 1894 to 1968, when it gained its independence. The country's name was officially changed from Swaziland to Eswatini in 2018.</p>
        <p>The country's founding as a modern nation-state is closely tied to the <strong>Dlamini dynasty</strong>, which has ruled Eswatini since the 18th century. The <strong>Ngwane</strong> people, who are the ancestors of the modern Swazi people, migrated to the region from present-day South Africa in the 18th century. The country's <strong>independence</strong> was achieved on September 6, 1968, with <strong>King Sobhuza II</strong> as the country's first monarch. Since then, Eswatini has been a <strong>constitutional monarchy</strong>, with the king serving as head of state and a prime minister as head of government.</p>
        <p>Eswatini's <strong>independence timeline</strong> is marked by several key events, including the country's first <strong>constitution</strong> in 1968 and the establishment of a <strong>parliament</strong> in 1970. The country has also been a member of the <strong>Commonwealth of Nations</strong> since 1970 and the <strong>United Nations</strong> since 1968. Eswatini's <strong>international relations</strong> have been shaped by its history as a British protectorate and its location in southern Africa, with close ties to neighboring countries such as <strong>South Africa</strong> and <strong>Mozambique</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's <strong>classification</strong> as a <strong>lower-middle-income country</strong> by the World Bank reflects its economic development and challenges. Eswatini's economy is primarily driven by <strong>agriculture</strong> and <strong>mining</strong>, with a growing <strong>services sector</strong>. The country's <strong>currency</strong>, the <strong>Swazi lilangeni</strong> (SZL), is pegged to the <strong>South African rand</strong>. Eswatini's <strong>languages</strong>, <strong>Swazi</strong> and <strong>English</strong>, reflect the country's cultural and historical ties to the region and its former colonial power.</p>
