[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is a **sovereign** country located in **Africa**. The area that is now Eswatini has been inhabited for thousands of years, with the Swazi people settling in the region in the 18th century. The country was colonized by the British in the late 19th century, with the **Anglo-Boer War** leading to the establishment of British control in 1894.
