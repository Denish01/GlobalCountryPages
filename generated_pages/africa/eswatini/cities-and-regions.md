[SECTION] How Eswatini Is Divided [/SECTION]
Eswatini is a small, landlocked country in southern Africa, divided into four administrative regions. These regions are Hhohho, Lubombo, Manzini, and Shiselweni. Each region has its own unique character, with varying landscapes, climates, and economic activities. The regions are further divided into smaller districts, known as "tinkhundla", which are used for local administration and governance.

The four regions are represented in the national government, and each region has its own regional administration, which is responsible for delivering services and implementing national policies at the local level. This system helps to ensure that the needs and concerns of local communities are taken into account in national decision-making.
