Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is a small, landlocked country in southern Africa, offering a unique blend of traditional culture and modern amenities. Compared to its neighbors, South Africa and Mozambique, Eswatini has a relatively low cost of living. The country's affordability makes it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike.
