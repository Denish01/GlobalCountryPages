[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Eswatini is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and garbage collection services. However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher electricity costs during the winter months (June to August) due to increased demand for heating. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of living in Eswatini remains relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

The quality of utility services in Eswatini is generally good, with a high level of access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there are some challenges related to the reliability of services, particularly in rural areas where outages and disruptions can occur more frequently. The government is working to upgrade the utility infrastructure and improve the efficiency of services, which is expected to lead to more stable and affordable utility costs in the long term.
