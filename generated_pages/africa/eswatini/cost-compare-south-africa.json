  "content": "Eswatini is generally cheaper than South Africa, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEswatini GDP per Capita (PPP): $6,458\nSouth Africa GDP per Capita (PPP): $13,440\nEswatini Inflation Rate: 3.6%\nSouth Africa Inflation Rate: 4.6%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Eswatini\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Eswatini vs South Africa [/SECTION]\nEswatini and South Africa are neighboring countries in Southern Africa, with distinct economic profiles. Eswatini, a small, landlocked country, has a relatively low GDP per capita and a high reliance on agriculture and manufacturing. In contrast, South Africa is a more developed economy with a diverse range of industries, including finance, mining, and tourism. The cost of living in Eswatini is generally lower than in South Africa, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper. However, South Africa offers a more developed infrastructure, a wider range of amenities, and a more diverse economy, which can be attractive to expats and investors.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Eswatini's economy is heavily dependent on South Africa, with many Swazi citizens working in South Africa and sending remittances back home. This has led to a relatively stable economy, but also means that Eswatini is vulnerable to economic fluctuations in South Africa. In contrast, South Africa has a more diversified economy, with a strong financial sector and a significant mining industry. This has led to a higher cost of living, particularly in urban areas like Johannesburg and Cape Town. Overall, Eswatini offers a more affordable lifestyle, but with limited job opportunities and a less developed infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Eswatini (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $250 | $400 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $450 | $700 | 35.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Eswatini (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $10 | $15 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $300 | $450 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1.50 | $2.50 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Eswatini (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $0.75 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33.3% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Eswatini (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $80 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $30 | $50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Eswatini (USD) | South Africa (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $800 | $1,200 | 33.3% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,200 | $1,800 | 33.3% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $3,000 | 33.3% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Eswatini is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in South Africa\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries up to 33% cheaper\n  - Transportation, with fuel, taxis, and transit passes up to 33% cheaper\n  - Utilities and internet, with bills up to 50% lower\n- **South Africa is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain luxury items, such as high-end electronics and clothing\n  - International travel, with more flights and destinations available from major airports\n  - Entertainment and leisure activities, such as movies, concerts, and sporting events\n  - Education, with a wider range of universities and colleges offering degree programs\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nEswatini offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, transportation, and utilities.
