The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and long waiting times, while private healthcare is more expensive but offers better facilities and more qualified staff. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. It is recommended that visitors to Eswatini have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high and the quality of care varies greatly depending on the provider.\n\nThe healthcare system in Eswatini is also affected by the country's high rates of **HIV/AIDS** and **tuberculosis**, which put a strain on the public healthcare system. As a result, many people, including foreigners, may find it necessary to seek private medical care, which can be expensive. However, some private hospitals and clinics in Eswatini offer high-quality care and are well-equipped to handle a range of medical conditions, including emergencies.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have long waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Specialist care is often only available in private hospitals |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics offer more comprehensive care |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may have more advanced emergency facilities |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive maternity care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may have more advanced imaging equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Private hospitals may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Covers private healthcare services, including specialist care and advanced procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical evacuation, repatriation, and other international medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be expensive, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 per month\n- Over-the-counter medication is generally cheaper, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 per month\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with many medications requiring a doctor's prescription\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration dates and authenticity of medication before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call the emergency number, 977, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.
