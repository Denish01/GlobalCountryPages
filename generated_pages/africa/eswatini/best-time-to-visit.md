# Best Time to Visit Eswatini — Month-by-Month Guide

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Eswatini: May to September. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: April to May and September to November. Avoid: December to March due to heavy rainfall and high temperatures. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Eswatini has a subtropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the country. During this time, the days are warm and sunny, while the nights can be cool, especially in the mountains. The wet season, which runs from October to April, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making it less ideal for outdoor activities.

The country's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the western highveld being cooler and drier than the eastern lowveld. The highveld is also home to the **Hhohho Region**, which includes the capital city Mbabane, and is known for its scenic mountains and valleys. The lowveld, on the other hand, is hotter and more humid, and is home to the **Lubombo Region**, which is known for its wildlife reserves and game parks.

The seasons in Eswatini have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time for outdoor activities such as hiking, game drives, and birdwatching. The wet season, on the other hand, can make some roads impassable and limit access to certain areas of the country. However, the wet season is also a great time to see the country's lush vegetation and colorful wildflowers.
