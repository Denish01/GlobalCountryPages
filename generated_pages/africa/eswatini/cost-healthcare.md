[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Eswatini has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and long waiting times, while private healthcare is more expensive but offers better facilities and more qualified staff. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. It is recommended that visitors to Eswatini have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high and the quality of care varies greatly depending on the provider.

The healthcare system in Eswatini is also affected by the country's high rates of **HIV/AIDS** and **tuberculosis**, which put a strain on the public healthcare system. As a result, many people, including foreigners, may find it necessary to seek private medical care, which can be expensive. However, some private hospitals and clinics in Eswatini offer high-quality care and are well-equipped to handle a range of medical conditions, including emergencies.
