[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Eswatini's rental market is relatively small, with a mix of modern and traditional housing options available. The demand for rental properties is driven by the growing expat community, students, and young professionals. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by the Rent Control Act, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, South Africa and Mozambique, Eswatini's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center. However, the cost of living in Eswatini is still lower than in many other countries, making it an attractive option for expats and retirees.

The housing market in Eswatini is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the GDP per capita (PPP) of $11,799 indicating a relatively high standard of living. The inflation rate of 2.6% and the out-of-pocket health spend of 11.0% also impact the housing market, as people may allocate a larger portion of their budget to healthcare and other essential expenses. As a result, the demand for affordable housing options is increasing, particularly in the suburbs and rural areas. The government's education spend of 6.0% of GDP also contributes to the growth of the middle class, which in turn drives the demand for better housing options.
