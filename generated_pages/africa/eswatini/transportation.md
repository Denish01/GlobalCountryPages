[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Eswatini is easily accessible by air, with two main international airports: King Mswati III International Airport (SHO) and Matsapha Airport (MTS). King Mswati III International Airport is the primary entry point, with direct flights from Johannesburg, South Africa, and other regional hubs. You can also enter Eswatini by land, with several border crossings from South Africa and Mozambique, including the Ngwenya-Oshoek border post and the Namaacha border post. Overland travel is a great way to see the scenery and experience the local culture, and many tour operators offer bus and shuttle services from nearby cities.

If you're coming from outside the region, you may need to connect through a major hub like Johannesburg or Maputo. From there, you can take a domestic flight or bus to Eswatini. Several airlines, including South African Airways and Airlink, offer flights to Eswatini, and bus companies like Intercape and Translux operate daily services from Johannesburg and other nearby cities. Be sure to check the latest entry requirements and border crossing information before your trip, as these can change frequently.

Eswatini has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating within the country. **Airlink** and **Royal Swazi Airways** offer flights between King Mswati III International Airport and other smaller airports, including Matsapha Airport and Piggs Peak Airport. These flights can be convenient for traveling to remote areas or for those short on time. However, booking in advance is recommended, as flights can be infrequent and may fill up quickly. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Eswatini has no rail network, so train travel is not an option within the country. However, you can take a train to nearby cities in South Africa or Mozambique and then transfer to a bus or taxi to continue your journey to Eswatini. If you're looking for a scenic and relaxing way to travel, consider taking a train to a nearby city and then exploring Eswatini by car or bus.
