Eswatini has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, while Lesotho's economy is primarily driven by textiles and mining. In terms of cost of living, Eswatini is generally cheaper than Lesotho, with a lower overall cost of living index.

Eswatini has a more stable economy, with a lower inflation rate and a higher GDP per capita. This stability is reflected in the country's lower prices for goods and services.
