# Eswatini Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Eswatini is moderately developed, with a mix of modern and outdated facilities, particularly in the transportation and energy sectors. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 60% of population
Internet Penetration: 35%
Road Network: 3,800 km, moderate quality with some paved highways
Rail Network: 301 km
Major Airports: 1 international, 2 domestic
Major Ports: landlocked, relying on neighboring countries' ports
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Eswatini's infrastructure development is hindered by its limited resources, geographical constraints, and reliance on neighboring countries for access to ports and international markets. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant investments in recent years to upgrade the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and buildings. However, a significant urban-rural gap persists, with modern amenities and services largely concentrated in urban areas like Mbabane and Manzini, while rural areas often lack access to basic services like electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural electrification programs and water supply systems.

The country's infrastructure development is also influenced by its strategic location, nestled between South Africa and Mozambique. Eswatini's proximity to these countries has facilitated the development of trade and economic relationships, with many infrastructure projects financed and implemented in collaboration with international partners. For example, the country has received funding from the African Development Bank and the European Union to upgrade its road network and improve its energy sector.

Eswatini's infrastructure development is further complicated by the need to balance economic growth with environmental and social concerns. The country is rich in natural resources, including water, minerals, and forests, and the government has implemented policies to ensure that infrastructure development is sustainable and environmentally friendly. For instance, the government has established protected areas and implemented measures to conserve water and reduce pollution.
