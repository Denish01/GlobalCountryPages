[SECTION] Overview: Eswatini vs South Africa [/SECTION]
Eswatini and South Africa are neighboring countries in Southern Africa, with distinct economic profiles. Eswatini, a small, landlocked country, has a relatively low GDP per capita and a high reliance on agriculture and manufacturing. In contrast, South Africa is a more developed economy with a diverse range of industries, including finance, mining, and tourism. The cost of living in Eswatini is generally lower than in South Africa, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper. However, South Africa offers a more developed infrastructure, a wider range of amenities, and a more diverse economy, which can be attractive to expats and investors.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Eswatini's economy is heavily dependent on South Africa, with many Swazi citizens working in South Africa and sending remittances back home. This has led to a relatively stable economy, but also means that Eswatini is vulnerable to economic fluctuations in South Africa. In contrast, South Africa has a more diversified economy, with a strong financial sector and a significant mining industry. This has led to a higher cost of living, particularly in urban areas like Johannesburg and Cape Town. Overall, Eswatini offers a more affordable lifestyle, but with limited job opportunities and a less developed infrastructure.
