King Mswati III International Airport is the primary entry point, with direct flights from Johannesburg, South Africa, and other regional hubs. You can also enter Eswatini by land, with several border crossings from South Africa and Mozambique, including the Ngwenya-Oshoek border post and the Namaacha border post. Overland travel is a great way to see the scenery and experience the local culture, and many tour operators offer bus and shuttle services from nearby cities.\n\nIf you're coming from outside the region, you may need to connect through a major hub like Johannesburg or Maputo.
