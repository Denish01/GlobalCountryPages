The monarch serves as the head of state and is responsible for appointing the prime minister, who is the head of government. The legislative branch is composed of a bicameral parliament, consisting of the House of Assembly and the Senate. The House of Assembly has 59 elected members, while the Senate has 30 members, with 20 appointed by the king and 10 elected by the House of Assembly. The government is unitary, with a centralized authority in the capital city of Mbabane.\n\nThe separation of powers in Eswatini is limited, as the monarch holds significant influence over the legislative and executive branches. The king has the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, as well as dissolve the parliament. The judiciary is also subject to the monarch's influence, as the king appoints the chief justice and other judges. Despite these limitations, the government has made efforts to increase transparency and accountability, including the establishment of an anti-corruption commission.\n\nThe political system in Eswatini has faced criticism for its lack of democratic representation and human rights concerns. The monarch's significant powers and influence over the government have led to accusations of authoritarianism. However, the government has taken steps to address these concerns, including the introduction of a new constitution in 2005, which provides for increased protections for human rights and the rule of law.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the King | King Mswati III | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Office of the Prime Minister | Prime Minister Cleopas Dlamini | Head of government |\n| Legislative | House of Assembly | Speaker of the House | Elected representatives |\n| Legislative | Senate | President of the Senate | Appointed and elected representatives |\n| Judicial | Judicial Service Commission | Chief Justice | Administration of justice |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Imbokodvo National Movement | Royalist | King Mswati III |  | Supports the monarch and traditional governance |\n| Ngwane National Liberatory Congress | Opposition | Obed Dlamini |  | Advocates for democratic reforms and human rights |\n| People's United Democratic Movement | Opposition | Mario Masuku |  | Seeks to promote democracy and social justice |\n| Swaziland Democratic Party | Opposition | Jan Sithole |  | Supports democratic reforms and economic development |\n| Swaziland National Association of Teachers | Interest group | Sibongile Mazibuko |  | Represents the interests of teachers and education workers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Eswatini is based on a non-party system, where candidates run as individuals rather than representatives of political parties.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent election taking place in 2018.\n- The last election saw a turnout of approximately 50% of registered voters, with the majority of candidates running as independents.\n- The next election is scheduled to take place in 2023, although the exact date has not been announced.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Eswatini is marked by tensions between the monarch and opposition groups, who are seeking democratic reforms and greater representation.\n- Key issues facing the government include poverty, unemployment, and access to education and healthcare.\n- Regional dynamics play a significant role in Eswatini's politics, with the country being a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU).\n- Eswatini has been ranked as \"not free\" by Freedom House, with concerns over human rights, freedom of speech, and democratic representation.\n- The country has also faced criticism over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with concerns over access to healthcare and economic support for vulnerable populations.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Eswatini is a member of the United Nations (UN), the African Union (AU), and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\n- The country has diplomatic relations with a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa.\n- Eswatini has a long-standing relationship with Taiwan, which has provided significant economic and development support to the country.\n- The country has also sought to strengthen its ties with other African countries, particularly through its membership in the AU and SADC.\n- Eswatini has faced criticism over its human rights record, with some countries and organizations calling for greater accountability and democratic reforms.",
