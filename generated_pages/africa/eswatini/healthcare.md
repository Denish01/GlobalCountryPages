[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Eswatini is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private sectors. The public sector is primarily funded by the government and provides free or low-cost healthcare services to the majority of the population, particularly in rural areas. However, the public sector is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality care, but is generally more expensive and catered towards those who can afford it. The quality of care in Eswatini is generally considered to be good, with many healthcare professionals being well-trained and experienced. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of healthcare infrastructure, equipment, and resources, particularly in rural areas.

The urban-rural divide is a significant factor in healthcare access and quality in Eswatini. Urban areas, such as Mbabane and Manzini, have better-equipped hospitals and more specialized healthcare services, while rural areas often have limited access to basic healthcare services. This can lead to significant disparities in health outcomes and access to care, particularly for those living in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve healthcare access and quality, including the implementation of a national health insurance scheme and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.

Overall, while the healthcare system in Eswatini has its challenges, it is generally considered to be good, with many healthcare professionals being well-trained and experienced. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of healthcare infrastructure, equipment, and resources, particularly in rural areas. It is essential for individuals traveling to or living in Eswatini to have adequate health insurance coverage and to take necessary precautions to stay healthy.
