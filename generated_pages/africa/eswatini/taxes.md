[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Eswatini has a **territorial taxation system**, where residents are taxed on their locally sourced income, while non-residents are taxed on their income derived from Eswatini sources.

To be considered a tax resident in Eswatini, an individual must be physically present in the country for at least 91 days in the tax year, or have a permanent home in Eswatini and be physically present in the country for at least 30 days in the tax year.

The tax authority in Eswatini is the **Eswatini Revenue Authority (SRA)**, which is responsible for the collection of taxes, including income tax, corporate tax, and VAT.
