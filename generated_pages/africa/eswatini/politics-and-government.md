[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Eswatini operates under an absolute monarchy, where the king holds significant executive powers. The monarch serves as the head of state and is responsible for appointing the prime minister, who is the head of government. The legislative branch is composed of a bicameral parliament, consisting of the House of Assembly and the Senate. The House of Assembly has 59 elected members, while the Senate has 30 members, with 20 appointed by the king and 10 elected by the House of Assembly. The government is unitary, with a centralized authority in the capital city of Mbabane.

The separation of powers in Eswatini is limited, as the monarch holds significant influence over the legislative and executive branches. The king has the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, as well as dissolve the parliament. The judiciary is also subject to the monarch's influence, as the king appoints the chief justice and other judges. Despite these limitations, the government has made efforts to increase transparency and accountability, including the establishment of an anti-corruption commission.

The political system in Eswatini has faced criticism for its lack of democratic representation and human rights concerns. The monarch's significant powers and influence over the government have led to accusations of authoritarianism. However, the government has taken steps to address these concerns, including the introduction of a new constitution in 2005, which provides for increased protections for human rights and the rule of law.
