        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Eswatini, a small, landlocked country in Southern Africa, has a lower-middle-income economy. The country's economic development is driven by a mix of agriculture, manufacturing, and services. With a GDP per capita of approximately $3,970, Eswatini has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards. However, the economy still faces challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a heavy reliance on a few key industries. The government has implemented policies to diversify the economy and attract foreign investment, but progress has been slow.</p>
        <p>Eswatini's economy is heavily influenced by its neighbors, South Africa and Mozambique. The country is a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which provides access to a larger market and facilitates trade. However, the economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in trade policies. The government has implemented measures to reduce its dependence on a few key exports and to promote economic diversification.</p>
        <p>The country's economic trajectory is closely tied to its natural resources, including sugar, coal, and iron ore. The government has invested in infrastructure development, including roads, railways, and ports, to facilitate trade and attract investment. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled labor, limited access to finance, and a high cost of doing business. The government has implemented policies to address these challenges, including the establishment of a national development strategy and the creation of a business-friendly environment.</p>
