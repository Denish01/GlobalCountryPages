Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is a small, landlocked country in southern Africa that is generally considered safe for tourists. The country has a low crime rate compared to other African nations, and visitors can feel relatively secure when exploring the country's many natural attractions and cultural sites. However, as with any travel destination, there are some safety concerns that visitors should be aware of. Petty crimes, such as pickpocketing and theft, can occur in crowded areas and tourist hotspots, and visitors should take the usual precautions to protect themselves and their belongings.

Despite the overall safety of Eswatini, there are some areas that are best avoided, particularly at night.

By taking the necessary precautions and being aware of their surroundings, visitors can have a safe and enjoyable trip to Eswatini.
