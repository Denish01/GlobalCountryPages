Eswatini, a small, landlocked country, has a higher GDP per capita and a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Mozambique, on the other hand, is a larger country with a lower GDP per capita and a more limited economy, heavily reliant on natural resources and agriculture. In terms of cost of living, Mozambique is generally cheaper than Eswatini, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Eswatini has a more stable economy, with a strong currency and a relatively low inflation rate, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Mozambique, on the other hand, has a more volatile economy, with a weaker currency and a higher inflation rate, which makes it more affordable for expats and tourists. Overall, Mozambique is approximately 20-30% cheaper than Eswatini, making it a more attractive option for those looking for a lower cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Eswatini (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $250 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $250 | $150 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $800 | $500 | 37.5% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Eswatini (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $15 | $10 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $300 | $200 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $3 | $2 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $2 | $1.50 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Eswatini (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1.50 | $1 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1 | 16.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Eswatini (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $100 | $80 | 20% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $20 | $15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Eswatini (USD) | Mozambique (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $800 | $500 | 37.5% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,200 | $800 | 33.3% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $1,200 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Eswatini is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end accommodations and luxury goods\n  - Certain imported goods, such as electronics and clothing\n  - Access to high-quality healthcare and education\n  - A more stable and secure environment\n- **Mozambique is cheaper for:**\n  - Basic necessities, such as food and transportation\n  - Accommodation, particularly outside of city centers\n  - Certain recreational activities, such as outdoor adventures and cultural events\n  - A more authentic and immersive local experience\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMozambique offers better value for those looking for a lower cost of living, particularly for basic necessities and accommodation.
