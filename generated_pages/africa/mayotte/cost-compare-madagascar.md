[SECTION] Overview: Mayotte vs Madagascar [/SECTION]
Mayotte, an overseas department of France, and Madagascar, an island nation off the coast of East Africa, have distinct economic contexts that impact their cost of living. Mayotte's economy is closely tied to France, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a largely rural population and a struggling economy. As a result, Madagascar tends to be significantly cheaper than Mayotte, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. The overall cost of living in Mayotte is around 30-50% higher than in Madagascar, making Madagascar a more attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Mayotte's strong economy and high standard of living are reflected in its higher prices, while Madagascar's struggling economy and limited infrastructure contribute to its lower costs. However, it's essential to note that while Madagascar may be cheaper, it also lacks the modern amenities and services that Mayotte offers. Mayotte's higher cost of living is offset by its better healthcare, education, and infrastructure, making it a more appealing option for those who value these services.
