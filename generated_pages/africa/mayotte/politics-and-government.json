The Departmental Council of Mayotte, composed of 26 members, is the legislative body responsible for making laws and decisions for the territory. Mayotte's political system is characterized by a **unitary** system, where the central government in France has significant control over the territory's affairs. The separation of powers is also present, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **executive** branch is responsible for enforcing laws, the **legislative** branch for making laws, and the **judicial** branch for interpreting laws.\n\nThe political system in Mayotte is also influenced by its history and cultural context. The territory has a unique cultural identity, with a mix of French, African, and Islamic influences.
