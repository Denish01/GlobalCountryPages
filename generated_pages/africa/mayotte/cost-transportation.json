The main transportation modes in Mayotte include buses, taxis, and car rentals, with bicycles and walking also being popular options in smaller towns and villages. The quality of public transit is limited, with infrequent bus services and no metro or subway system, making it challenging for visitors to navigate the island without a car.\n\nThe majority of people in Mayotte get around by car, with many residents owning their own vehicles due to the lack of reliable public transportation. Taxis are also widely available, but can be more expensive than in other parts of the world. For shorter distances, bicycles and walking are good options, especially in the capital city of Mamoudzou, where the terrain is relatively flat and the climate is warm. However, for longer distances or traveling to more remote areas, a car or taxi is often necessary.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1 | $30 | Limited coverage, infrequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2 | N/A | Limited routes, often crowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2 | $1.50 | $5-10 | Available at airports and towns |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-30 | To city center, available at airport |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, manual transmission |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, no toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Limited services, often crowded |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-200 | From Mayotte to other French territories |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider renting a car for flexibility and convenience, especially for longer distances or traveling to remote areas.\n- Always negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, as meters may not be used.\n- Be aware of limited parking options in cities and towns, and plan accordingly.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or airport transfer services for safety and reliability.\n- Check the condition and insurance of rental cars before hiring, as road conditions can be challenging.\n- Download maps or guides to help navigate the island, as signage may be limited in some areas.",
