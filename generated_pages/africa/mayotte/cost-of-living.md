[SECTION] How Expensive Is Mayotte? [/SECTION]
Mayotte, an overseas department of France located in the Indian Ocean, has a unique blend of French and African influences, which is reflected in its cost of living. Compared to other African countries, Mayotte is relatively expensive, but it remains more affordable than many European destinations. The cost of living in Mayotte is influenced by its remote location, limited local production, and reliance on imports from France and other countries. As a result, prices for goods and services can be higher than in neighboring countries, such as the Comoros or Madagascar.

The cost of living in Mayotte is also affected by the island's growing tourism industry, which has led to an increase in demand for accommodations, food, and activities. However, the local economy is still relatively small, and the cost of living can vary depending on the location, with the capital city of Mamoudzou tend to be more expensive than other parts of the island.
