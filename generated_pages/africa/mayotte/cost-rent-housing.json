Typical lease terms are for one to three years, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by French law, which applies in Mayotte as an overseas department of France. The housing costs in Mayotte are relatively higher compared to its regional neighbors, such as the Comoros and Madagascar, due to its status as a French territory and the resulting higher cost of living. However, the costs are still lower compared to other French overseas departments, such as Réunion.\n\nThe housing market in Mayotte is also influenced by the island's remote location and limited availability of land, which can drive up prices. Additionally, the market is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with prices tend to be higher during the peak tourist season. Despite these challenges, Mayotte's housing market offers a unique opportunity for expats and locals alike to experience a blend of French and African cultures in a beautiful island setting. The local government has also implemented initiatives to increase the availability of affordable housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build more affordable units.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | 300-450 | 200-350 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | 400-600 | 250-450 | compact, modern apartments |\n| 2 Bedroom | 600-900 | 400-700 | family-sized, comfortable apartments |\n| 3 Bedroom | 900-1,200 | 600-1,000 | spacious, luxurious apartments |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | 2,500-4,000 | prime locations, modern apartments |\n| Suburbs | 1,500-3,000 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | 1,000-2,000 | rural areas, traditional houses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Mamoudzou**: the capital city, with a range of accommodation options, from studios to family-sized apartments, and a vibrant cultural scene, with rents ranging from $400 to $1,200 per month.\n- **Dzaoudzi**: a charming town with a rich history, offering a mix of modern and traditional housing, and a relaxed atmosphere, with rents ranging from $300 to $900 per month.\n- **Pamandzi**: a coastal town with beautiful beaches, popular with expats and locals alike, and a range of accommodation options, from apartments to villas, with rents ranging from $500 to $1,500 per month.\n- **Koungou**: a suburban area with a mix of modern and traditional housing, and a convenient location, with rents ranging from $250 to $800 per month.\n- **Sada**: a rural area with traditional houses and a peaceful atmosphere, popular with those seeking a more laid-back lifestyle, with rents ranging from $200 to $600 per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Mayotte [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to find the best deals and avoid overpriced accommodations.\n- Consider working with a local real estate agent to find a suitable apartment or house.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease.\n- Check the condition of the property carefully before signing the lease to avoid any potential disputes.\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and internet are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget.\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Mayotte, so be prepared to purchase or rent furniture if necessary.",
