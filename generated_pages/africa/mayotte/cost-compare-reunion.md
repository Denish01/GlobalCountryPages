[SECTION] Overview: Mayotte vs Reunion [/SECTION]
Mayotte and Reunion are two island territories in the Indian Ocean, both under French jurisdiction. While they share some cultural and economic similarities, their cost of living differs significantly. Mayotte, being a smaller and less developed island, has a lower cost of living compared to Reunion. The main reason for this difference is the lower cost of housing, food, and transportation in Mayotte. Additionally, Mayotte's economy is more focused on agriculture and fishing, which contributes to its lower cost of living.

The economic context of both islands also plays a role in their cost of living. Reunion has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, which drives up prices for accommodations, food, and activities. In contrast, Mayotte's economy is more reliant on local industries, which keeps prices lower. Overall, Mayotte is a more affordable option for those looking to live or visit the Indian Ocean islands. However, it's essential to note that Reunion offers a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which may be worth the extra cost for some individuals.
