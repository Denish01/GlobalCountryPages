The public healthcare system is generally of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment, but it can be slow and bureaucratic. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers more personalized and prompt care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare due to language barriers and the desire for more personalized care. Having health insurance is recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the costs of private healthcare and provide access to better facilities and services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Mayotte is generally well-organized, with a network of public hospitals, clinics, and health centers that provide a wide range of medical services. However, the system can be slow, and wait times can be long, especially for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer more prompt and personalized care, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it's often recommended to have private health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare and to provide access to better facilities and services. Additionally, many private health insurance plans offer coverage for medical evacuation to France or other countries, which can be important for serious medical conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals and clinics offer GP services, while private clinics offer more personalized care |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Specialist consultations are available at public hospitals, but wait times can be long |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public dental clinics offer basic dental care, while private clinics offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals and clinics offer basic eye exams, while private clinics offer more comprehensive services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public hospitals and clinics offer basic blood tests, while private clinics offer more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals offer emergency room services, while private clinics offer more prompt care |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$200 | Public hospitals offer basic hospital stays, while private clinics offer more comfortable and personalized care |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Public hospitals offer basic surgical services, while private clinics offer more comprehensive and specialized care |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,000 | Public hospitals offer basic maternity services, while private clinics offer more personalized and comprehensive care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public hospitals offer basic imaging services, while private clinics offer more comprehensive and specialized testing |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals and clinics offer basic X-ray services, while private clinics offer more comprehensive imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic surgical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Covers comprehensive medical services, including specialist consultations, hospital stays, and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers comprehensive medical services, including medical evacuation to France or other countries, and offers more personalized and prompt care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication is widely available at pharmacies, but can be expensive, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medication is also widely available, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 per medication\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not always have the latest or most specialized medications\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with many medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good, with many pharmacies located throughout the island\n- Common medications, such as pain relievers and antibiotics, are generally affordable and widely available\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the local emergency number, 15, which will connect you to the emergency services.
