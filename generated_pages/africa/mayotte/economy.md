[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Mayotte has a developing economy, classified as lower-middle income by the World Bank. The territory's economic development is hindered by its limited land area, lack of natural resources, and high dependence on imported goods. Despite these challenges, Mayotte has experienced steady economic growth in recent years, driven by investments in infrastructure and tourism. The economy is heavily reliant on financial support from France, which provides significant subsidies and funding for public services.

The economic trajectory of Mayotte is expected to continue on a path of gradual growth, driven by the expansion of the services sector and the development of the tourism industry. However, the territory faces significant challenges, including high unemployment, limited economic diversification, and a dependence on imported goods. Efforts to promote economic development and reduce poverty are ongoing, with a focus on improving education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

Mayotte's economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in the global economic environment. The territory's remote location and limited connectivity also pose challenges for trade and investment.
