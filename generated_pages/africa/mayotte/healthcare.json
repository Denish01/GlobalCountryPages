The system is designed to provide comprehensive coverage to all residents, with a mix of public and private healthcare providers. The quality of care is generally good, especially in urban areas like Mamoudzou, where there are several well-equipped hospitals and clinics. However, in rural areas, access to healthcare can be limited, and the quality of care may be more variable. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, but private healthcare providers may offer more specialized services and shorter waiting times.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Mayotte is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions. Patients are required to pay a portion of their healthcare costs, but the majority of costs are covered by the government.
