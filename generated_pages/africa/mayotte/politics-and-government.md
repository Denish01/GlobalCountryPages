[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Mayotte is based on the French system, with the President of France serving as the head of state and the Prefect of Mayotte as the head of government. The Departmental Council of Mayotte, composed of 26 members, is the legislative body responsible for making laws and decisions for the territory. Mayotte's political system is characterized by a **unitary** system, where the central government in France has significant control over the territory's affairs. The separation of powers is also present, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **executive** branch is responsible for enforcing laws, the **legislative** branch for making laws, and the **judicial** branch for interpreting laws.

The political system in Mayotte is also influenced by its history and cultural context. The territory has a unique cultural identity, with a mix of French, African, and Islamic influences. This diversity is reflected in the territory's **language**, with French being the official language, but many residents also speaking Mahorais, a local dialect. The **currency** used in Mayotte is the Euro, which is the same as in France.

Mayotte's relationship with France is also an important aspect of its political system. As an overseas department and region of France, Mayotte is represented in the French National Assembly and Senate, and its residents are French citizens. This relationship provides Mayotte with access to French funding, infrastructure, and services, but it also means that the territory has limited autonomy and decision-making power.
