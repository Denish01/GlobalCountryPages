[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Mayotte is characterized by the dominance of French, which is the language used in government, education, and media. However, many locals also speak Shimaore, a Bantu language that is closely related to the languages spoken in the Comoros Islands. Kibushi, a Malagasy language, is also spoken by some people, particularly in the northern part of the island. English is not widely spoken, and visitors may find it difficult to communicate with locals who do not speak French. Despite this, many younger people and those in the tourism industry may have some knowledge of English.

The regional dialects of Mayotte are influenced by the island's history and cultural ties to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Shimaore, for example, has been influenced by Arabic and French, and is spoken with a distinct accent and vocabulary. Kibushi, on the other hand, is more closely related to the languages spoken in Madagascar, and is spoken by people who have ancestral ties to the island.

Minority languages are also spoken in Mayotte, including Malagasy and Makonde, which are spoken by people who have migrated to the island from other parts of Africa. However, French remains the dominant language, and is widely used in all aspects of life, including government, education, and commerce.
