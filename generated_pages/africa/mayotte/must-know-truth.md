# The Truth About Mayotte - History & Real Facts

Most people are unaware that Mayotte, an overseas department of France, has a unique cultural and historical context that sets it apart from other islands in the Indian Ocean. 

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Mayotte, located in the Comoros archipelago, has a complex history that dates back to the 8th century when it was inhabited by Austronesian peoples. The island was later influenced by Arabic and Islamic cultures, and in the 16th century, it was visited by European explorers, including the Portuguese and the French. In 1843, Mayotte became a French colony, and it remained under French control until 1975 when the Comoros archipelago gained independence. However, Mayotte chose to remain a part of France, and in 2011, it became an overseas department of France.
The decision to remain a part of France was the result of a referendum held in 1974, in which 63.8% of the population voted to maintain their ties with France. This decision was influenced by the island's economic and cultural ties with France, as well as concerns about the potential instability of an independent Comoros.
