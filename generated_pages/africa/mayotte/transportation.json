  "content": "To get around in Mayotte, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and car rentals, as well as ride-hailing apps, with the island's limited road network and lack of rail connections presenting some challenges.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Dzaoudzi Pamandzi International Airport, DZA\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nMayotte is accessible by air and sea, with Dzaoudzi Pamandzi International Airport being the main entry point. The airport receives flights from Paris, Marseille, and other French cities, as well as from neighboring islands such as the Comoros and Madagascar. There are also direct flights from Reunion Island and other parts of the Indian Ocean. If you're coming from outside France, you may need to connect through a French airport or another island in the region.\n\nOverland entry points are limited, as Mayotte is an island, but you can arrive by ferry from the Comoros or other nearby islands. The ferry journey can be long and unpredictable, depending on the weather and sea conditions. It's generally recommended to fly into Mayotte, as this is the fastest and most convenient way to get to the island. If you do decide to take the ferry, be sure to check the latest schedules and prices in advance, as they can change frequently.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nMayotte has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting the island's two main airports: Dzaoudzi Pamandzi International Airport and Pamandzi Airport. The main domestic airline is **Air Mayotte**, which operates flights between the two airports. You can book flights online or through a local travel agent, and prices are generally reasonable, with a one-way ticket costing around $50-$100. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as flights can fill up quickly.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nMayotte does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option on the island. This is due to the island's small size and limited infrastructure, as well as the fact that it is a relatively remote territory. As a result, you'll need to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nMayotte has a limited bus network, with services connecting the main towns and villages. The buses are generally not very frequent, and the roads can be rough, so it's not always the most comfortable way to travel. However, it is a cheap option, with fares starting from around $1-$2. You can catch buses at the main bus station in Mamoudzou, or along the side of the road, but be prepared for a bumpy ride and limited amenities.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Mamoudzou, other towns | $1-$2 | Limited frequency |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10/km | Metered fares |\n| Ride-Hailing | Mamoudzou, other towns | $5-$10 | Local apps only |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Not available | - | - |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Mayotte, you'll need a valid **driver's license** from your home country or an **International Driving Permit**.\n- The road conditions on the island are generally poor, with many unpaved roads and limited street lighting.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, due to the island's remote location and limited supply.\n- Car rental companies are available at the airport and in Mamoudzou, but be sure to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n- When driving on the island, be aware of the **speed limits**, which are generally lower than in other countries, and watch out for **pedestrians** and **animals** on the road.\n- It's also a good idea to have a **4WD vehicle**, as some roads can be rough and uneven, especially during the rainy season.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced taxis or fake tour operators.\n- Always **agree on a price** before getting into a taxi or bus, to avoid any disputes later on.\n- **Download local apps**, such as ride-hailing or transportation apps, to help you get around the island.\n- **Learn some basic French**, as this is the main language spoken on the island, and not everyone speaks English.\n- **Be prepared for delays**, as the island's transportation network can be unpredictable, especially during peak travel seasons.\n- **Respect local customs** and traditions, especially when traveling to rural areas or interacting with local communities.\n- **Bring a **map** or **GPS device**, as signposting can be limited, and it's easy to get lost on the island's winding roads.",
