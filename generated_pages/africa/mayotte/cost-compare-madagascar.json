  "content": "Mayotte is generally more expensive than Madagascar, with a cost of living difference of around 30-50% in various categories.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMayotte GDP per Capita (PPP): 11,400\nMadagascar GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,600\nMayotte Inflation Rate: 1.5%\nMadagascar Inflation Rate: 6.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Madagascar\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Mayotte vs Madagascar [/SECTION]\nMayotte, an overseas department of France, and Madagascar, an island nation off the coast of East Africa, have distinct economic contexts that impact their cost of living. Mayotte's economy is closely tied to France, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a largely rural population and a struggling economy. As a result, Madagascar tends to be significantly cheaper than Mayotte, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. The overall cost of living in Mayotte is around 30-50% higher than in Madagascar, making Madagascar a more attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Mayotte's strong economy and high standard of living are reflected in its higher prices, while Madagascar's struggling economy and limited infrastructure contribute to its lower costs. However, it's essential to note that while Madagascar may be cheaper, it also lacks the modern amenities and services that Mayotte offers. Mayotte's higher cost of living is offset by its better healthcare, education, and infrastructure, making it a more appealing option for those who value these services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mayotte (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 200 | 125% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 300 | 150 | 100% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 400 | 100% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mayotte (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 5 | 200% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 150 | 100% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 2 | 150% more |\n| Coffee | 3 | 1 | 200% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mayotte (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 20 | 150% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1 | 100% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.5 | 1 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mayotte (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 50 | 200% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 20 | 50% more |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 10 | 100% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mayotte (USD) | Madagascar (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 600 | 50% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,000 | 1,000 | 50% |\n| Comfortable | 3,500 | 2,000 | 43% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mayotte is cheaper for:**\n- High-end dining and entertainment options\n- Modern amenities and services\n- Better healthcare and education facilities\n- **Madagascar is cheaper for:**\n- Housing and accommodation\n- Food and groceries\n- Transportation and fuel\n- Local handicrafts and souvenirs\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Madagascar offers better value for money, with significantly lower costs for housing, food, and transportation.
