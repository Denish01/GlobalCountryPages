[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Mayotte is accessible by air and sea, with Dzaoudzi Pamandzi International Airport being the main entry point. The airport receives flights from Paris, Marseille, and other French cities, as well as from neighboring islands such as the Comoros and Madagascar. There are also direct flights from Reunion Island and other parts of the Indian Ocean. If you're coming from outside France, you may need to connect through a French airport or another island in the region.

Overland entry points are limited, as Mayotte is an island, but you can arrive by ferry from the Comoros or other nearby islands. The ferry journey can be long and unpredictable, depending on the weather and sea conditions. It's generally recommended to fly into Mayotte, as this is the fastest and most convenient way to get to the island. If you do decide to take the ferry, be sure to check the latest schedules and prices in advance, as they can change frequently.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Mayotte has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting the island's two main airports: Dzaoudzi Pamandzi International Airport and Pamandzi Airport. The main domestic airline is **Air Mayotte**, which operates flights between the two airports. You can book flights online or through a local travel agent, and prices are generally reasonable, with a one-way ticket costing around $50-$100. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as flights can fill up quickly.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Mayotte does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option on the island. This is due to the island's small size and limited infrastructure, as well as the fact that it is a relatively remote territory. As a result, you'll need to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Mayotte has a limited bus network, with services connecting the main towns and villages. The buses are generally not very frequent, and the roads can be rough, so it's not always the most comfortable way to travel. However, it is a cheap option, with fares starting from around $1-$2. You can catch buses at the main bus station in Mamoudzou, or along the side of the road, but be prepared for a bumpy ride and limited amenities.
