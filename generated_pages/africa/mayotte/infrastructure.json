  "content": "The infrastructure in Mayotte, an overseas territory of France, is moderately developed, with a focus on improving road networks, energy production, and telecommunications, while still facing challenges in providing access to clean water and sanitation, especially in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 90% of population\nInternet Penetration: 25%\nRoad Network: 200 km, paved and in good condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMayotte's infrastructure development is driven by its status as an overseas territory of France, with significant investments in recent years to upgrade its roads, energy production, and telecommunications. The territory's infrastructure is generally more developed in urban areas, such as the capital Mamoudzou, compared to rural areas, where access to basic services like electricity, water, and sanitation can be limited. Despite these challenges, Mayotte's infrastructure is considered to be in relatively good condition compared to other islands in the region.\n\nThe French government has invested heavily in Mayotte's infrastructure, with a focus on improving the territory's connectivity and economic development. This includes investments in the road network, which has been significantly upgraded in recent years, as well as the development of a new port and airport facilities. However, the territory still faces significant challenges in providing access to clean water and sanitation, particularly in rural areas, where many households rely on traditional wells and latrines.\n\nMayotte's infrastructure development is also influenced by its geographic location, with the territory being prone to natural disasters such as cyclones and floods. As a result, there is a need for infrastructure that is resilient to these events, and that can provide essential services such as electricity, water, and telecommunications in the aftermath of a disaster.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 200 km | Good | Paved and well-maintained, with a focus on connecting urban centers |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in Mayotte |\n| Airports | 1 international, 0 domestic | Good | Dzaoudzi Pamandzi International Airport serves as the main gateway to the territory |\n| Ports | 1 major | Good | The port of Longoni is the main port facility in Mayotte, handling cargo and passenger traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Mayotte's energy production is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a focus on diesel and heavy fuel oil.\n- The territory has a total installed capacity of 50 MW, with a mix of thermal and renewable energy sources.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly important in Mayotte's energy mix, with several projects underway to develop new capacity.\n- The territory's power grid is generally reliable, with a low frequency of **power outages**.\n- However, the high cost of energy production in Mayotte, due to its reliance on imported fuels, is a significant challenge for the territory's economy and residents.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is available in most urban areas, but its safety and quality can vary, with some households relying on bottled or filtered water.\n- Sanitation coverage is limited, particularly in rural areas, where many households rely on traditional **latrines** and **septic tanks**.\n- Access to clean **water** is a significant challenge in rural areas, where many households rely on traditional wells and **rainwater harvesting**.\n- The territory's water supply is vulnerable to **drought** and **flooding**, which can impact the availability and quality of water.\n- Efforts are underway to improve sanitation coverage and access to clean water, including the development of new **wastewater treatment** facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Mayotte, with several operators providing services, including 2G, 3G, and 4G networks.\n- **Fiber-optic** cables connect Mayotte to the global telecommunications network, providing high-speed internet access.\n- **Broadband** internet is available in most urban areas, but its penetration is limited in rural areas, where many households rely on **mobile internet**.\n- The territory's telecommunications sector is **liberalized**, with several operators competing for market share.\n- Efforts are underway to improve **telecommunications infrastructure**, including the rollout of new 4G and 5G networks.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- A new **port facility** is under construction in Mayotte, which will increase the territory's cargo handling capacity and improve its connectivity to the global economy.\n- The French government has committed to investing in Mayotte's **road network**, with a focus on upgrading existing roads and building new ones to connect urban and rural areas.\n- A new **airport terminal** is planned for Dzaoudzi Pamandzi International Airport, which will increase the airport's capacity and improve its facilities.\n- Efforts are underway to develop **renewable energy** sources in Mayotte, including solar and wind power, which will help reduce the territory's reliance on imported fuels.\n- The European Union has provided funding for several **infrastructure projects** in Mayotte, including the development of new wastewater treatment facilities and the upgrade of existing water supply systems.",
