[/SECTION]\nMayotte, an overseas department of France located in the Indian Ocean, has a unique blend of French and African influences, which is reflected in its cost of living. Compared to other African countries, Mayotte is relatively expensive, but it remains more affordable than many European destinations. The cost of living in Mayotte is influenced by its remote location, limited local production, and reliance on imports from France and other countries. As a result, prices for goods and services can be higher than in neighboring countries, such as the Comoros or Madagascar.\n\nThe cost of living in Mayotte is also affected by the island's growing tourism industry, which has led to an increase in demand for accommodations, food, and activities. However, the local economy is still relatively small, and the cost of living can vary depending on the location, with the capital city of Mamoudzou tend to be more expensive than other parts of the island.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $20-40 | Basic rooms with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $80-150 | Comfortable rooms with private bathrooms and amenities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $200-400 | High-end rooms and suites with luxury amenities |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $400-800 | City center, 1-bedroom apartment, utilities not included |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $250-500 | Outside city center, 1-bedroom apartment, utilities not included |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-60 |\n| Fine Dining | $60-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $3-5 |\n| Coffee | $2-4 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-2 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 400 | 600 | 1000 |\n| Food | 300 | 500 | 800 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 150 | 250 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 300 | 500 |\n| **Total** | **1100** | **1850** | **2850** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in a self-catering apartment or house to reduce food costs\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to save on transport costs\n- Eat at local markets or food stalls to try traditional cuisine at lower prices\n- Avoid traveling during peak season (December to April) to save on accommodations and flights\n- Learn some basic French phrases to negotiate prices and interact with locals\n- Take advantage of free activities, such as visiting the island's beautiful beaches or exploring the capital city's markets and historic sites",
