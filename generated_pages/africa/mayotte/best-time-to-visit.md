[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Mayotte, an overseas department of France located in the Indian Ocean, has a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by two main seasons: a dry season and a wet season. The dry season, which runs from April to October, is the best time to visit Mayotte, with pleasant weather, low humidity, and minimal risk of cyclones. During this period, the average temperature ranges from 24°C to 28°C, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and hiking. In contrast, the wet season, which runs from November to March, is marked by heavy rainfall, high humidity, and a higher risk of cyclones, making it less suitable for travel.

The climate in Mayotte is also influenced by its geographical location, with the island being surrounded by coral reefs and having a rugged terrain. The dry season is characterized by a southeast trade wind, which brings dry air from the Antarctic region, while the wet season is marked by a northwest monsoon wind, which brings warm, humid air from the equatorial region. Understanding the seasons and their effects on travel is essential to planning a successful trip to Mayotte.

The seasons in Mayotte also affect the availability of certain activities and attractions. For example, during the dry season, the waters are calmer, making it ideal for snorkeling and diving, while during the wet season, the rough seas and strong currents make these activities more challenging. Additionally, the wet season is the best time for birdwatching, as many species of birds migrate to the island during this period.
