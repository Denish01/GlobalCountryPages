Mayotte's healthcare system is based on the French model, with a universal healthcare system that provides comprehensive coverage to all residents, including foreigners who have obtained a residence permit. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment, but it can be slow and bureaucratic. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers more personalized and prompt care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare due to language barriers and the desire for more personalized care. Having health insurance is recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the costs of private healthcare and provide access to better facilities and services.

The healthcare system in Mayotte is generally well-organized, with a network of public hospitals, clinics, and health centers that provide a wide range of medical services. However, the system can be slow, and wait times can be long, especially for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer more prompt and personalized care, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it's often recommended to have private health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare and to provide access to better facilities and services.
