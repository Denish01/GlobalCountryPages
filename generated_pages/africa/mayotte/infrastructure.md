[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Mayotte's infrastructure development is driven by its status as an overseas territory of France, with significant investments in recent years to upgrade its roads, energy production, and telecommunications. The territory's infrastructure is generally more developed in urban areas, such as the capital Mamoudzou, compared to rural areas, where access to basic services like electricity, water, and sanitation can be limited. Despite these challenges, Mayotte's infrastructure is considered to be in relatively good condition compared to other islands in the region.

The French government has invested heavily in Mayotte's infrastructure, with a focus on improving the territory's connectivity and economic development. This includes investments in the road network, which has been significantly upgraded in recent years, as well as the development of a new port and airport facilities. However, the territory still faces significant challenges in providing access to clean water and sanitation, particularly in rural areas, where many households rely on traditional wells and latrines.

Mayotte's infrastructure development is also influenced by its geographic location, with the territory being prone to natural disasters such as cyclones and floods. As a result, there is a need for infrastructure that is resilient to these events, and that can provide essential services such as electricity, water, and telecommunications in the aftermath of a disaster.
