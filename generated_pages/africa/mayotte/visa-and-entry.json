[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nMayotte has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of around 80 countries eligible for visa-free access, including all European Union member states, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Citizens of these countries can stay in Mayotte for up to 90 days without a visa, as long as their passport is valid for at least six months beyond their intended stay. However, citizens of other countries, including many African and Asian nations, will need to obtain a visa before arriving in Mayotte.\n\nThe visa policy for Mayotte is largely aligned with that of France, and the island's authorities follow the same guidelines and requirements as the French government. This means that citizens of countries that require a visa for France will also need a visa for Mayotte. It's essential to note that even if you don't need a visa to enter Mayotte, you may still need to meet certain requirements, such as having a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds for your stay.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport or ID card |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online before arrival |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Visa required | 30 days | Must apply at a French embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Mayotte visa-free if they are citizens of an eligible country, and can stay for up to 90 days.
