[SECTION] What Is Mayotte? [/SECTION]
Mayotte is an overseas department and region of France located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa. It is part of the Comoro Islands archipelago, but unlike the other islands, it chose to remain a French territory in 1975. Mayotte is known for its beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and diverse marine life, making it a popular destination for tourists and scuba divers. The island has a tropical monsoon climate, with two main seasons: a hot and humid season from November to April, and a cooler and drier season from May to October.

Mayotte's geographic position makes it a strategic location for trade and commerce in the region. The island's economy is primarily based on agriculture, with major crops including vanilla, coffee, and coconuts. However, the tourism industry is growing, and the island's natural beauty and unique culture make it an attractive destination for visitors. Mayotte is also home to a diverse population, with a mix of African, Arab, and French influences.

The island's sovereignty status is unique, as it is an overseas department and region of France, but it also has a degree of autonomy. Mayotte has its own local government, but it is also represented in the French National Assembly and Senate. This status allows Mayotte to maintain its cultural identity while also benefiting from French citizenship and economic support.
