  "content": "The official language of Mayotte is **French**, which is widely spoken by the majority of the population, and visitors can get by with basic French phrases, although some locals may also speak other languages such as Shimaore, a Bantu language.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): French\nWidely Spoken: Shimaore, Kibushi\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Mayotte is characterized by the dominance of French, which is the language used in government, education, and media. However, many locals also speak Shimaore, a Bantu language that is closely related to the languages spoken in the Comoros Islands. Kibushi, a Malagasy language, is also spoken by some people, particularly in the northern part of the island. English is not widely spoken, and visitors may find it difficult to communicate with locals who do not speak French. Despite this, many younger people and those in the tourism industry may have some knowledge of English.\n\nThe regional dialects of Mayotte are influenced by the island's history and cultural ties to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Shimaore, for example, has been influenced by Arabic and French, and is spoken with a distinct accent and vocabulary. Kibushi, on the other hand, is more closely related to the languages spoken in Madagascar, and is spoken by people who have ancestral ties to the island.\n\nMinority languages are also spoken in Mayotte, including Malagasy and Makonde, which are spoken by people who have migrated to the island from other parts of Africa. However, French remains the dominant language, and is widely used in all aspects of life, including government, education, and commerce.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Bonjour | bone-JOOR | formal |\n| Hello | Salut | sah-LOO | informal |\n| Thank you | Merci | mur-SEE | formal |\n| Please | S'il vous plaît | see voo play | formal |\n| Yes / No | Oui / Non | wee / nohn | formal |\n| Excuse me | Excusez-moi | ex-KOO-zay mwah | formal |\n| How much? | Combien ça coûte? | kohm-byehn sah koot | formal |\n| Where is...? | Où est...? | oo eh | formal |\n| I don't understand | Je ne comprends pas | zhuh nuh kohm-prehn pah | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Parlez-vous anglais? | pahrl-ay voo ahng-lee | formal |\n| Help! | Au secours! | oh sek-oor | formal |\n| Goodbye | Au revoir | oh reh-vwahr | formal |\n| Sorry | Excusez-moi | ex-KOO-zay mwah | formal |\n| How are you? | Comment allez-vous? | koh-mohn tah-lay voo | formal |\n| What's your name? | Comment vous appelez-vous? | koh-mohn voo ah-play voo | formal |\n| I'm lost | Je suis perdu | zhuh swee pehr-doo | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Un | uhng |\n| 2 | Deux | duhr |\n| 3 | Trois | twah |\n| 4 | Quatre | kah-tray |\n| 5 | Cinq | sank |\n| 6 | Six | see |\n| 7 | Sept | seh |\n| 8 | Huit | wee |\n| 9 | Neuf | nuhf |\n| 10 | Dix | dee |\n| 100 | Cent | sahnt |\n| 1000 | Mille | meel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when communicating with locals, using formal language and titles such as \"monsieur\" or \"madame\".\n- Learn some basic French phrases, such as \"bonjour\" and \"merci\", to show appreciation for the local culture.\n- Avoid using gestures or body language that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the left hand or touching someone's head.\n- Use a formal tone when speaking to older people or those in positions of authority.\n- Be patient and try to understand the local accent and dialect, which may be different from standard French.\n- Don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification if you don't understand something.\n- Learn about the local customs and traditions, such as the importance of respect for elders and the role of Islam in the community.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a language course or use online resources to learn basic French phrases before traveling to Mayotte.\n- Use a local guide or tour operator to help with communication and navigation.\n- Learn about the local culture and customs to avoid unintentionally offending someone.",
