[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Mayotte, an overseas department of France, has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most residents relying on personal vehicles or taxis to get around. The main transportation modes in Mayotte include buses, taxis, and car rentals, with bicycles and walking also being popular options in smaller towns and villages. The quality of public transit is limited, with infrequent bus services and no metro or subway system, making it challenging for visitors to navigate the island without a car.

The majority of people in Mayotte get around by car, with many residents owning their own vehicles due to the lack of reliable public transportation. Taxis are also widely available, but can be more expensive than in other parts of the world. For shorter distances, bicycles and walking are good options, especially in the capital city of Mamoudzou, where the terrain is relatively flat and the climate is warm. However, for longer distances or traveling to more remote areas, a car or taxi is often necessary.
