However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand during the summer months. The **French** government, which oversees the territory, has implemented measures to stabilize prices and ensure a reliable supply of energy and water. Despite these efforts, residents may still experience occasional power outages and water shortages, particularly during periods of high demand.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Mayotte is generally higher than in other parts of Africa, due to the territory's remote location and reliance on imported fuel. However, the **French** government has implemented subsidies and other measures to help reduce the burden of utility costs on low-income households. As a result, the cost of utilities in Mayotte is relatively stable, with minimal fluctuations from year to year. It's worth noting that the cost of utilities can vary depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have higher costs than rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | SFR, Orange |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-80 | 50-100 Mbps | SFR, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | SFR, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 5-10 GB | SFR, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-120 | varies | SFR, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Mayotte, residents typically need to provide proof of identity and address, as well as a security deposit.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans are generally more cost-effective for heavy users.\n- The best internet providers in Mayotte are SFR and Orange, which offer a range of plans and bundles.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and taking advantage of subsidies and discounts offered by the government. \n- It's also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure you're getting the best deal for your needs and budget.",
