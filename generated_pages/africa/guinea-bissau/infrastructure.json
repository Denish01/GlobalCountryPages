  "content": "The infrastructure in Guinea-Bissau is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, with limited access to electricity, water, and sanitation, as well as a lack of investment in transportation networks. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 30% of population\nInternet Penetration: 3%\nRoad Network: 3,455 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nGuinea-Bissau's infrastructure is characterized by a significant urban-rural gap, with the capital city Bissau having relatively better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, while rural areas are often left behind. The country's infrastructure development has been hindered by years of instability, corruption, and lack of investment. Recent years have seen some efforts to improve the situation, with international organizations and donors providing funding for infrastructure projects, including road construction and energy generation. However, much remains to be done to address the country's significant infrastructure deficits.\n\nThe government of Guinea-Bissau has recognized the need to invest in infrastructure to drive economic growth and improve living standards. As a result, there have been efforts to increase investment in key sectors such as energy, transportation, and water. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of capacity and resources to maintain and manage its infrastructure. The urban-rural gap in infrastructure access is a major concern, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.\n\nThe development of Guinea-Bissau's infrastructure is also hindered by the country's limited financial resources and its dependence on international aid. The government has been working to increase its revenue base and reduce its dependence on external assistance, but this is a long-term process that will require sustained efforts and commitment. In the meantime, the country will continue to rely on international organizations and donors to support its infrastructure development efforts.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 3,455 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved, limited maintenance |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in the country |\n| Airports | 2 international, 1 domestic | Moderate | Limited facilities and services |\n| Ports | 1 major | Poor | Limited capacity and equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\nThe transportation network in Guinea-Bissau is limited and in poor condition, with most roads being unpaved and lacking regular maintenance. The country has no rail network, and its airports and ports have limited facilities and services. The road network is the primary mode of transportation, but it is often in disrepair, making it difficult and time-consuming to travel around the country. The lack of investment in transportation infrastructure has hindered the country's economic development and limited its ability to connect with regional and international markets.\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of power generation in Guinea-Bissau is **thermal energy**, with most of the country's electricity being generated from diesel-powered plants.\n- The country's energy sector is characterized by frequent **power outages**, which can last for several hours or even days.\n- The government has been working to increase the use of **renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.\n- The electricity grid is limited, with only about 30% of the population having access to electricity, mostly in urban areas.\n- The country has significant potential for **hydroelectric power** generation, but this has not been fully exploited due to lack of investment and capacity.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **safe drinking water** is limited, with only about 50% of the population having access to improved water sources.\n- The country's **sanitation coverage** is also limited, with only about 20% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- The lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is a major public health concern, with many people suffering from water-borne diseases.\n- The government has been working to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, particularly in rural areas.\n- The country has significant potential for **irrigation** development, but this has not been fully exploited due to lack of investment and capacity.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- The country has a relatively **low level of internet penetration**, with only about 3% of the population having access to the internet.\n- The **mobile phone network** is more developed, with about 50% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- The government has been working to increase access to telecommunications services, particularly in rural areas.\n- The country has significant potential for **e-commerce** and **digital economy** development, but this has not been fully exploited due to lack of investment and capacity.\n- The **postal service** is limited, with only a few post offices operating in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a number of **infrastructure development projects**, including road construction and energy generation, with funding from international organizations and donors.\n- The **World Bank** has provided funding for a number of infrastructure projects in the country, including a road construction project and an energy generation project.\n- The **African Development Bank** has also provided funding for infrastructure projects in the country, including a water and sanitation project.\n- The government has also been working to increase **private sector investment** in infrastructure development, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors.\n- The country has significant potential for **regional integration**, particularly through the **Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)**, but this has not been fully exploited due to lack of investment and capacity.",
