  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Guinea-Bissau can vary significantly depending on the type of care and whether you choose public or private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $82.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $82 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 61.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau is a mixed system, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are better equipped and staffed, but are often expensive and out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, private healthcare facilities are generally the best option, as they offer higher quality care and are more likely to have English-speaking staff. However, it is still recommended to have health insurance, as medical costs can be high and evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of a serious medical emergency.\n\nThe healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau is not well-developed, and medical facilities and personnel are often in short supply. As a result, many people rely on traditional medicine and home remedies, particularly in rural areas. For those who can afford it, private healthcare facilities offer a higher level of care, but these facilities are often concentrated in urban areas, such as the capital city of Bissau. For foreigners, it is essential to research and identify reliable private healthcare facilities before arriving in the country, and to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Limited specialist services available |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Basic dental care only |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$30 | Limited eye care services available |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by lab and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Limited emergency services available |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$50 | Basic care only |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Limited surgical services available |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$200 | Limited maternity services available |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Limited availability, often requires travel to another country |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Basic imaging services only |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Basic medical care, limited coverage |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Private hospital care, specialist services, evacuation coverage |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Comprehensive global coverage, evacuation to home country |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** are widely available at pharmacies, with prices ranging from $5-$20.\n- **Prescription medications** are often in short supply, and may require a visit to a private clinic or hospital to obtain.\n- Pharmacy availability is limited in rural areas, and many people rely on traditional medicine and home remedies.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but quality and authenticity can vary.\n- Prescription rules are often lax, and many medications are available without a prescription.\n- Medication prices can vary significantly depending on the location and availability of the medication.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 112, or to seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic. However, emergency services are often limited, and medical facilities may not have the necessary equipment or personnel to handle serious medical situations. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including evacuation to another country if necessary. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private facilities, such as the **Hospital Simão Mendes** in Bissau, which offer higher quality care and are more likely to have English-speaking staff. However, even at these facilities, medical resources and equipment may be limited, and evacuation to another country may still be necessary in case of a serious medical emergency.",
