However, the demand for housing is high, driven by a growing population and an influx of expatriates and international organizations. Typical lease terms in Guinea-Bissau range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally not well-protected, and disputes over rent and eviction are common. Compared to its regional neighbors, Guinea-Bissau's housing costs are relatively low, especially when compared to Senegal, where the cost of living is significantly higher.\n\nThe housing market in Guinea-Bissau is also characterized by a lack of formal housing options, with many residents living in informal settlements or traditional compounds. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the development of new housing projects, particularly in the capital city, which has led to an increase in the availability of modern and well-maintained apartments. Despite this, the housing market in Guinea-Bissau remains largely unregulated, and renters should be cautious when signing a lease agreement and ensure that they understand their rights and responsibilities.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $100-$150 | $60-$100 | basic amenities, shared bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $150-$250 | $80-$150 | furnished, modern appliances |\n| 2 Bedroom | $250-$400 | $150-$250 | family size, air conditioning |\n| 3 Bedroom | $400-$600 | $250-$400 | spacious, modern finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, traditional houses |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | traditional compounds, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Bairro de Ajuda**: a upscale neighborhood in the heart of Bissau, with modern apartments and a range of amenities, rent range $200-$500 per month\n- **Bairro de Penha**: a coastal neighborhood with stunning views of the ocean, rent range $150-$300 per month\n- **Bairro de Kumun**: a residential neighborhood with a mix of traditional and modern houses, rent range $100-$250 per month\n- **Quinara**: a rural town with a range of traditional compounds and modern houses, rent range $50-$150 per month\n- **Cacheu**: a coastal town with a range of apartments and houses, rent range $100-$250 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Guinea-Bissau [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable apartment\n- Inspect the apartment carefully before signing a lease agreement and ensure that all necessary repairs are made\n- Negotiate the rent and deposit requirements, as these can often be flexible\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that the landlord or agent is legitimate\n- Utilities such as electricity and water are usually not included in the rent, and tenants should budget for these expenses\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished apartments can also be found, especially in traditional compounds",
