  "content": "To get around in Guinea-Bissau, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services, although the transportation infrastructure is generally underdeveloped and limited.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Osvaldo Vieira International Airport (OXB)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe main international airport in Guinea-Bissau is Osvaldo Vieira International Airport, located in Bissau, which receives flights from major West African cities like Dakar, Senegal, and Conakry, Guinea. There are no direct flights from Europe or the Americas, so travelers often have to connect through a hub like Lisbon, Portugal, or Casablanca, Morocco. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from Senegal and Guinea, although this can be a challenging and time-consuming option due to the poor road conditions and potential bureaucratic delays.\n\nFor overland travel, the most common entry points are the border crossings at São Domingos, from Senegal, and at Boé, from Guinea. These routes can be rough, especially during the rainy season, and may require a 4x4 vehicle or a robust taxi. Additionally, be prepared for potential delays and harassment from border officials, and make sure to have all necessary documents, including a valid passport, visa, and car insurance, if driving.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic flights in Guinea-Bissau are limited, with only a few airlines operating routes between Bissau and other major cities like Bafatá, Gabú, and Catió. The main domestic airline is Transportes Aéreos de Guinea-Bissau, which offers scheduled flights, although the frequency and reliability can be unpredictable. Booking in advance is essential, and it's recommended to check with the airline or a local travel agency for the latest schedules and prices. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $200, depending on the route and availability.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in Guinea-Bissau, so train travel is not an option. The country's transportation infrastructure is focused on roads and air travel, with limited investment in rail or other modes of transportation. As a result, travelers must rely on buses, taxis, or domestic flights to get around the country.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus companies in Guinea-Bissau operate on a limited schedule, with routes connecting major cities like Bissau, Bafatá, and Gabú. The buses are often overcrowded and uncomfortable, and the journey can be slow due to the poor road conditions. However, this is a relatively affordable option, with prices ranging from $5 to $20, depending on the route and distance. It's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, and to be prepared for delays and potential breakdowns.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Bissau | $0.50 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $5-10 | Negotiate the price before departure |\n| Ride-Hailing | Bissau | $5-10 | Local alternatives like Allo Taxi |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Bissau | $2-5 | Limited availability, mostly in the capital |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Guinea-Bissau, you'll need a valid international driver's license, and it's recommended to obtain a local license if you plan to stay for an extended period.\n- Road conditions are generally poor, with many roads unpaved and prone to flooding during the rainy season.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, and availability can be limited outside of major cities.\n- Car rental options are limited, and it's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n- Hazards on the road include potholes, livestock, and aggressive drivers, so it's essential to drive defensively and cautiously.\n- If you plan to drive, consider hiring a local driver or guide who is familiar with the roads and conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be prepared for delays and potential breakdowns when using public transportation, and consider hiring a private vehicle or driver for more flexibility.\n- Always negotiate the price before departing, whether you're using a taxi or a ride-hailing service.\n- Be aware of potential scams, such as overcharging or fake taxis, and use reputable companies or local recommendations.\n- Download local apps like Allo Taxi or use online platforms to book transportation in advance.\n- Keep your valuables secure, especially in crowded areas or public transportation, and be mindful of your surroundings.\n- Learn some basic Portuguese phrases, such as \" quanto custa?\" (how much does it cost?), to help you navigate transportation options.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or joining a tour group to help you navigate the country's transportation challenges and make the most of your trip.",
