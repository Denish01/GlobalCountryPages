# Guinea-Bissau Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Guinea-Bissau's culture is a unique blend of African, Portuguese, and Islamic influences. The country has a diverse ethnic makeup, with over 20 different ethnic groups, including the **Fula**, **Mandinka**, and **Balanta**. The official language is Portuguese, but many locals also speak **Crioulo**, a Creole language that is widely used in everyday life. The country's cultural identity is also shaped by its history as a Portuguese colony, which has left a lasting legacy in terms of architecture, cuisine, and customs.

The cultural landscape of Guinea-Bissau is characterized by a strong sense of community and tradition. Many people live in rural areas, where they engage in subsistence farming and fishing. The country's coastal location and tropical climate also make it an important center for trade and commerce. The cultural influence of Islam is also significant, with many Muslims living in the country. The **Djola** and **Papel** ethnic groups, for example, are predominantly Muslim, and their cultural practices and traditions reflect this.

Despite its cultural diversity, Guinea-Bissau is a country with a strong sense of national identity. The country's struggle for independence from Portugal is still celebrated today, and the national flag and anthem are important symbols of national pride. The **National Liberation Front of Guinea and Cape Verde** (FRELIMO) played a key role in the country's independence movement, and its legacy continues to shape the country's politics and culture today.
