[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Guinea-Bissau are generally lower compared to the regional average, with the country's **inflation rate** of 3.8% in 2024 contributing to relatively stable prices. However, the cost of food can be driven up by factors such as **transportation costs**, which can be high due to the country's limited infrastructure, and **seasonal fluctuations** in the availability of certain ingredients. Eating out is not as common in Guinea-Bissau as home cooking, with many locals preferring to prepare their own meals using traditional ingredients and recipes. This is partly due to the fact that eating out can be more expensive, with meals at mid-range restaurants starting from around $10 USD per person.

In general, the cost of food in Guinea-Bissau is influenced by a range of factors, including the country's **GDP per capita PPP** of $3,119, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. This can make it challenging for locals to afford certain types of food, particularly imported goods. However, the country's **local markets** offer a wide range of fresh produce and traditional ingredients at competitive prices, making it possible for people to access affordable and nutritious food.
