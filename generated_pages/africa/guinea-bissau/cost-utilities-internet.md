[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Guinea-Bissau is still developing, and the quality of services can vary depending on the location. In general, the cost of utilities in Guinea-Bissau is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The costs are also subject to fluctuation due to factors such as fuel prices, government subsidies, and seasonal variation. For example, during the dry season, the cost of water and electricity may increase due to higher demand and lower supply.

The stability of utility costs in Guinea-Bissau is also a concern, as the country is prone to power outages and water shortages. However, the government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the introduction of new power plants and water treatment facilities. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities is still a significant burden for many households, and the lack of stable and reliable services can be a challenge for businesses and individuals alike.
