[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Guinea-Bissau has a tropical **savanna climate**, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from November to May, is characterized by dry and comfortable weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F). This is the best time to visit Guinea-Bissau, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as **hiking**, **birdwatching**, and **wildlife spotting**. The wet season, which runs from June to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it more challenging to travel and engage in outdoor activities.

The seasons in Guinea-Bissau have a significant impact on travel, as the wet season can make roads impassable and increase the risk of **malaria** and other diseases. During the dry season, the roads are more accessible, and the weather is more comfortable, making it easier to explore the country's **national parks**, **beaches**, and **cultural attractions**. However, the dry season is also the peak tourist season, which means that prices for accommodations and tourist services may be higher.

The climate in Guinea-Bissau varies by region, with the coastal areas tend to be more humid and hot than the interior regions. The **Fouta Djallon highlands**, located in the northeast of the country, have a cooler climate than the rest of the country, making them a popular destination for **trekking** and **hiking**.
