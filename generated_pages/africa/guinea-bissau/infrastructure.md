[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Guinea-Bissau's infrastructure is characterized by a significant urban-rural gap, with the capital city Bissau having relatively better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, while rural areas are often left behind. The country's infrastructure development has been hindered by years of instability, corruption, and lack of investment. Recent years have seen some efforts to improve the situation, with international organizations and donors providing funding for infrastructure projects, including road construction and energy generation. However, much remains to be done to address the country's significant infrastructure deficits.

The government of Guinea-Bissau has recognized the need to invest in infrastructure to drive economic growth and improve living standards. As a result, there have been efforts to increase investment in key sectors such as energy, transportation, and water. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of capacity and resources to maintain and manage its infrastructure. The urban-rural gap in infrastructure access is a major concern, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.

The development of Guinea-Bissau's infrastructure is also hindered by the country's limited financial resources and its dependence on international aid. The government has been working to increase its revenue base and reduce its dependence on external assistance, but this is a long-term process that will require sustained efforts and commitment. In the meantime, the country will continue to rely on international organizations and donors to support its infrastructure development efforts.

[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]
[TABLE]
| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roads | 3,455 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved, limited maintenance |
| Railways | none | - | No rail network in the country |
| Airports | 2 international, 1 domestic | Moderate | Limited facilities and services |
| Ports | 1 major | Poor | Limited capacity and equipment |
[/TABLE]

The transportation network in Guinea-Bissau is limited and in poor condition, with most roads being unpaved and lacking regular maintenance. The country has no rail network, and its airports and ports have limited facilities and services. The road network is the primary mode of transportation, but it is often in disrepair, making it difficult and time-consuming to travel around the country. The lack of investment in transportation infrastructure has hindered the country's economic development and limited its ability to connect with regional and international markets.
