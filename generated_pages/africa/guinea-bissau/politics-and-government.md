[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Guinea-Bissau is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and serves as the head of state, while the Prime Minister is appointed by the President and is responsible for overseeing the government. The National People's Assembly, the country's unicameral legislature, is composed of 102 members who are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The system is designed to provide checks and balances between the different branches of government, ensuring that no single branch has too much power.

The **semi-presidential system** in Guinea-Bissau is intended to promote stability and accountability, as the President and Prime Minister are both responsible for the government's actions. However, the system has been criticized for being prone to political instability, as the President and Prime Minister may have different priorities and interests. Despite these challenges, the government of Guinea-Bissau has made efforts to promote **democratic governance** and respect for human rights.

Guinea-Bissau is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government that has authority over the entire country. The government is divided into eight regions, each with its own governor and administration. However, the regions have limited autonomy, and the central government has significant control over regional affairs.
