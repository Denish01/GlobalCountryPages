  "content": "Healthcare in Guinea-Bissau is a mixed system that faces significant challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of trained medical professionals. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Basic\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering services. However, the public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country. The quality of care varies significantly, with urban areas generally having better access to healthcare services than rural areas. In rural areas, healthcare services are often limited, and people may have to travel long distances to access basic medical care. The country also faces a shortage of trained medical professionals, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country to work abroad.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau is underfunded and understaffed, which can result in long waiting times, inadequate equipment, and a lack of essential medications. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality care, but their services are often expensive and inaccessible to the majority of the population. As a result, many people in Guinea-Bissau rely on traditional medicine and self-medication, which can be ineffective and even dangerous. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities.\n\nDespite these efforts, the healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of trained medical professionals. The country also faces a high burden of infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, which can put a significant strain on the healthcare system. To address these challenges, the government and international organizations are working together to strengthen the healthcare system, improve access to healthcare services, and reduce the burden of infectious diseases.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital Nacional Simão Mendes | Bissau | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Privada Bissau | Bissau | Private | General medicine, cardiology, dermatology | Moderate |\n| Hopital Regional de Gabu | Gabu | Public | General medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Sao Joao | Bissau | Private | General medicine, orthopedics, ophthalmology | Moderate |\n| Hospital Regional de Bafata | Bafata | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Mediterranee | Bissau | Private | General medicine, cardiology, gastroenterology | Moderate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it can provide access to better quality care and more comprehensive coverage.\n- Local insurance options are available, but they may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** plans are available, which can provide coverage for medical expenses, evacuation, and repatriation.\n- The cost of health insurance in Guinea-Bissau can vary significantly, depending on the type of coverage and the provider.\n- It is essential to carefully review the terms and conditions of any health insurance plan before purchasing it.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are available in Guinea-Bissau, but the selection may be limited, and the quality of some medications may be questionable.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- Common brands of medications are available, but generic versions may be more widely available.\n- The cost of medications in Guinea-Bissau can vary significantly, depending on the type and quality of the medication.\n- It is essential to consult a qualified healthcare professional before taking any medication, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for all travelers to Guinea-Bissau.\n- **Malaria prophylaxis** is recommended, as malaria is a significant health risk in the country.\n- **Hepatitis A and B vaccinations** are recommended, as these diseases are prevalent in the country.\n- **Typhoid vaccination** is recommended, especially for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Rabies vaccination** is recommended, especially for travelers who will be spending time around animals.\n- **Waterborne diseases**, such as cholera and dysentery, are a significant health risk in Guinea-Bissau, and travelers should take precautions to avoid contaminated water and food.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Medical tourism is not a significant industry in Guinea-Bissau, due to the limited availability of specialized medical services.\n- However, some private clinics and hospitals in Bissau may offer specialized services, such as orthopedic surgery or cardiology.\n- The cost of medical procedures in Guinea-Bissau can be lower than in some other countries, but the quality of care may vary significantly.\n- It is essential to carefully research any medical facility or provider before seeking treatment, especially if you are considering traveling to Guinea-Bissau for medical tourism.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 112, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance services** are limited, and it may be necessary to use a taxi or private vehicle to transport a patient to the hospital.\n- The nearest hospital or clinic may not have the necessary equipment or staff to provide adequate care, and evacuation to a neighboring country or Europe may be necessary.\n- It is essential to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including access to a reliable means of transportation and communication.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, and it is essential to carefully review the terms and conditions of your insurance policy before seeking treatment.",
