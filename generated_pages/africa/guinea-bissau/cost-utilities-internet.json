In general, the cost of utilities in Guinea-Bissau is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The costs are also subject to fluctuation due to factors such as fuel prices, government subsidies, and seasonal variation. For example, during the dry season, the cost of water and electricity may increase due to higher demand and lower supply.\n\nThe stability of utility costs in Guinea-Bissau is also a concern, as the country is prone to power outages and water shortages. However, the government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the introduction of new power plants and water treatment facilities. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities is still a significant burden for many households, and the lack of stable and reliable services can be a challenge for businesses and individuals alike.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $15 | $25 | $35 | includes sewage and garbage collection |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | mostly used for cooking |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$60** | **$100** | **$140** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Orange, MTN |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 60 Mbps | Orange, MTN |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Orange, MTN, Guinetel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Orange, MTN, Guinetel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Orange, MTN |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in English, French, and Portuguese |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in English, French, and Portuguese |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Guinean music and movies |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as Electricidade e Agua da Guiné-Bissau (EAGB) for electricity and water, and Orange or MTN for internet and phone services.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget their energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Guinea-Bissau are Orange and MTN, which offer a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, reducing water consumption, and using prepaid meters to monitor their energy usage.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts or bundles.",
