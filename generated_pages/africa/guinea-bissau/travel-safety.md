[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Guinea-Bissau is a relatively unstable country with a high risk of petty and violent crime. The country has experienced periods of civil unrest, and the security situation can be unpredictable. Visitors should exercise extreme caution, especially at night, and avoid traveling alone or displaying signs of wealth. The lack of infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, can also pose challenges for travelers. However, with proper planning and precautions, it is possible to have a safe and rewarding experience in Guinea-Bissau.

The country's economy is largely based on agriculture, and the capital city of Bissau is a bustling hub of activity. However, the city is also plagued by crime, including pickpocketing, mugging, and armed robbery. The police presence is limited, and the emergency services are not always reliable. Despite these challenges, many travelers visit Guinea-Bissau each year without incident, and the country has a rich cultural heritage and natural beauty to offer. With the right mindset and precautions, visitors can navigate the country's safety challenges and have a positive experience.
