[SECTION] Overview: Guinea-Bissau vs Senegal [/SECTION]
Guinea-Bissau and Senegal are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Guinea-Bissau has a smaller economy and a lower GDP per capita, which contributes to its lower cost of living. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with a focus on cashew nut production, while Senegal has a more diversified economy with a strong service sector. As a result, Guinea-Bissau tends to be more affordable for expats and travelers, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.

In terms of overall cost of living, Guinea-Bissau is around 15-20% cheaper than Senegal, making it an attractive option for those looking to stretch their budget. However, it's essential to note that both countries have unique characteristics and advantages, and the cost of living can vary depending on individual lifestyle and preferences. For example, Senegal has a more developed tourist infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which may justify the higher costs for some visitors.
