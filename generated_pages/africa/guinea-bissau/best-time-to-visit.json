The dry season, which runs from November to May, is characterized by dry and comfortable weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F). This is the best time to visit Guinea-Bissau, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as **hiking**, **birdwatching**, and **wildlife spotting**.
