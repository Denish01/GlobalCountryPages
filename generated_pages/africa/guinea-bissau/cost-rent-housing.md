[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Guinea-Bissau is relatively underdeveloped, with a limited supply of modern and well-maintained apartments, especially in the capital city of Bissau. However, the demand for housing is high, driven by a growing population and an influx of expatriates and international organizations. Typical lease terms in Guinea-Bissau range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally not well-protected, and disputes over rent and eviction are common. Compared to its regional neighbors, Guinea-Bissau's housing costs are relatively low, especially when compared to Senegal, where the cost of living is significantly higher.

The housing market in Guinea-Bissau is also characterized by a lack of formal housing options, with many residents living in informal settlements or traditional compounds. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the development of new housing projects, particularly in the capital city, which has led to an increase in the availability of modern and well-maintained apartments. Despite this, the housing market in Guinea-Bissau remains largely unregulated, and renters should be cautious when signing a lease agreement and ensure that they understand their rights and responsibilities.
