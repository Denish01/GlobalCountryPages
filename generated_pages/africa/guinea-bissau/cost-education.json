The language of instruction is **Portuguese**, which can be a barrier for some students. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from ages 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are available in the capital city of Bissau, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **British Curriculum**.\n\nThe education system in Guinea-Bissau faces several challenges, including a lack of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the education system, with a focus on increasing access to education, particularly for girls and rural communities.
