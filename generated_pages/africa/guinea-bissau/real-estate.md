The property market in Guinea-Bissau is characterized by a lack of infrastructure and limited availability of modern housing, particularly outside of the capital city, Bissau. Despite these challenges, the market is showing signs of growth, driven by increasing demand for housing and commercial properties. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with prices remaining relatively low compared to other countries in the region. However, the market is expected to grow in the coming years, driven by government initiatives to attract foreign investment and improve the business climate. The urban areas, particularly Bissau, are experiencing a surge in demand for housing and commercial properties, while the rural areas are largely underserved.

The price trajectory of the property market in Guinea-Bissau is expected to increase in the coming years, driven by growing demand and limited supply. The government has implemented policies to attract foreign investment, including the creation of a **free trade zone** and the establishment of a **one-stop shop** for investors.
