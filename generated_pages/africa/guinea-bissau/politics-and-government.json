  "content": "Guinea-Bissau is governed as a **semi-presidential republic**, with a system that combines elements of presidential and parliamentary systems, where the President serves as the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Semi-Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President Umaro Sissoco Embaló\nHead of Government: Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam\nLegislature: National People's Assembly, unicameral, 102 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: 0.64 (low), ranked 143 out of 178 countries\nCorruption Index: 81 out of 180 countries (Transparency International ranking 2021)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Guinea-Bissau is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and serves as the head of state, while the Prime Minister is appointed by the President and is responsible for overseeing the government. The National People's Assembly, the country's unicameral legislature, is composed of 102 members who are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The system is designed to provide checks and balances between the different branches of government, ensuring that no single branch has too much power.\n\nThe **semi-presidential system** in Guinea-Bissau is intended to promote stability and accountability, as the President and Prime Minister are both responsible for the government's actions.
