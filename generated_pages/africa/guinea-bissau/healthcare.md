[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering services. However, the public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country. The quality of care varies significantly, with urban areas generally having better access to healthcare services than rural areas. In rural areas, healthcare services are often limited, and people may have to travel long distances to access basic medical care. The country also faces a shortage of trained medical professionals, with many doctors and nurses leaving the country to work abroad.

The public healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau is underfunded and understaffed, which can result in long waiting times, inadequate equipment, and a lack of essential medications. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality care, but their services are often expensive and inaccessible to the majority of the population. As a result, many people in Guinea-Bissau rely on traditional medicine and self-medication, which can be ineffective and even dangerous. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities.

Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau still faces significant challenges, including a lack of funding, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of trained medical professionals. The country also faces a high burden of infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, which can put a significant strain on the healthcare system. To address these challenges, the government and international organizations are working together to strengthen the healthcare system, improve access to healthcare services, and reduce the burden of infectious diseases.
