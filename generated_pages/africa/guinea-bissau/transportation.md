[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in Guinea-Bissau is Osvaldo Vieira International Airport, located in Bissau, which receives flights from major West African cities like Dakar, Senegal, and Conakry, Guinea. There are no direct flights from Europe or the Americas, so travelers often have to connect through a hub like Lisbon, Portugal, or Casablanca, Morocco. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from Senegal and Guinea, although this can be a challenging and time-consuming option due to the poor road conditions and potential bureaucratic delays.

For overland travel, the most common entry points are the border crossings at São Domingos, from Senegal, and at Boé, from Guinea. These routes can be rough, especially during the rainy season, and may require a 4x4 vehicle or a robust taxi. Additionally, be prepared for potential delays and harassment from border officials, and make sure to have all necessary documents, including a valid passport, visa, and car insurance, if driving.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in Guinea-Bissau are limited, with only a few airlines operating routes between Bissau and other major cities like Bafatá, Gabú, and Catió. The main domestic airline is Transportes Aéreos de Guinea-Bissau, which offers scheduled flights, although the frequency and reliability can be unpredictable. Booking in advance is essential, and it's recommended to check with the airline or a local travel agency for the latest schedules and prices. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $200, depending on the route and availability.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in Guinea-Bissau, so train travel is not an option. The country's transportation infrastructure is focused on roads and air travel, with limited investment in rail or other modes of transportation. As a result, travelers must rely on buses, taxis, or domestic flights to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus companies in Guinea-Bissau operate on a limited schedule, with routes connecting major cities like Bissau, Bafatá, and Gabú. The buses are often overcrowded and uncomfortable, and the journey can be slow due to the poor road conditions. However, this is a relatively affordable option, with prices ranging from $5 to $20, depending on the route and distance. It's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, and to be prepared for delays and potential breakdowns.

[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]
