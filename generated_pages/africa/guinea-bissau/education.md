[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Guinea-Bissau is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory, lasts for six years and is intended for children between the ages of 7 and 12. Secondary education, which is not compulsory, lasts for seven years and is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for four years, and the second cycle lasts for three years. Tertiary education is available at the **Universidade Amílcar Cabral**, which is the country's only public university, and a few private institutions. The quality of education in Guinea-Bissau is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure, such as classrooms, desks, and teaching materials. Public schools are generally underfunded and understaffed, while private schools are often expensive and inaccessible to most of the population.

The education system in Guinea-Bissau also faces challenges related to accessibility and equity. Many children, particularly girls and those living in rural areas, do not have access to education due to poverty, lack of infrastructure, and cultural barriers. The government has implemented policies to improve access to education, such as free primary education and scholarships for disadvantaged students. However, more needs to be done to address the systemic issues that prevent many children from accessing quality education.

Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the education system in Guinea-Bissau. The government has introduced reforms aimed at increasing access to education, improving teacher training, and enhancing the quality of education. International organizations, such as the **United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)** and the **World Bank**, are also providing support to the education sector in Guinea-Bissau.
