However, the cost of food can be driven up by factors such as **transportation costs**, which can be high due to the country's limited infrastructure, and **seasonal fluctuations** in the availability of certain ingredients. Eating out is not as common in Guinea-Bissau as home cooking, with many locals preferring to prepare their own meals using traditional ingredients and recipes. This is partly due to the fact that eating out can be more expensive, with meals at mid-range restaurants starting from around $10 USD per person.\n\nIn general, the cost of food in Guinea-Bissau is influenced by a range of factors, including the country's **GDP per capita PPP** of $3,119, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. This can make it challenging for locals to afford certain types of food, particularly imported goods. However, the country's **local markets** offer a wide range of fresh produce and traditional ingredients at competitive prices, making it possible for people to access affordable and nutritious food.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 900 XOF | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 750 XOF | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 1,200 XOF | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 600 XOF | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 2,100 XOF | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00 | 3,000 XOF | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50 | 1,500 XOF | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 900 XOF | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 600 XOF | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 480 XOF | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 2,400 XOF | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 600 XOF | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | (typical dishes such as rice and fish) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$30 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between **supermarkets** and **local markets** in Guinea-Bissau can be significant, with local markets often offering lower prices for fresh produce and traditional ingredients.
