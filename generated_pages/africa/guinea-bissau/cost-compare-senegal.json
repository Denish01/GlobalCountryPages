  "content": "Guinea-Bissau is generally cheaper than Senegal, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGuinea-Bissau GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,444\nSenegal GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,544\nGuinea-Bissau Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nSenegal Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Guinea-Bissau\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Guinea-Bissau vs Senegal [/SECTION]\nGuinea-Bissau and Senegal are two neighboring countries in West Africa, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living standards. Guinea-Bissau has a smaller economy and a lower GDP per capita, which contributes to its lower cost of living. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with a focus on cashew nut production, while Senegal has a more diversified economy with a strong service sector. As a result, Guinea-Bissau tends to be more affordable for expats and travelers, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.\n\nIn terms of overall cost of living, Guinea-Bissau is around 15-20% cheaper than Senegal, making it an attractive option for those looking to stretch their budget. However, it's essential to note that both countries have unique characteristics and advantages, and the cost of living can vary depending on individual lifestyle and preferences. For example, Senegal has a more developed tourist infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which may justify the higher costs for some visitors. On the other hand, Guinea-Bissau offers a more off-the-beaten-path experience, with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1.5 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Guinea-Bissau (USD) | Senegal (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Guinea-Bissau is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and accommodation\n- Food and dining\n- Transportation\n- Utilities and internet\n- **Senegal is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods and luxury items\n- High-end accommodations and tourist services\n- International flights and travel connections\n- Access to modern amenities and infrastructure\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and travelers looking for an affordable and off-the-beaten-path experience, Guinea-Bissau is likely the better choice.
