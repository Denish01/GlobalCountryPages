[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau is a mixed system, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are better equipped and staffed, but are often expensive and out of reach for many locals. For foreigners, private healthcare facilities are generally the best option, as they offer higher quality care and are more likely to have English-speaking staff. However, it is still recommended to have health insurance, as medical costs can be high and evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of a serious medical emergency.

The healthcare system in Guinea-Bissau is not well-developed, and medical facilities and personnel are often in short supply. As a result, many people rely on traditional medicine and home remedies, particularly in rural areas. For those who can afford it, private healthcare facilities offer a higher level of care, but these facilities are often concentrated in urban areas, such as the capital city of Bissau. For foreigners, it is essential to research and identify reliable private healthcare facilities before arriving in the country, and to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations.

In case of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 112, or to seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic. However, emergency services are often limited, and medical facilities may not have the necessary equipment or personnel to handle serious medical situations. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including evacuation to another country if necessary. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private facilities, such as the **Hospital Simão Mendes** in Bissau, which offer higher quality care and are more likely to have English-speaking staff. However, even at these facilities, medical resources and equipment may be limited, and evacuation to another country may still be necessary in case of a serious medical emergency.
