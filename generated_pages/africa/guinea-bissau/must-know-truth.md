# The Truth About Guinea-Bissau - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Guinea-Bissau is a **sovereign** country located in West Africa, with a rich and complex history. The area was first inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the **Balanta**, **Fula**, and **Mandinka**. In the 15th century, the Portuguese established trade relations with the local populations, and by the 19th century, the area had become a Portuguese **colony**. Guinea-Bissau was officially declared a Portuguese overseas territory in 1879. The country gained its independence from Portugal on September 10, 1974, after a long struggle led by the **African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde** (PAIGC).

The independence movement was marked by a series of key events, including the appointment of **Amílcar Cabral** as the leader of the PAIGC in 1963. Cabral played a crucial role in the fight for independence, and his leadership helped to galvanize the movement. However, he was assassinated in 1973, just a year before Guinea-Bissau gained its independence. After independence, the country faced significant challenges, including a fragile economy and a lack of infrastructure. In 1980, a military coup led by **João Bernardo "Nino" Vieira** overthrew the government, and Vieira ruled the country until 1999.

Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by periods of instability and conflict, including a **civil war** that lasted from 1998 to 1999. The war was sparked by a dispute between the government and a rebel group, and it resulted in significant damage to the country's infrastructure and economy. In 2005, Vieira was re-elected as president, but he was assassinated in 2009. Since then, the country has struggled to establish a stable government, with multiple coups and elections taking place.

The country's history has also been influenced by its geography, with the **Cacheu River** and the **Georgetown River** playing important roles in the country's trade and commerce. The capital city, **Bissau**, has been an important center of trade and commerce since the 15th century, and it remains a key hub of economic activity today.
