[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana has a well-developed transportation network, with various modes of transport available, including buses, taxis, ride-hailing services, and tro-tros (minibuses). The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Accra having a more comprehensive and efficient system. Most people in Ghana get around using tro-tros or shared taxis, which are affordable and widely available. However, the traffic in major cities like Accra and Kumasi can be heavy, making commute times longer than expected.

The transportation system in Ghana is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 22.9% affecting the cost of fuel and transportation. Additionally, the GDP per capita PPP of $8,020 indicates that many Ghanaians have a relatively low disposable income, making affordable transportation options essential. The government's education spend of 2.9% of GDP also highlights the need for efficient and affordable transportation options for students and commuters.
