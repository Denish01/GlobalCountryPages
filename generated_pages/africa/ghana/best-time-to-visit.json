Peak season: December to February. Budget season: April to June and September to November. Avoid: July to August due to the heavy rainfall and high humidity. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nGhana has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by dry and cool weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C. This season is ideal for traveling, as the weather is pleasant and there are fewer mosquitoes, reducing the risk of malaria. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is divided into two parts: the minor wet season from May to July and the major wet season from September to November. During this time, the country experiences heavy rainfall, which can make traveling challenging, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe climate in Ghana varies from north to south, with the north being generally drier and hotter than the south. The coastal regions, where the capital city Accra is located, experience a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C throughout the year. The mountainous regions in the east, such as the **Akwapim-Togo Ranges**, have a cooler climate, with average temperatures ranging from 18°C to 24°C.\n\nThe seasons in Ghana have a significant impact on travel, as the wet season can make roads impassable, and the dry season can be very dusty. Additionally, the wet season is the peak season for malaria, and travelers should take necessary precautions to prevent the disease. Overall, the dry season is the best time to visit Ghana, as the weather is pleasant, and the roads are easily accessible.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Dry and cool | Low | $ | Beach activities, hiking |\n| February | Dry and cool | Medium | $$ | Cultural festivals, city tours |\n| March | Dry and cool | Medium | $$ | Wildlife viewing, outdoor activities |\n| April | Hot and dry | Low | $ | Visiting the north, cultural events |\n| May | Hot and wet | Low | $ | Visiting the coastal regions, water sports |\n| June | Wet and humid | Low | $ | Visiting the mountainous regions, trekking |\n| July | Wet and humid | Low | $ | Visiting the coastal regions, surfing |\n| August | Wet and humid | Low | $ | Visiting the north, cultural events |\n| September | Wet and humid | Medium | $$ | Visiting the coastal regions, water sports |\n| October | Hot and dry | Medium | $$ | Visiting the north, cultural events |\n| November | Hot and dry | Medium | $$ | Visiting the mountainous regions, trekking |\n| December | Dry and cool | High | $$$ | Beach activities, cultural festivals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Akwasidae Festival | April and October | A traditional festival celebrated by the Ashanti people to honor their ancestors |\n| Homowo Festival | May | A traditional festival celebrated by the Ga people to mark the beginning of the harvest season |\n| Afrochella | December | A music and arts festival that celebrates African culture |\n| Ghana Independence Day | March | A national holiday that celebrates Ghana's independence from British colonial rule |\n| Eid al-Fitr | varies | A Muslim holiday that celebrates the end of Ramadan |\n| Chale Wote Festival | August | A street art festival that showcases the work of local artists |\n| Panafest | July and August | A cultural festival that celebrates the African diaspora |\n| Emancipation Day | August | A national holiday that celebrates the emancipation of slaves in Ghana |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **coastal regions** in the south experience a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C throughout the year.\n- The **northern regions** are generally drier and hotter than the south, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C throughout the year.\n- The **mountainous regions** in the east have a cooler climate, with average temperatures ranging from 18°C to 24°C throughout the year.\n- The **forest regions** in the center of the country experience a more humid climate, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 28°C throughout the year.\n- The **savannah regions** in the north experience a dry and hot climate, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C throughout the year.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to June and September to November, to avoid the crowds and high prices.\n- Pack light and breathable clothing, as well as sunscreen and insect repellent, to protect yourself from the sun and mosquitoes.\n- Be sure to check the weather forecast before traveling to Ghana, as the weather can be unpredictable.\n- Avoid traveling during the heavy rainfall months, from July to August, as the roads can be impassable and the risk of malaria is higher.\n- Consider purchasing travel insurance that covers medical and travel-related expenses, in case of unexpected events or emergencies.",
