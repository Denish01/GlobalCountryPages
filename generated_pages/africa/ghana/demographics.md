[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana's population size can be put into context by comparing it to other countries in West Africa, where it is one of the most populous nations. The country's population growth rate is relatively high, with an average annual increase of 2.2%, which is driven by a combination of factors including a high total fertility rate and a declining mortality rate. Ghana is also experiencing rapid urbanization, with approximately 57% of its population living in urban areas, which is driving economic growth and development. However, this rapid urbanization also poses significant challenges, including the provision of adequate housing, infrastructure, and services to meet the needs of the growing urban population. In terms of migration patterns, Ghana is both a source and destination country, with many Ghanaians migrating to other countries in search of better economic opportunities, while also receiving migrants from other West African countries.

The population of Ghana is also characterized by a high proportion of young people, with approximately 40% of the population under the age of 15. This demographic trend has significant implications for the country's development, as it will require significant investments in education, healthcare, and other social services to support the needs of this growing population. Furthermore, Ghana's population is also experiencing a shift towards an aging population, with an increasing proportion of older people, which will require the development of social security systems and other support services to meet their needs.

Ghana's population growth and urbanization trends are also closely linked to its economic development, with many people moving to urban areas in search of better economic opportunities. The country's major cities, including Accra, Kumasi, and Tamale, are experiencing rapid growth and development, with significant investments in infrastructure, housing, and other services. However, this rapid growth also poses significant challenges, including the provision of adequate housing, sanitation, and other services to meet the needs of the growing urban population.
