[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana's rental market is relatively moderate in terms of affordability, with prices varying depending on the location, amenities, and quality of the property. The typical lease term in Ghana is one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Rent Control Law, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Ghana's housing costs are relatively higher than those in Togo and Burkina Faso, but lower than those in Ivory Coast. The high inflation rate of 22.9% in 2024 may impact the housing market, with potential increases in rent and property prices.

The Ghanaian government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the provision of affordable housing units and the development of new residential areas. However, the demand for housing still exceeds the supply, particularly in urban areas like Accra. As a result, renters may face challenges in finding affordable and suitable accommodations, especially in desirable neighborhoods. It is essential for renters to research the local market, work with reputable agents, and carefully review lease agreements to ensure a smooth and successful rental experience.
