  "content": "Doing business in Ghana can be relatively easy, with the country ranking 114th out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, and offering various investment opportunities in key sectors such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEase of Doing Business: 114/190 (World Bank ranking context)\nCorporate Tax Rate: 25%\nFDI Inflow: $1.1 billion (annual)\nSpecial Economic Zones: Yes, 2\nKey Industries: Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing\nCurrency Stability: Moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]\nGhana has a relatively stable business environment, with a democratic government that is generally supportive of foreign investment. The government has implemented various policies and reforms to improve the business climate, including the establishment of a one-stop shop for business registration and the introduction of a new investment code. However, bureaucracy and corruption can still be a challenge, particularly when dealing with government agencies and regulatory bodies. The country has made significant progress in recent years in improving its ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index, but more needs to be done to address this issue.\n\nThe government's attitude towards foreign investment is generally positive, with various incentives and benefits offered to attract foreign investors. These include tax exemptions, duty-free imports, and investment guarantees. However, the business environment can be affected by factors such as power outages, transportation challenges, and a shortage of skilled labor. Despite these challenges, Ghana remains one of the most attractive investment destinations in West Africa, with a growing economy and a large market.\n\nGhana's economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the expansion of the services sector, increased investment in the oil and gas sector, and a rebound in the agricultural sector. The country has also made significant progress in improving its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and ports.
