[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet quality in Ghana is generally good, with an average download speed of 10 Mbps, although this can vary depending on the location and the mobile network carrier. In urban areas such as Accra, Kumasi, and Takoradi, the internet connection is relatively fast and reliable, with many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offering WiFi services. However, in rural areas, the internet connection can be slow and less reliable, with limited mobile network coverage and fewer WiFi options available. The urban-rural divide in internet access is a significant challenge in Ghana, with many rural communities lacking access to reliable and affordable internet services.

The reliability of the internet in Ghana is also a concern, with frequent power outages and network downtime affecting the quality of the connection. However, the government and mobile network carriers are working to improve the internet infrastructure and expand mobile network coverage to rural areas, which is expected to improve the overall internet quality and reliability in the country. Despite these challenges, Ghana has made significant progress in recent years in increasing internet penetration and improving internet services, with many Ghanaians now able to access the internet through their mobile phones or computers.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Ghana, you can visit any of the mobile network carrier's offices or authorized dealers, such as MTN, Vodafone, or AirtelTigo, and purchase a tourist SIM card for around 10 USD.

The registration process is relatively straightforward, and the SIM card can be activated immediately. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable dealer or the carrier's office to avoid any issues with the SIM card or the registration process.
