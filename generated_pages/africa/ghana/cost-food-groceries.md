[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Ghana are generally higher than the regional average, mainly due to the country's reliance on imports and the high cost of transportation. The **inflation rate** of 22.9% in 2024 has also driven up prices, making it challenging for locals and expats alike to afford basic necessities. Despite the high costs, eating out is a popular culture in Ghana, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a wide range of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is still the most economical option, with many Ghanaians opting to prepare their own meals using fresh ingredients from local markets.

The high cost of food in Ghana is also driven by the country's limited agricultural production, which forces the country to rely on imports to meet its food needs. This, combined with the high cost of transportation and storage, contributes to the high prices of food staples such as rice, maize, and poultry. Nevertheless, Ghana has a vibrant food culture, with many local dishes such as **fufu**, **banku**, and **jollof rice** being affordable and delicious options for those on a budget.
