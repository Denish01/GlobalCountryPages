[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with public schools generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 11 years, from primary school to junior high school. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula including British, American, and International Baccalaureate. These schools cater to expatriate children and Ghanaians who can afford the high fees, and offer a high-quality education that is often comparable to international standards.

The quality of education in Ghana varies significantly between public and private schools, with private schools generally offering better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum. However, private schools are often expensive and out of reach for many Ghanaians, who rely on public schools that are often underfunded and understaffed. Despite these challenges, Ghana has made significant progress in increasing access to education in recent years, with enrollment rates rising significantly at all levels of education.
