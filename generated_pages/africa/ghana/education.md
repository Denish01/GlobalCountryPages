[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Ghana is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as basic education, is compulsory for all children and lasts for six years. Secondary education, also known as senior high school, lasts for three years and is also compulsory. Tertiary education, which includes universities, polytechnics, and colleges, provides students with the opportunity to pursue higher education and professional training. The quality of education in Ghana is generally good, with a strong focus on **mathematics**, **science**, and **English language**. However, there are some challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to education is limited and the quality of education is often lower.

The education system in Ghana is a mix of public and private institutions, with the government providing funding for public schools and universities. Private schools and universities, on the other hand, are funded by tuition fees and other private sources. The public education system is generally considered to be of good quality, but it is often overcrowded and underfunded. Private schools and universities, on the other hand, are often better resourced and provide a higher quality of education, but they can be expensive and inaccessible to many students.

Overall, the education system in Ghana provides students with a wide range of opportunities to pursue their academic and professional goals, but there are still some challenges that need to be addressed, particularly in terms of access to education and the quality of education in rural areas.
