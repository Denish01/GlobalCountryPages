The typical lease term in Ghana is one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Rent Control Law, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Ghana's housing costs are relatively higher than those in Togo and Burkina Faso, but lower than those in Ivory Coast. The high inflation rate of 22.9% in 2024 may impact the housing market, with potential increases in rent and property prices.\n\nThe Ghanaian government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the provision of affordable housing units and the development of new residential areas. However, the demand for housing still exceeds the supply, particularly in urban areas like Accra. As a result, renters may face challenges in finding affordable and suitable accommodations, especially in desirable neighborhoods. It is essential for renters to research the local market, work with reputable agents, and carefully review lease agreements to ensure a smooth and successful rental experience.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$250 | $100-$200 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$350 | $150-$300 | self-contained, decent condition |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $250-$450 | spacious, modern amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $350-$600 | large, luxurious finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $100-$200 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $50-$150 | residential areas, decent amenities |\n| Rural | $20-$50 | basic infrastructure, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Achimota**: a popular neighborhood in Accra with a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, and a mix of local and international amenities, with rent prices ranging from $200 to $500 per month.\n- **Cantonments**: a upscale neighborhood with modern amenities, including shopping centers and restaurants, and a range of housing options, from apartments to villas, with rent prices ranging from $300 to $700 per month.\n- **Labone**: a trendy neighborhood with a mix of local and international restaurants, bars, and shops, and a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, with rent prices ranging from $250 to $500 per month.\n- **Osborne**: a quiet neighborhood with a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, and easy access to the city center, with rent prices ranging from $200 to $400 per month.\n- **East Legon**: a rapidly developing neighborhood with a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, and a mix of local and international amenities, with rent prices ranging from $150 to $350 per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Ghana [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and work with reputable agents to find suitable accommodations.\n- Carefully review lease agreements and negotiate terms, including rent, deposit, and amenities.\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that the property is legitimate and the landlord is reputable.\n- Utilities, such as electricity and water, are usually not included in the rent, and renters should budget for these expenses.\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Ghana, and renters may need to provide their own furniture and appliances.\n- [CALLOUT] It is essential to inspect the property before signing a lease agreement and to take photos and notes to document the condition of the property.",
