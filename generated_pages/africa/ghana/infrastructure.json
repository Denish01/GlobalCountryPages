  "content": "Ghana's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 85% of population\nInternet Penetration: 40%\nRoad Network: 13,787 km, moderate quality with some paved and unpaved sections\nRail Network: 947 km, poor condition\nMajor Airports: 7\nMajor Ports: 2, Tema and Takoradi\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nGhana's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has made notable progress in recent years, with investments in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. However, challenges persist, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation remains limited. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including the development of a national infrastructure plan and the establishment of a dedicated infrastructure ministry.\n\nDespite these efforts, Ghana's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including inadequate funding, inefficient management, and a lack of maintenance. The country's infrastructure deficit is estimated to be around $1.5 billion per year, which is a significant burden on the government's budget. To address this challenge, the government has been exploring alternative funding options, including public-private partnerships and foreign investment.\n\nGhana's infrastructure development is also hindered by a lack of coordination and planning, which can lead to duplication of efforts and inefficient use of resources. To address this challenge, the government has established a national infrastructure coordination committee, which is responsible for overseeing the development of the country's infrastructure and ensuring that investments are aligned with national priorities.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 13,787 km | Moderate | 33% paved, 67% unpaved |\n| Railways | 947 km | Poor | Limited passenger and freight services |\n| Airports | 7 international, 4 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, but limited capacity |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Tema and Takoradi ports, with limited capacity and efficiency |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Ghana's power generation mix is dominated by **thermal power**, which accounts for around 50% of total generation capacity.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing access to electricity, with around 85% of the population now having access to power.\n- However, the **reliability of the power supply** remains a challenge, with frequent outages and voltage fluctuations.\n- Ghana has set a target of increasing the share of **renewable energy** in the energy mix to 10% by 2030, with a focus on solar and wind power.\n- The government has also implemented a number of initiatives to improve the efficiency of the energy sector, including the introduction of **smart meters** and the promotion of energy-efficient appliances.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **safe drinking water** is a significant challenge in Ghana, particularly in rural areas where around 20% of the population lacks access to improved water sources.\n- The country has made progress in increasing access to **sanitation facilities**, with around 80% of the population now having access to improved sanitation.\n- However, the quality of **water treatment** remains a concern, with many water treatment plants lacking the capacity to provide safe and reliable water supplies.\n- Ghana has set a target of increasing access to **improved water sources** to 90% by 2030, with a focus on rural areas.\n- The government has also implemented a number of initiatives to improve **water conservation** and **wastewater management**, including the introduction of **water-saving technologies** and the promotion of **wastewater reuse**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Ghana has a relatively well-developed **telecommunications sector**, with around 40% of the population having access to the internet.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing access to **mobile phone services**, with around 80% of the population now having access to mobile phones.\n- However, the quality of **internet services** remains a challenge, with slow speeds and frequent outages.\n- Ghana has set a target of increasing access to **broadband internet** to 50% by 2030, with a focus on rural areas.\n- The government has also implemented a number of initiatives to improve **cybersecurity**, including the establishment of a national **cybersecurity agency** and the introduction of **cybersecurity regulations**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a number of major infrastructure development projects, including the **Accra-Tema Motorway**, which is expected to improve transportation links between the two cities.\n- Ghana has also secured funding for the **Ghana-Burkina Faso Railway** project, which will improve transportation links between the two countries.\n- The government has also implemented a number of initiatives to improve **energy efficiency**, including the introduction of **energy-efficient lighting** and the promotion of **renewable energy**.\n- The **Tema Port Expansion** project is also underway, which will increase the capacity of the port and improve efficiency.\n- The government has also launched a number of initiatives to improve **water and sanitation services**, including the **Ghana Water Company** expansion project, which will increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities.",
