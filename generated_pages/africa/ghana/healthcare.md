[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana's healthcare system is structured into three main tiers: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with the Ministry of Health overseeing the system. However, the quality of care and access to healthcare facilities vary significantly between urban and rural areas. Urban areas like Accra and Kumasi have better-equipped hospitals and more specialized healthcare professionals, while rural areas often rely on basic healthcare facilities with limited resources. The private sector plays a significant role in Ghana's healthcare system, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, especially in urban areas.

The public healthcare system in Ghana is generally underfunded and faces challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, shortage of healthcare professionals, and limited access to specialized care. Despite these challenges, Ghana has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services, particularly for vulnerable populations like women and children. The country has also implemented various health programs, including the **National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)**, which aims to provide affordable healthcare to all citizens.

The quality of care in Ghana's healthcare system is generally good, with many healthcare professionals receiving training in reputable institutions. However, there are concerns about the availability of specialized care, particularly in rural areas. The **Ghana Health Service** is the main provider of public healthcare services, and it has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of care, including the introduction of **telemedicine** services to increase access to specialized care.
