# Ghana Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Ghana's culture is a rich and diverse blend of traditional and modern influences. The country has over 100 ethnic groups, with the Akan being the largest. The Akan people are known for their expertise in goldsmithing, wood carving, and kente cloth weaving. Ghana's cultural identity is also shaped by its history as a former British colony, which introduced English as the official language and Christianity as a dominant religion. However, traditional African beliefs and practices still play a significant role in many Ghanaians' daily lives. The country's cultural diversity is reflected in its many languages, with over 40 languages spoken across the country.

Ghana's cultural identity is also influenced by its geographical location. The country's coastal region has been shaped by its history of trade with European colonizers, while the northern region has been influenced by its proximity to the Sahel region and the Islamic traditions of neighboring countries. The country's cultural diversity is also reflected in its many festivals and traditions, which are often specific to particular regions or ethnic groups. For example, the Akwasidae festival is celebrated by the Akan people, while the Damba festival is celebrated by the people of the northern region.

Ghana's cultural identity is also defined by its strong sense of community and hospitality. Ghanaians are known for their warm welcome to visitors, and the concept of **ubuntu** (humanity towards others) is deeply ingrained in the culture. Respect for elders and tradition is also highly valued, and visitors are often expected to show deference to older individuals and traditional customs. Overall, Ghana's cultural identity is a unique blend of traditional and modern influences, shaped by its history, geography, and cultural diversity.
