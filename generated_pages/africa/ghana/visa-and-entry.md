[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from over 30 countries eligible for visa-free entry or visa on arrival. The country aims to promote tourism and economic development, while also maintaining national security and public health. Citizens from eligible countries can stay in Ghana for a specified period, usually up to 30 or 90 days, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit.

The country has introduced an electronic visa (eVisa) system to simplify the application process and reduce processing times. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and travelers should always check with the official embassy or consulate of Ghana for the latest information.
