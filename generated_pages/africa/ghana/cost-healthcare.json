  "content": "In Ghana, healthcare costs vary significantly between public and private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $70, and out-of-pocket spending accounting for 26.7% of total health expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $70\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 26.7%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 191\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: GHS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGhana's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally less expensive but often overcrowded and understaffed, while private facilities offer better quality care but at a higher cost. For locals, the public system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private facilities. The system is generally well-organized, with a clear hierarchy of healthcare providers, from community health centers to regional hospitals. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the facility and location.\n\nThe Ghanaian government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and affordability, including the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). While the NHIS has increased access to healthcare for many Ghanaians, it has its limitations, and many people still rely on out-of-pocket payments for healthcare services. For foreigners, it is highly recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in Ghana, as the public system may not provide the level of care they are accustomed to. Many private insurance providers offer plans that cover medical expenses in Ghana, and some even offer evacuation services to other countries if necessary.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$300 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | |\n| X-Ray | $10-$20 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Outpatient services, basic hospitalization |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Inpatient and outpatient services, specialist consultations, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Comprehensive coverage, including evacuation services, dental, and vision care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications like antibiotics and painkillers are widely available at pharmacies and cost between $5-$10.\n- Prescription rules are generally lax, and many medications can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- Pharmacies are readily available in urban areas, but less so in rural areas.\n- The cost of medications can vary significantly depending on the brand and type.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n- It is essential to note that counterfeit medications are a significant problem in Ghana, and it is crucial to purchase medications from reputable pharmacies.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 191, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but they may not always be reliable or promptly available. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek care at private hospitals, which generally offer better quality care and have more modern equipment. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Ghana include the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra and the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi. It is also a good idea to research and identify the nearest hospital or medical facility before an emergency arises, as this can save valuable time and improve outcomes. Additionally, many private hospitals have emergency rooms and offer 24-hour care, making them a better option for foreigners who require immediate attention.",
