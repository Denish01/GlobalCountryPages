[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by dry and cool weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C. This season is ideal for traveling, as the weather is pleasant and there are fewer mosquitoes, reducing the risk of malaria. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is divided into two parts: the minor wet season from May to July and the major wet season from September to November. During this time, the country experiences heavy rainfall, which can make traveling challenging, especially in rural areas.

The climate in Ghana varies from north to south, with the north being generally drier and hotter than the south. The coastal regions, where the capital city Accra is located, experience a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C throughout the year. The mountainous regions in the east, such as the **Akwapim-Togo Ranges**, have a cooler climate, with average temperatures ranging from 18°C to 24°C.

The seasons in Ghana have a significant impact on travel, as the wet season can make roads impassable, and the dry season can be very dusty. Additionally, the wet season is the peak season for malaria, and travelers should take necessary precautions to prevent the disease. Overall, the dry season is the best time to visit Ghana, as the weather is pleasant, and the roads are easily accessible.
