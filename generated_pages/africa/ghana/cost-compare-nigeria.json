Ghana has a relatively stable economy, with a strong focus on services and agriculture, while Nigeria has a more complex economy, driven by oil exports. In terms of cost of living, Ghana tends to be more affordable than Nigeria, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. According to various reports, Ghana's cost of living is approximately 15% lower than Nigeria's, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and tourists.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Ghana's economy has been growing steadily, with a GDP growth rate of 6.3% in 2020, while Nigeria's economy has been struggling, with a GDP growth rate of 2.3% in 2020. This disparity in economic growth has contributed to the difference in cost of living between the two countries. Additionally, Ghana's currency, the Ghanaian cedi, has been relatively stable, while the Nigerian naira has experienced significant fluctuations, which can impact the cost of living for foreigners.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ghana (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 350 | 28% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 200 | 25% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 500 | 700 | 29% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ghana (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 7 | 29% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 120 | 17% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ghana (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.7 | 29% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.0 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ghana (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 60 | 17% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Ghana (USD) | Nigeria (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 550 | 27% |\n| Mid-Range | 700 | 900 | 22% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,500 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Ghana is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices approximately 25-30% lower than in Nigeria\n- Food and dining, with meal prices approximately 20-30% lower than in Nigeria\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices approximately 20-30% lower than in Nigeria\n- Utilities and internet, with prices approximately 15-25% lower than in Nigeria\n- **Nigeria is cheaper for:**\n- Some electronic goods, with prices approximately 10-20% lower than in Ghana\n- Clothing and textiles, with prices approximately 15-25% lower than in Ghana\n- Local handicrafts and souvenirs, with prices approximately 20-30% lower than in Ghana\n- International flights, with some routes offering cheaper fares from Nigeria than from Ghana\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nGhana offers better value for expats, students, and tourists who are looking for a more affordable cost of living.
