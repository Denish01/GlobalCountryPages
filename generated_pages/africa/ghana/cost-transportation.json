  "content": "The cost of transportation in Ghana varies depending on the mode of transport, with a monthly transit pass costing around $10-$15 USD, while a taxi start rate is approximately $1-$2 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($10-$15 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($1-$2 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.20-$1.50 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (Yes — Uber, Bolt)\nCurrency: GHS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nGhana has a well-developed transportation network, with various modes of transport available, including buses, taxis, ride-hailing services, and tro-tros (minibuses). The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Accra having a more comprehensive and efficient system. Most people in Ghana get around using tro-tros or shared taxis, which are affordable and widely available. However, the traffic in major cities like Accra and Kumasi can be heavy, making commute times longer than expected.\n\nThe transportation system in Ghana is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 22.9% affecting the cost of fuel and transportation. Additionally, the GDP per capita PPP of $8,020 indicates that many Ghanaians have a relatively low disposable income, making affordable transportation options essential. The government's education spend of 2.9% of GDP also highlights the need for efficient and affordable transportation options for students and commuters.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage in smaller cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Ghana |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.20-$0.50 | N/A | Extensive network, affordable |\n| Commuter Train | $1-$2 | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly used for cargo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-$2 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Not always available |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$3 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Uber, Bolt available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.40 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in cities |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $1-$5 | Limited toll roads, mostly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Depending on bus company and route |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Typical route, e.g., Accra to Kumasi |\n| Train (long-distance) | $10-$30 | Limited routes, mostly used for cargo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use tro-tros or shared taxis for affordable and efficient travel within cities.\n- Download ride-hailing apps like Uber or Bolt for convenient transportation.\n- Negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey to avoid overcharging.\n- Be aware of traffic conditions and plan your commute accordingly.\n- Consider carpooling or using public transportation to save money on fuel and tolls.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow traffic rules to ensure safety on the road.",
