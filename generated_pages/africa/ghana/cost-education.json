  "content": "The cost of education in Ghana varies depending on the type of institution and the level of education, with public schools generally being more affordable than private schools, and international schools being the most expensive.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 2.9%\nLiteracy Rate: 79%\nSchool System: 11 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: GHS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nGhana's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with public schools generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 11 years, from primary school to junior high school. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula including British, American, and International Baccalaureate. These schools cater to expatriate children and Ghanaians who can afford the high fees, and offer a high-quality education that is often comparable to international standards.\n\nThe quality of education in Ghana varies significantly between public and private schools, with private schools generally offering better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum. However, private schools are often expensive and out of reach for many Ghanaians, who rely on public schools that are often underfunded and understaffed. Despite these challenges, Ghana has made significant progress in increasing access to education in recent years, with enrollment rates rising significantly at all levels of education.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$50 | Free or subsidized, but quality can be poor |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range of quality and fees, depending on the school |\n| Public Secondary | $50-$100 | Free or subsidized, but quality can be poor |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range of quality and fees, depending on the school |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | High-quality education, with fees varying depending on the curriculum and school |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $200-$500 | $1,000-$2,000 | Fees vary depending on the university and program |\n| Private University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Fees vary depending on the university and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$4,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | University of Ghana and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology are top-ranked |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Fees vary depending on the school and location |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Fees vary depending on the tutor and subject |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | Fees vary depending on the language and school |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$200 | Fees vary depending on the school and level of education |\n| School Uniform | $20-$100 | Fees vary depending on the school and quality of uniform |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Ghana are often international schools, which offer a high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- Scholarships are available for Ghanaian students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, to study at public and private universities.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Ghana, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The quality of education in Ghana is generally lower than in other West African countries, but there are many good schools and universities that offer a high-quality education.\n- [CALLOUT] It's worth noting that education costs in Ghana can be high, particularly for private schools and international schools, so it's essential to budget carefully and plan ahead.\n- The **Ghana Education Service** is responsible for overseeing education in Ghana, and provides information and resources for students, parents, and educators.",
