The **inflation rate** of 22.9% in 2024 has also driven up prices, making it challenging for locals and expats alike to afford basic necessities. Despite the high costs, eating out is a popular culture in Ghana, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a wide range of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is still the most economical option, with many Ghanaians opting to prepare their own meals using fresh ingredients from local markets.\n\nThe high cost of food in Ghana is also driven by the country's limited agricultural production, which forces the country to rely on imports to meet its food needs. This, combined with the high cost of transportation and storage, contributes to the high prices of food staples such as rice, maize, and poultry. Nevertheless, Ghana has a vibrant food culture, with many local dishes such as **fufu**, **banku**, and **jollof rice** being affordable and delicious options for those on a budget.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50-$2.50 | 10-15 GHS | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1-$2 | 5-10 GHS | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-$3 | 10-15 GHS | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 5-10 GHS | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 25-35 GHS | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $8-$10 | 40-50 GHS | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3-$5 | 15-25 GHS | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 5-10 GHS | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 5-10 GHS | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.50-$1 | 2-5 GHS | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 25-35 GHS | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-$2 | 5-10 GHS | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | (typical dishes like fufu, banku) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | (one person, local cuisine) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$30 | (3 courses, international cuisine) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | (upscale, fine dining experience) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of food items can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Ghana. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices ranging from 10-20% higher than those found at local markets.

Fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, are often cheaper and fresher at local markets. Meats, such as chicken and beef, may also be cheaper at local markets, but the quality can vary.
