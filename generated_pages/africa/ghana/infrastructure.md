# Ghana Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Ghana's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 85% of population
Internet Penetration: 40%
Road Network: 13,787 km, moderate quality with some paved and unpaved sections
Rail Network: 947 km, poor condition
Major Airports: 7
Major Ports: 2, Tema and Takoradi
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has made notable progress in recent years, with investments in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. However, challenges persist, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation remains limited. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including the development of a national infrastructure plan and the establishment of a dedicated infrastructure ministry.

Despite these efforts, Ghana's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including inadequate funding, inefficient management, and a lack of maintenance. The country's infrastructure deficit is estimated to be around $1.5 billion per year, which is a significant burden on the government's budget. To address this challenge, the government has been exploring alternative funding options, including public-private partnerships and foreign investment.

Ghana's infrastructure development is also hindered by a lack of coordination and planning, which can lead to duplication of efforts and inefficient use of resources. To address this challenge, the government has established a national infrastructure coordination committee, which is responsible for overseeing the development of the country's infrastructure and ensuring that investments are aligned with national priorities.
