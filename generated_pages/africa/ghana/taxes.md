[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana has a **territorial tax system**, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are taxed only on their Ghana-sourced income. To be considered a tax resident in Ghana, an individual must have a permanent home in the country and be present for at least 183 days in a year, or have a permanent home in Ghana and be present for at least 122 days in a year for at least three consecutive years. The tax system in Ghana is administered by the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs duties, and other levies.

The tax year in Ghana runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by April 30th of the following year. Taxpayers can file their returns electronically or manually, and they must also pay their taxes electronically or through authorized banks. The GRA has introduced various initiatives to simplify the tax filing process and encourage compliance, including the use of tax identification numbers and the introduction of a **tax amnesty** program for taxpayers who have not filed their returns in the past.
