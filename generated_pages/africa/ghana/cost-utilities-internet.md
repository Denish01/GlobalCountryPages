[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Ghana's utility infrastructure is relatively developed, with a high percentage of the population having access to electricity and water. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having more reliable access to utilities than rural areas. The cost of utilities in Ghana can be volatile, with prices fluctuating due to factors such as changes in global fuel prices and government policies. For example, the cost of electricity has increased in recent years due to a combination of factors, including a rise in fuel prices and a depreciation of the local currency, the Ghanaian cedi (GHS).

The cost of utilities in Ghana can also vary depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season (December to April) leading to increased prices. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the region, with some areas having higher costs due to factors such as transportation costs and local taxes. Overall, while Ghana's utility infrastructure is relatively developed, the cost of utilities can be a significant burden for many households, particularly those with lower incomes.
