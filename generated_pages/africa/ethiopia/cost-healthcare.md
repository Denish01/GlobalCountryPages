[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in limited access to quality healthcare, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality care but are often expensive and out of reach for the average Ethiopian citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. Having insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help cover the high costs of private healthcare.

The Ethiopian government has been working to improve the healthcare system, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas. However, the system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, limited infrastructure, and inadequate funding. For foreigners, it is essential to have insurance that covers medical evacuation, as the quality of care in Ethiopia may not be up to international standards. Additionally, many private healthcare facilities require payment upfront, so it is crucial to have a means of paying for medical expenses.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 907, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.

For foreigners, it is recommended to seek medical attention at private hospitals, which often have better facilities and more skilled healthcare professionals.
