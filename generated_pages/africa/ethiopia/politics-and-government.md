[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Ethiopia is structured to provide a system of checks and balances among the three branches. The **executive branch**, led by the Prime Minister, is responsible for the day-to-day governance of the country. The **legislative branch**, composed of the House of Peoples' Representatives and the House of Federation, is responsible for making laws and approving the budget. The **judicial branch**, composed of the Federal Supreme Court and lower courts, is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are applied fairly. Ethiopia is a **federal** system, with power divided between the federal government and the nine regional states, each with its own government and powers.

The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Ethiopian Constitution, which provides for an independent judiciary and a system of checks and balances among the branches. The Constitution also guarantees **human rights** and **fundamental freedoms**, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association. However, the government has been criticized for its human rights record, particularly with regard to freedom of speech and assembly.

The **federal system** in Ethiopia is designed to provide a degree of autonomy to the regional states, each of which has its own government and powers. The regional states are responsible for providing services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign policy, and national security.
