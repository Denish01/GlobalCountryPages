[SECTION] Overview: Ethiopia vs Kenya [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Ethiopia and Kenya varies significantly, with Ethiopia being the more affordable option. Ethiopia has a lower GDP per capita and a higher inflation rate compared to Kenya, which can contribute to the differences in cost of living. However, Ethiopia's lower cost of living can be attributed to its relatively low prices for housing, food, and transportation. In contrast, Kenya has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which can drive up costs. Overall, Ethiopia is a more budget-friendly option for expats, students, and travelers.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living.

Kenya, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and technology. The difference in economic context can affect the prices of goods and services, with Kenya tend to be more expensive due to its more developed infrastructure and higher demand for goods and services. Despite this, Ethiopia remains a more affordable option, with a cost of living that is roughly 15-20% lower than Kenya.
