  "content": "In Ethiopia, the internet is generally available, but the quality and speed can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better connectivity than rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Ethio Telecom, Safaricom, Orange\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Ethiopia has undergone significant improvements in recent years, but it still lags behind many other countries in terms of speed and reliability. The average internet speed is around 5 Mbps, which can be frustrating for users who are accustomed to faster speeds. However, this speed is still sufficient for basic tasks such as browsing, emailing, and social media. The main challenge is the urban vs rural divide, where urban areas like Addis Ababa tend to have better internet connectivity than rural areas. In rural areas, the internet can be slow and unreliable, making it difficult for users to stay connected.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Ethiopia can also be a challenge, with frequent outages and disruptions to service. This can be frustrating for users who rely on the internet for work or communication. However, the government has been investing in the development of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, which is expected to improve the quality and reliability of the internet in the coming years. Despite the challenges, the internet is still an essential tool for many Ethiopians, and it has the potential to play a significant role in the country's economic and social development.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Ethiopia is relatively straightforward, with several mobile providers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers are Ethio Telecom, Safaricom, and Orange, which offer a range of plans to suit different needs and budgets. To get a SIM card, users will need to provide their passport and a copy of their visa, as well as fill out a registration form. SIM cards can be purchased at mobile provider stores, as well as at many retail outlets and kiosks. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, which includes a certain amount of data and airtime.\n\nThe recommended carriers for tourists are Ethio Telecom and Safaricom, which offer a range of plans with different data allowances and prices. For example, Ethio Telecom's tourist plan includes 1 GB of data and 10 minutes of airtime for around 5 USD. Safaricom's plan includes 2 GB of data and 20 minutes of airtime for around 10 USD. It's worth noting that data speeds can vary greatly depending on the location, so it's a good idea to check the coverage and speed in the areas you plan to visit before purchasing a SIM card.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethio Telecom | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Includes 10 minutes of airtime |\n| Safaricom | Tourist Plan | 2 GB | 10 | Includes 20 minutes of airtime |\n| Orange | Tourist Plan | 500 MB | 3 | Includes 5 minutes of airtime |\n| Telebirr | Tourist Plan | 3 GB | 15 | Includes 30 minutes of airtime |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality can vary greatly, with some hotels offering fast and reliable connections, while others may have slower and more unreliable connections.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not as widespread in Ethiopia as it is in other countries, but many cafes and restaurants in urban areas do offer WiFi to their customers.\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more popular in Addis Ababa, with many offering fast and reliable WiFi connections, as well as other amenities such as meeting rooms and printing services.\n- Public WiFi is not widely available in Ethiopia, but some airports, hotels, and restaurants may offer free or paid WiFi to their customers.\n- Some universities and educational institutions also offer WiFi to their students and staff, but this is generally not available to the general public.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces such as **Impact Hub** and **Iceaddis** offer fast and reliable WiFi connections, as well as other amenities such as meeting rooms and printing services.\n- Reliable cafe chains such as **Tomoca** and **Kaldi's** offer WiFi to their customers, as well as a comfortable and productive work environment.\n- Backup internet options such as portable WiFi hotspots and mobile data plans can be useful in case of an outage or disruption to service.\n- VPNs can be useful for remote workers who need to access certain websites or services that are blocked in Ethiopia.\n- Some hotels and resorts also offer **co-working facilities** and **meeting rooms** for remote workers and digital nomads.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a significant issue in Ethiopia, with many websites and services blocked by the government.\n- Some social media platforms and news websites may be blocked, so it's a good idea to use a VPN to access these services.\n- Roaming alternatives such as portable WiFi hotspots and mobile data plans can be useful for travelers who need to stay connected.\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Ethiopia, so it's a good idea to purchase a physical SIM card instead.\n- It's also a good idea to use a **secure VPN** to protect your data and identity when using public WiFi or other unsecured connections.\n- Be aware of your data usage and **monitor your account** to avoid unexpected charges or data overage fees.",
