  "content": "In Ethiopia, the cost of healthcare varies significantly between public and private facilities, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often limited in quality and availability, while private healthcare offers better quality but at a higher cost, with a health expenditure per capita of $35.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $35 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: approximately 70-80% of total healthcare expenditure\nHealthcare System: Mixed (Public and Private)\nEmergency Number: 907 (local emergency number)\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: ETB\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nEthiopia's healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in limited access to quality healthcare, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality care but are often expensive and out of reach for the average Ethiopian citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. Having insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help cover the high costs of private healthcare.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has been working to improve the healthcare system, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas. However, the system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, limited infrastructure, and inadequate funding. For foreigners, it is essential to have insurance that covers medical evacuation, as the quality of care in Ethiopia may not be up to international standards. Additionally, many private healthcare facilities require payment upfront, so it is crucial to have a means of paying for medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $1-5 | $10-30 | Public hospitals often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $5-10 | $20-50 | Private clinics may require payment upfront |\n| Dental Checkup | $2-5 | $10-20 | Limited availability of dental services in public hospitals |\n| Eye Exam | $2-5 | $10-20 | Private optometrists may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-10 | $10-20 | Public hospitals may have limited laboratory facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $10-50 | Private hospitals may charge more for emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $10-50 | Public hospitals often have limited bed availability |\n| Basic Surgery | $50-200 | Private clinics may offer more advanced surgical facilities |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $20-100 | Public hospitals may have limited obstetric services |\n| MRI Scan | $50-200 | Limited availability of MRI machines in public hospitals |\n| X-Ray | $5-10 | Public hospitals may have limited radiology facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-20 | Covers public hospital services, limited outpatient care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Covers private hospital services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Covers medical evacuation, comprehensive medical services, and emergency care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a doctor's prescription, with costs varying depending on the type of medication and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and retail stores, with prices starting from $1-5.\n- Common medications such as painkillers and antacids can be purchased for $1-5.\n- Antibiotics and other prescription medications can cost $5-20.\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.\n- It is essential to note that counterfeit medication is a significant problem in Ethiopia, so it is crucial to purchase medication from reputable pharmacies.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 907, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. However, the quality of emergency care can vary significantly depending on the hospital and location. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek medical attention at private hospitals, which often have better facilities and more skilled healthcare professionals. The best hospitals for foreigners in Addis Ababa include the **Ethio-American** and **Korean** hospitals, which offer high-quality medical services and have English-speaking staff. It is also crucial to have a means of paying for medical expenses, as many hospitals require payment upfront. Additionally, having insurance that covers medical evacuation can be lifesaving in case of a severe medical emergency.",
