  "content": "Ethiopia is generally cheaper than Kenya, with a cost of living that is approximately 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEthiopia GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,244\nKenya GDP per Capita (PPP): 4,509\nEthiopia Inflation Rate: 20.6%\nKenya Inflation Rate: 5.3%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Ethiopia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Ethiopia vs Kenya [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Ethiopia and Kenya varies significantly, with Ethiopia being the more affordable option. Ethiopia has a lower GDP per capita and a higher inflation rate compared to Kenya, which can contribute to the differences in cost of living. However, Ethiopia's lower cost of living can be attributed to its relatively low prices for housing, food, and transportation. In contrast, Kenya has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which can drive up costs. Overall, Ethiopia is a more budget-friendly option for expats, students, and travelers.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Ethiopia has a rapidly growing economy, with a focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Kenya, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and technology. The difference in economic context can affect the prices of goods and services, with Kenya tend to be more expensive due to its more developed infrastructure and higher demand for goods and services. Despite this, Ethiopia remains a more affordable option, with a cost of living that is roughly 15-20% lower than Kenya.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Ethiopia (USD) | Kenya (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Ethiopia is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 30-40% lower than Kenya\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries that are 30-50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with transit passes and taxi fares that are 50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices that are 30-40% cheaper\n\n- **Kenya is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, which may be more readily available and affordable in Kenya\n- High-end accommodations and luxury services, which may be more developed in Kenya\n- Tourist activities and excursions, which may be more expensive in Ethiopia due to limited infrastructure\n- Access to high-quality healthcare and education, which may be more developed in Kenya\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and travelers on a budget, Ethiopia is likely the better option due to its lower cost of living and more affordable prices for housing, food, and transportation.
