[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Ethiopia is relatively underdeveloped, with a significant shortage of housing, particularly in urban areas. The demand for housing is high, driven by the country's rapid urbanization and population growth. As a result, rent prices have been increasing rapidly, especially in the city center of Addis Ababa. Typical lease terms in Ethiopia range from 6 months to 2 years, with a deposit requirement of 1-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and the **rent control** laws are not strictly enforced, which can make it challenging for renters to negotiate fair rent prices.

Compared to its regional neighbors, Ethiopia's housing costs are relatively affordable. However, the high **inflation rate** of 21.0% can erode the purchasing power of renters, making it essential to factor in the potential for rent increases when signing a lease. The average **health expenditure per capita** of $35 and **education spend** of 2.3% of GDP also indicate that the country still faces significant development challenges, which can impact the overall quality of life and housing options.
