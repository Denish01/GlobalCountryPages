# Ethiopia Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Ethiopia before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of about 40 countries, including Kenya, Djibouti, and Sudan, can enter Ethiopia visa-free, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an e-visa system. The Ethiopian government has been working to simplify its visa process and attract more tourists and business travelers to the country.

The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism, trade, and investment. The Ethiopian government has introduced an e-visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to apply for a visa online before their trip. This system has made it easier for travelers to obtain a visa and has reduced the processing time.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The main entry points to Ethiopia are Addis Ababa Bole International Airport and the land borders with neighboring countries. Upon arrival, travelers must go through immigration and customs procedures, which include presenting their passport, visa (if required), and completed customs declaration form. Travelers may also be required to provide proof of onward travel and sufficient funds for their stay. The immigration process can take some time, especially during peak travel seasons, so it's essential to be patient and have all the required documents ready.

Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is the primary hub for international flights, and it has a modern terminal with efficient immigration and customs procedures. The airport also has a visa on arrival facility for eligible citizens. Land borders, on the other hand, may have more limited facilities and longer processing times, so it's essential to research the specific requirements and procedures for each border crossing.
