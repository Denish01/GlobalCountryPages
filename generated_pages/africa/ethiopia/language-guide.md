[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia is a linguistically diverse country with over 80 languages spoken across the country. **Amharic**, the official language, is spoken by the majority of the population and is used as a lingua franca for communication between people from different regions. However, other languages such as **Oromo**, **Somali**, and **Tigrinya** are also widely spoken in their respective regions. English is not widely spoken, especially outside of urban areas, and proficiency levels are generally low. The **Ge'ez** script is used to write Amharic and other languages, and the language family is **Semitic**, which is also spoken in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa.

The linguistic landscape of Ethiopia is complex, with many regional dialects and minority languages spoken across the country. In urban areas such as **Addis Ababa**, English is more widely spoken, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. However, in rural areas, English is not as commonly spoken, and visitors may need to rely on **Amharic** or other local languages to communicate.

Ethiopia's language diversity is also reflected in its language policy, which recognizes the importance of promoting and preserving the country's linguistic heritage. The government has implemented language education programs to promote the use of **Amharic** and other local languages, while also encouraging the learning of English as a foreign language.
