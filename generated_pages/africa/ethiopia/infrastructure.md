# Ethiopia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Ethiopia's infrastructure is rapidly developing, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications, although gaps remain between urban and rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 44% of population
Internet Penetration: 15%
Road Network: 110,000 km, with moderate quality and ongoing upgrades
Rail Network: 794 km, with plans for expansion
Major Airports: 3 international, 15 domestic
Major Ports: 2, via neighboring Djibouti
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's infrastructure development level is steadily improving, driven by government initiatives and foreign investment. The country has made significant strides in recent years, with a focus on upgrading its transportation networks, increasing access to electricity, and expanding telecommunications services. However, a notable urban-rural gap persists, with cities like Addis Ababa and Hawassa enjoying relatively better infrastructure than rural areas. The government has launched various development plans, including the Growth and Transformation Plan, to address these disparities and promote economic growth.

Ethiopia's infrastructure sector has attracted significant investment from international partners, including China, the United States, and the European Union. These investments have supported the development of major infrastructure projects, such as the construction of new highways, railways, and energy generation facilities. Despite these efforts, the country still faces challenges in providing adequate infrastructure services to its rapidly growing population.

The government has recognized the importance of infrastructure development in driving economic growth and has prioritized investments in this sector. However, the pace of progress remains uneven, and more work is needed to address the significant infrastructure gaps that exist, particularly in rural areas. Ongoing efforts to improve governance, increase private sector participation, and enhance regional cooperation are expected to support the development of Ethiopia's infrastructure sector.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- **Hydroelectric power** is the primary source of electricity generation, with several major dams, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, under construction or in operation.
- The **reliability of electricity supply** remains a challenge, with frequent outages reported in some areas, particularly during periods of high demand.
- **Renewable energy** sources, such as wind and solar power, are becoming increasingly important, with several projects under development to support the country's energy mix.
- The government has launched initiatives to **improve energy efficiency** and reduce energy losses in the transmission and distribution systems.
- **Private sector participation** is being encouraged to support the development of the energy sector, including the construction of new power generation facilities.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water safety** is a concern in some areas, with many households relying on alternative sources, such as wells and springs, for their drinking water.
- **Sanitation coverage** remains low, particularly in rural areas, where access to improved sanitation facilities is limited.
- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on traditional sources, such as rivers and lakes, for their water needs.
- The government has launched initiatives to **improve water supply** and sanitation services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and distribution systems.
- **Community-based initiatives** are being promoted to support the development of water and sanitation services, including the construction of latrines and promotion of hygiene practices.
