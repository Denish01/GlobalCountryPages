# Ethiopia Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's culture is a rich and diverse tapestry, woven from the threads of its long history, geographic location, and the interactions of its many ethnic and linguistic groups. With over 80 ethnic groups and more than 200 languages spoken, Ethiopia is a true melting pot of cultures. The **Amhara** and **Oromo** peoples are the two largest ethnic groups, and their languages, **Amharic** and **Oromiffa**, are widely spoken. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean has also had a profound impact on its culture, with influences from Christianity, Islam, and traditional African religions all evident.

Ethiopia's cultural identity is also deeply rooted in its history, with the ancient **Kingdom of Axum** and the **Solomonic dynasty** playing important roles in shaping the country's art, architecture, and literature. The **Ethiopian Orthodox Church** has also had a profound impact on the country's culture, with its unique blend of Christian and traditional African practices. The church's influence can be seen in the many **rock-hewn churches** and **monasteries** that dot the countryside, as well as in the vibrant **icon paintings** and **illuminated manuscripts** that are a hallmark of Ethiopian art.

Despite the many influences that have shaped Ethiopia's culture, the country remains a distinct and vibrant entity, with a strong sense of national identity and a deep connection to its history and traditions. From the bustling streets of **Addis Ababa** to the rural villages and towns, Ethiopia is a country that is proud of its heritage and eager to share it with the world.
