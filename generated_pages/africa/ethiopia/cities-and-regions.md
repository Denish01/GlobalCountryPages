[SECTION] How Ethiopia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Ethiopia is a sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa, divided into 10 states and 2 chartered cities. The administrative structure is based on a federal system, with the states having a significant degree of autonomy. The states are further divided into zones, which are then divided into districts, known as woredas. This system allows for a decentralized approach to governance, taking into account the country's diverse cultural, linguistic, and geographical characteristics. The 10 states are Afar, Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambela, Harari, Oromia, Sidama, Somali, South West Ethiopia Peoples, and Tigray.

The two chartered cities, Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, are self-governing and are not part of any state. Addis Ababa, the capital city, serves as the country's economic, cultural, and political hub. The federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and national economic policy, while the states have control over matters such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. This division of power allows for a balance between national unity and regional autonomy.
