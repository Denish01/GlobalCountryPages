[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's population is rapidly growing, with an estimated 2.7% annual growth rate, making it one of the fastest-growing populations in the world. The country's population size is significant, with approximately 126 million people, which is roughly 1.5% of the world's population. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 18.5 years, and is expected to continue growing due to a high fertility rate of 4.3 children per woman. Urbanization is also on the rise, with approximately 20.5% of the population living in urban areas, with Addis Ababa being the largest city.

The population growth trend in Ethiopia is expected to continue, with the population projected to reach 150 million by 2030. The country's population is also experiencing a significant shift towards urbanization, with many people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. However, this rapid urbanization is also putting a strain on the country's infrastructure and resources. The government is working to address these challenges by investing in urban planning and development, as well as implementing policies to promote sustainable population growth.

Ethiopia's population is also characterized by significant migration patterns, with many people moving within the country or to neighboring countries in search of work or refuge. The country has a long history of migration, with many Ethiopians moving to other parts of Africa, the Middle East, or Europe in search of better economic opportunities. However, the country is also home to many refugees and asylum seekers, with over 700,000 registered refugees living in the country.
