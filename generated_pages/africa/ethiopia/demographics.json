The country's population size is significant, with approximately 126 million people, which is roughly 1.5% of the world's population. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 18.5 years, and is expected to continue growing due to a high fertility rate of 4.3 children per woman. Urbanization is also on the rise, with approximately 20.5% of the population living in urban areas, with Addis Ababa being the largest city.\n\nThe population growth trend in Ethiopia is expected to continue, with the population projected to reach 150 million by 2030. The country's population is also experiencing a significant shift towards urbanization, with many people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. However, this rapid urbanization is also putting a strain on the country's infrastructure and resources. The government is working to address these challenges by investing in urban planning and development, as well as implementing policies to promote sustainable population growth.\n\nEthiopia's population is also characterized by significant migration patterns, with many people moving within the country or to neighboring countries in search of work or refuge. The country has a long history of migration, with many Ethiopians moving to other parts of Africa, the Middle East, or Europe in search of better economic opportunities. However, the country is also home to many refugees and asylum seekers, with over 700,000 registered refugees living in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Oromo | 34.5% | Central and southern regions | Largest ethnic group |\n| Amhara | 27.0% | Northern and central regions | Traditionally dominant group |\n| Somali | 6.2% | Eastern region | Predominantly Muslim |\n| Tigrinya | 6.1% | Northern region | Historically influential group |\n| Sidama | 4.0% | Southern region | Significant agricultural producers |\n| Gurage | 2.5% | Central region | Known for their rich cultural heritage |\n| Afar | 2.2% | Eastern region | Traditional pastoralists |\n| Hadiya | 1.7% | Southern region | Significant coffee producers |\n[/TABLE]\nEthiopia is home to over 80 ethnic groups, with the Oromo being the largest group, making up approximately 34.5% of the population.
