[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's economy is classified as a low-income economy, with a large portion of its population engaged in subsistence farming. The country has been experiencing rapid economic growth over the past decade, with an average annual GDP growth rate of around 8%. This growth has been driven by a combination of factors, including government investment in infrastructure, a growing services sector, and a significant increase in foreign investment. Despite this growth, Ethiopia still faces significant development challenges, including a large trade deficit and a reliance on a few key export commodities.

Ethiopia's economic development level is still relatively low, with a significant portion of its population living below the poverty line. However, the government has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting economic development and reducing poverty, including the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). The GTP aims to promote rapid and sustainable economic growth, while also reducing poverty and improving living standards. The plan focuses on a number of key sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services, and aims to promote private sector growth and investment.

Ethiopia's economic trajectory is expected to continue to be driven by a combination of government investment and private sector growth. The government has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting investment and trade, including the creation of a number of industrial parks and the establishment of a one-stop shop for investors. The country has also made significant progress in improving its business environment, including the introduction of a new commercial code and the establishment of a number of specialized courts.
