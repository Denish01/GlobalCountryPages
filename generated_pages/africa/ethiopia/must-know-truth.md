# The Truth About Ethiopia - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Ethiopia, located in the **Horn of Africa**, has a rich and diverse history that spans over 3,000 years. The **Kingdom of D'mt**, established in the 10th century BCE, is considered one of the earliest known kingdoms in the region. In the 1st century CE, the **Kingdom of Axum** rose to power, becoming a major center of trade and commerce. The kingdom's strategic location allowed it to control the **Red Sea** trade routes, making it a significant player in the ancient world.

In the 4th century CE, **Christianity** was introduced to Ethiopia, and it became the official state religion. The **Solomonic dynasty**, which ruled from the 13th to the 20th century, claimed descent from the biblical **King Solomon** and the **Queen of Sheba**. This dynasty played a significant role in shaping Ethiopia's history, culture, and identity. In the 19th century, Ethiopia faced **European colonization**, with Italy attempting to occupy the country. However, Ethiopia successfully resisted Italian rule, except for a brief period from 1936 to 1941, when it was occupied during the **Second Italo-Abyssinian War**.

Ethiopia gained its independence on May 5, 1941, after the **British** helped liberate the country from Italian occupation. The **Derg**, a Marxist-Leninist military junta, ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1987, implementing a series of socialist policies and nationalizing industries. In 1991, the **Ethiopian People's Democratic Republic** was established, marking the beginning of a new era of democratic governance. Today, Ethiopia is a **federal parliamentary republic**, with a diverse population and a growing economy.

The country's history is characterized by periods of **empire building**, **foreign invasion**, and **regional conflict**. The **Ethiopian Empire**, which existed from the 13th to the 20th century, was a major power in the region, with a complex system of government, economy, and culture. The empire's legacy continues to shape Ethiopia's identity and inform its relationships with neighboring countries.
