[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Ethiopia is located in the **Horn of Africa**, a region in the eastern part of the continent. It is a landlocked country, meaning it does not have any direct access to the ocean. Ethiopia is bordered by six countries: Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west, and Sudan to the northwest. The country's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange in the region.

Ethiopia's borders are defined by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries. The **Great Rift Valley**, a geological fault line that runs from Lebanon to Mozambique, passes through the center of the country, creating a natural divide between the highlands and the lowlands. The country's borders have been shaped by its complex history, with various empires and kingdoms rising and falling over the centuries. Today, Ethiopia is a sovereign state with a diverse population and a rich cultural heritage.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, from the **highlands** in the north to the **deserts** in the east. The highlands, which include the **Simien Mountains National Park**, are home to some of the country's most spectacular scenery, with steep cliffs, deep valleys, and towering peaks. The highlands are also home to many of Ethiopia's major cities, including the capital, **Addis Ababa**. The lowlands, which include the **Danakil Depression**, are much hotter and drier, with temperatures often reaching 45 degrees Celsius in the summer.

The country's landscape is also defined by its many **rivers**, including the **Blue Nile**, which flows through the highlands and into Sudan. The Blue Nile is an important source of water and electricity for Ethiopia, and its waters are harnessed by the **Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam**, one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world. Ethiopia's **forests**, which cover about 15% of the country, are also an important part of its ecosystem, providing habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including elephants, lions, and leopards.

The **Great Rift Valley** also plays a significant role in shaping Ethiopia's landscape, with its many **lakes** and **volcanoes**. **Lake Tana**, the source of the Blue Nile, is the largest lake in the country, and is home to a wide range of aquatic life, including fish, crocodiles, and hippos. The **Erta Ale volcano**, which is located in the Danakil Depression, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, and is known for its **lava lake**, which has been erupting continuously since 1967.
