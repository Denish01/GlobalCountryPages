The cost of utilities in Ethiopia can be volatile, with frequent price increases due to inflation and other economic factors. The inflation rate in Ethiopia was 21.0% in 2024, which can significantly impact the cost of living, including utilities. Seasonal variation also plays a role, with higher electricity costs during the dry season due to increased demand for water pumping and irrigation.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure varies across different regions in Ethiopia, with urban areas like Addis Ababa generally having better access to reliable electricity, water, and sanitation services. However, rural areas often struggle with limited access to these basic services, and the cost of utilities can be higher due to the lack of economies of scale. As a result, the cost of utilities in Ethiopia can fluctuate greatly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have lower costs compared to rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | mainly used for cooking |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in rent or paid separately |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$85** | **$120** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $10-20 | 10-20 Mbps | Ethio Telecom, Zain |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $25-50 | 50-100 Mbps | Ethio Telecom, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-15 | 1-10 GB | Ethio Telecom, Zain |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-30 | 5-20 GB | Ethio Telecom, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $20-50 | varies | Ethio Telecom, Zain |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Ethio Telecom's streaming service) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Ethiopia, you typically need to visit the local utility office and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely used in Ethiopia, and they can help you save money by avoiding estimated billing.\n- Ethio Telecom and Zain are two of the major internet service providers in Ethiopia, offering a range of plans and packages.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or walking instead of driving.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with your landlord or property manager to see if they can include utilities in the rent or provide a discount for long-term leases.",
