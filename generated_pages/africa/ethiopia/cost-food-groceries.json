However, the **inflation rate** of 21.0% in 2024 has driven up prices, making it essential to budget accordingly. The eating-out culture in Ethiopia is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home. This is partly due to the fact that eating out can be expensive, especially in mid-range and fine dining restaurants. On the other hand, home cooking allows for more flexibility and affordability, with ingredients readily available at local markets.\n\nThe cost of food in Ethiopia is influenced by various factors, including the **GDP per capita PPP** of $3,288, which is relatively low compared to other countries. The **health expenditure per capita** of $35 and **education spend** of 2.3% of GDP also impact the overall cost of living, including food prices. Additionally, the country's **agricultural sector** plays a significant role in determining food prices, with many staple crops such as **teff**, **wheat**, and **barley** being locally produced.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 45 ETB | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 15 ETB | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 36 ETB | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 30 ETB | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 105 ETB | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00 | 150 ETB | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.00 | 60 ETB | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 45 ETB | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 24 ETB | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 18 ETB | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 120 ETB | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50 | 15 ETB | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | (injera with stews) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | (one person) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$30 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | (upscale) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Ethiopia can be significant, with supermarkets generally being more expensive.
