  "content": "Ethiopia's infrastructure is rapidly developing, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications, although gaps remain between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 44% of population\nInternet Penetration: 15%\nRoad Network: 110,000 km, with moderate quality and ongoing upgrades\nRail Network: 794 km, with plans for expansion\nMajor Airports: 3 international, 15 domestic\nMajor Ports: 2, via neighboring Djibouti\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nEthiopia's infrastructure development level is steadily improving, driven by government initiatives and foreign investment. The country has made significant strides in recent years, with a focus on upgrading its transportation networks, increasing access to electricity, and expanding telecommunications services. However, a notable urban-rural gap persists, with cities like Addis Ababa and Hawassa enjoying relatively better infrastructure than rural areas. The government has launched various development plans, including the Growth and Transformation Plan, to address these disparities and promote economic growth.\n\nEthiopia's infrastructure sector has attracted significant investment from international partners, including China, the United States, and the European Union. These investments have supported the development of major infrastructure projects, such as the construction of new highways, railways, and energy generation facilities. Despite these efforts, the country still faces challenges in providing adequate infrastructure services to its rapidly growing population.\n\nThe government has recognized the importance of infrastructure development in driving economic growth and has prioritized investments in this sector. However, the pace of progress remains uneven, and more work is needed to address the significant infrastructure gaps that exist, particularly in rural areas. Ongoing efforts to improve governance, increase private sector participation, and enhance regional cooperation are expected to support the development of Ethiopia's infrastructure sector.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 110,000 km | Moderate | Ongoing upgrades, including construction of new highways |\n| Railways | 794 km | Good | Plans for expansion, including a new railway line to Djibouti |\n| Airports | 3 international, 15 domestic | Good | Modernization of airport facilities, including Addis Ababa's Bole International Airport |\n| Ports | 2, via neighboring Djibouti | Moderate | Plans to develop a new port facility in Djibouti |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Hydroelectric power** is the primary source of electricity generation, with several major dams, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, under construction or in operation.\n- The **reliability of electricity supply** remains a challenge, with frequent outages reported in some areas, particularly during periods of high demand.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as wind and solar power, are becoming increasingly important, with several projects under development to support the country's energy mix.\n- The government has launched initiatives to **improve energy efficiency** and reduce energy losses in the transmission and distribution systems.\n- **Private sector participation** is being encouraged to support the development of the energy sector, including the construction of new power generation facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in some areas, with many households relying on alternative sources, such as wells and springs, for their drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** remains low, particularly in rural areas, where access to improved sanitation facilities is limited.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on traditional sources, such as rivers and lakes, for their water needs.\n- The government has launched initiatives to **improve water supply** and sanitation services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and distribution systems.\n- **Community-based initiatives** are being promoted to support the development of water and sanitation services, including the construction of latrines and promotion of hygiene practices.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** has expanded significantly in recent years, with several operators providing services across the country.\n- **Fiber optic networks** are being developed to support the growth of broadband services, including internet and data transmission.\n- The **4G network** is being rolled out in major cities, with plans to expand coverage to other areas.\n- **Postal services** are being modernized, with a focus on improving the efficiency and reliability of mail delivery.\n- **Internet penetration** remains relatively low, although it is increasing, driven by the growth of mobile broadband services and the development of new internet exchange points.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam** is a major hydroelectric dam under construction on the Blue Nile River, which will provide significant new power generation capacity.\n- The **Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway** is a new railway line under construction, which will provide a vital transportation link between Ethiopia and the port of Djibouti.\n- The **Ethiopia-Djibouti Pipeline** is a new pipeline project under development, which will transport fuel from the port of Djibouti to Addis Ababa.\n- The **Growth and Transformation Plan** is a government initiative aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including through investments in infrastructure.\n- The **African Development Bank** is providing funding and technical support for several infrastructure projects in Ethiopia, including the development of new roads and energy generation facilities.",
