[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia has a **territorial taxation system**, where residents are taxed on their Ethiopian-sourced income, while non-residents are taxed on their worldwide income. Residency for tax purposes is determined by the individual's physical presence in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year. The Ethiopian tax system is governed by the Income Tax Proclamation and the Value Added Tax Proclamation, which provide the framework for taxation in the country.

The tax system in Ethiopia is designed to promote economic growth and development, while also ensuring that individuals and businesses contribute to the country's revenue. The government has implemented various tax incentives and exemptions to encourage investment and trade, particularly in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Additionally, Ethiopia has a **double taxation avoidance agreement** with several countries, which helps to prevent individuals and businesses from being taxed twice on the same income.
