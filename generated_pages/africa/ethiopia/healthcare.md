[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's healthcare system is structured into three main tiers: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. The primary level includes health posts and health centers, while the secondary level comprises district and general hospitals, and the tertiary level consists of specialized hospitals. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, but private providers are increasingly common, especially in urban areas. The quality of care varies significantly between public and private facilities, with private hospitals generally offering better equipment, staff, and services. Urban areas, such as Addis Ababa, have relatively better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where facilities and trained personnel are scarce.

The Ethiopian government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a health extension program, which aims to provide basic health services to rural communities. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to essential medicines. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system and implementing policies to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.

Despite these challenges, Ethiopia has made progress in reducing child mortality rates, improving maternal health, and increasing access to HIV/AIDS treatment. The government has also implemented initiatives to strengthen the healthcare system, including the development of a national health policy and a healthcare financing strategy. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality, particularly in rural areas.
