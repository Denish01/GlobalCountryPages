  "content": "Ethiopia is generally cheaper than South Sudan, with a cost of living that is approximately 30-40% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEthiopia GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,244\nSouth Sudan GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,655\nEthiopia Inflation Rate: 20.8%\nSouth Sudan Inflation Rate: 37.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Ethiopia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Ethiopia vs South Sudan [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Ethiopia and South Sudan varies significantly, with Ethiopia being the more affordable option. Ethiopia has a larger and more diverse economy, with a growing manufacturing sector and a strong agricultural industry. In contrast, South Sudan's economy is largely dependent on oil exports and has been affected by years of conflict and instability. As a result, the cost of living in South Sudan is higher, with prices for basic goods and services often inflated due to supply chain disruptions and limited infrastructure.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Ethiopia has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, transportation, and communication systems, which helps to keep costs lower. In addition, Ethiopia has a larger and more competitive market, with many local and international businesses operating in the country. This competition helps to drive down prices and improve the quality of goods and services. In contrast, South Sudan's economy is more isolated, with limited access to international markets and a lack of competition, which can drive up prices.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 150 | 300 | 50% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 80 | 200 | 60% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 500 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 30 | 60 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 40 | 50% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Ethiopia (USD) | South Sudan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 300 | 500 | 40% |\n| Mid-Range | 600 | 1,000 | 40% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 2,000 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Ethiopia is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 60% lower than in South Sudan\n- Food and dining, with meal prices up to 50% lower than in South Sudan\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices up to 50% lower than in South Sudan\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 50% lower than in South Sudan\n- **South Sudan is cheaper for:**\n- Limited categories, as Ethiopia is generally the more affordable option\n- However, South Sudan may offer more job opportunities in certain fields, such as oil and gas\n- South Sudan may also offer more opportunities for entrepreneurial ventures, particularly in the areas of agriculture and trade\n- Additionally, South Sudan may have more lenient regulations and laws, which can make it easier to start and operate a business\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Ethiopia is generally the better value, with a lower cost of living and a more developed infrastructure.
