[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nEthiopia has a complex geography, with different climate zones, including tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. The country has two main seasons: the dry season, which runs from October to June, and the wet season, which runs from July to September. The dry season is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F), making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, on the other hand, is marked by heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving up to 2,000 mm (79 in) of rain during this period. The rains can make some roads impassable, and the crowds can be overwhelming, especially during the Ethiopian Orthodox Christmas in January.\n\nThe seasons in Ethiopia also affect the travel experience, with the dry season being the best time for trekking, sightseeing, and outdoor activities. The wet season, while not ideal for outdoor activities, is a great time to see the country's lush green landscapes and experience the local culture. The seasons also impact the availability of accommodations and tour services, with prices tend to be higher during the peak season.\n\nThe highlands of Ethiopia, which include the Simien Mountains National Park and the Bale Mountains National Park, have a unique climate, with cooler temperatures and more rainfall than the rest of the country. The lowlands, on the other hand, are generally hotter and drier, with temperatures often reaching 40°C (104°F) during the day. Understanding the different climate zones and seasons in Ethiopia is essential for planning a successful trip to the country.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and dry | High | $$$ | Trekking, sightseeing, Ethiopian Orthodox Christmas |\n| February | Mild and dry | Med | $$ | Wildlife watching, cultural festivals |\n| March | Warm and dry | Low | $ | Trekking, hiking, outdoor activities |\n| April | Hot and dry | Low | $ | Visiting the lowlands, outdoor activities |\n| May | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | Visiting the highlands, trekking, hiking |\n| June | Warm and dry | Med | $$ | Visiting the historical sites, cultural festivals |\n| July | Hot and wet | Low | $ | Visiting the lowlands, experiencing local culture |\n| August | Hot and wet | Low | $ | Visiting the highlands, trekking, hiking |\n| September | Warm and wet | Med | $$ | Visiting the historical sites, cultural festivals |\n| October | Mild and dry | Med | $$ | Trekking, sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| November | Cool and dry | Med | $$ | Wildlife watching, cultural festivals |\n| December | Cool and dry | High | $$$ | Trekking, sightseeing, Ethiopian Orthodox Christmas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethiopian Orthodox Christmas | January | A major Christian holiday in Ethiopia, celebrated with processions, music, and traditional food |\n| Timkat | January | A colorful festival celebrating the Epiphany, with parades, music, and traditional dances |\n| Ethiopian New Year | September | A celebration of the Ethiopian New Year, with traditional food, music, and dancing |\n| Irreecha | September | A thanksgiving festival, celebrated by the Oromo people, with traditional music, dancing, and food |\n| Hidar Tsion | November | A celebration of the **Ark of the Covenant**, with processions, music, and traditional food |\n| Ganna | January | A traditional Ethiopian Christmas, celebrated with traditional food, music, and dancing |\n| Enkutatesh | September | A celebration of the Ethiopian New Year, with traditional food, music, and dancing |\n| Kulubi Gabriel | December | A celebration of Saint Gabriel, with processions, music, and traditional food |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Simien Mountains National Park** has a unique climate, with cooler temperatures and more rainfall than the rest of the country, making it best to visit from October to June.\n- The **Bale Mountains National Park** has a similar climate to the Simien Mountains, with cooler temperatures and more rainfall, making it best to visit from October to June.\n- The **Omo Valley** has a hot and dry climate, with temperatures often reaching 40°C (104°F) during the day, making it best to visit from October to May.\n- The **Danakil Depression** has a very hot and dry climate, with temperatures often reaching 45°C (113°F) during the day, making it best to visit from October to May.\n- The **highlands** have a cooler climate, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F), making it best to visit from October to June.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tour services well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to May, when prices are lower and the crowds are smaller.\n- Pack **weather gear**, such as sunscreen, hats, and umbrellas, to protect yourself from the sun and rain.\n- Avoid visiting during the Ethiopian Orthodox Christmas in January, as the crowds can be overwhelming and the prices are higher.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or joining a tour group to get the most out of your trip and to experience the local culture.\n- Respect the local customs and traditions, especially when visiting **churches and monasteries**, by dressing modestly and removing your shoes.",
