[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's utility infrastructure has been improving over the years, but it still faces challenges in terms of reliability and accessibility. The cost of utilities in Ethiopia can be volatile, with frequent price increases due to inflation and other economic factors. The inflation rate in Ethiopia was 21.0% in 2024, which can significantly impact the cost of living, including utilities. Seasonal variation also plays a role, with higher electricity costs during the dry season due to increased demand for water pumping and irrigation.

The quality of utility infrastructure varies across different regions in Ethiopia, with urban areas like Addis Ababa generally having better access to reliable electricity, water, and sanitation services. However, rural areas often struggle with limited access to these basic services, and the cost of utilities can be higher due to the lack of economies of scale. As a result, the cost of utilities in Ethiopia can fluctuate greatly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have lower costs compared to rural areas.
