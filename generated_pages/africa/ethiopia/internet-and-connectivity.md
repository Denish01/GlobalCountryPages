[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Ethiopia has undergone significant improvements in recent years, but it still lags behind many other countries in terms of speed and reliability. The average internet speed is around 5 Mbps, which can be frustrating for users who are accustomed to faster speeds. However, this speed is still sufficient for basic tasks such as browsing, emailing, and social media. The main challenge is the urban vs rural divide, where urban areas like Addis Ababa tend to have better internet connectivity than rural areas. In rural areas, the internet can be slow and unreliable, making it difficult for users to stay connected.

The reliability of the internet in Ethiopia can also be a challenge, with frequent outages and disruptions to service. This can be frustrating for users who rely on the internet for work or communication. However, the government has been investing in the development of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, which is expected to improve the quality and reliability of the internet in the coming years. Despite the challenges, the internet is still an essential tool for many Ethiopians, and it has the potential to play a significant role in the country's economic and social development.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Ethiopia is relatively straightforward, with several mobile providers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers are Ethio Telecom, Safaricom, and Orange, which offer a range of plans to suit different needs and budgets. To get a SIM card, users will need to provide their passport and a copy of their visa, as well as fill out a registration form. SIM cards can be purchased at mobile provider stores, as well as at many retail outlets and kiosks. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, which includes a certain amount of data and airtime.

The recommended carriers for tourists are Ethio Telecom and Safaricom, which offer a range of plans with different data allowances and prices. For example, Ethio Telecom's tourist plan includes 1 GB of data and 10 minutes of airtime for around 5 USD. Safaricom's plan includes 2 GB of data and 20 minutes of airtime for around 10 USD. It's worth noting that data speeds can vary greatly depending on the location, so it's a good idea to check the coverage and speed in the areas you plan to visit before purchasing a SIM card.
