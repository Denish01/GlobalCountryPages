The government has been actively promoting foreign investment, particularly in priority sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, and construction. However, the country's bureaucratic processes can be slow and cumbersome, and corruption remains a significant issue. The government has implemented various reforms to improve the business climate, including the establishment of a one-stop shop for investors and the introduction of a new investment law.
