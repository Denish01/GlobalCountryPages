Ethiopia has a lower overall cost of living, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being relatively lower compared to Sudan. The economic context of the two countries also plays a role, with Ethiopia experiencing rapid economic growth in recent years, while Sudan has faced significant economic challenges, including high inflation and a large trade deficit. As a result, Ethiopia is generally the better option for those looking for an affordable place to live, with costs around 15-20% lower than in Sudan.\n\nThe cost of living in Ethiopia and Sudan can vary depending on the specific location, with cities like Addis Ababa and Khartoum tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. However, overall, Ethiopia offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a wide range of accommodation options, a vibrant food scene, and a relatively low cost of transportation. Sudan, on the other hand, has a more limited range of accommodation options, and the cost of food and transportation can be relatively high. Despite these differences, both countries offer a unique and rewarding experience for expats, students, and travelers, with a rich cultural heritage and a warm welcoming atmosphere.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 350 | 42% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Ethiopia (USD) | Sudan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Ethiopia is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in Sudan\n- Food and dining, with meal prices up to 50% lower than in Sudan\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices up to 50% lower than in Sudan\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 50% lower than in Sudan\n\n- **Sudan is cheaper for:**\n- Some imported goods, which can be up to 20% cheaper than in Ethiopia\n- Certain types of accommodation, such as luxury apartments, which can be up to 10% cheaper than in Ethiopia\n- Some tourist activities, such as desert safaris, which can be up to 15% cheaper than in Ethiopia\n- Certain types of food, such as meat and seafood, which can be up to 10% cheaper than in Ethiopia\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nEthiopia offers a more affordable lifestyle than Sudan, with lower prices for housing, food, transportation, and utilities.
