[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Ethiopia are generally lower compared to the regional average, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant costing around $3 USD. However, the **inflation rate** of 21.0% in 2024 has driven up prices, making it essential to budget accordingly. The eating-out culture in Ethiopia is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home. This is partly due to the fact that eating out can be expensive, especially in mid-range and fine dining restaurants. On the other hand, home cooking allows for more flexibility and affordability, with ingredients readily available at local markets.

The cost of food in Ethiopia is influenced by various factors, including the **GDP per capita PPP** of $3,288, which is relatively low compared to other countries.
