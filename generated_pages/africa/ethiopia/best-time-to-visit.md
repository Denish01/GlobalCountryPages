[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia has a complex geography, with different climate zones, including tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. The country has two main seasons: the dry season, which runs from October to June, and the wet season, which runs from July to September. The dry season is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F), making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, on the other hand, is marked by heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving up to 2,000 mm (79 in) of rain during this period. The rains can make some roads impassable, and the crowds can be overwhelming, especially during the Ethiopian Orthodox Christmas in January.

The seasons in Ethiopia also affect the travel experience, with the dry season being the best time for trekking, sightseeing, and outdoor activities. The wet season, while not ideal for outdoor activities, is a great time to see the country's lush green landscapes and experience the local culture. The seasons also impact the availability of accommodations and tour services, with prices tend to be higher during the peak season.

The highlands of Ethiopia, which include the Simien Mountains National Park and the Bale Mountains National Park, have a unique climate, with cooler temperatures and more rainfall than the rest of the country. The lowlands, on the other hand, are generally hotter and drier, with temperatures often reaching 40°C (104°F) during the day. Understanding the different climate zones and seasons in Ethiopia is essential for planning a successful trip to the country.
