Ethiopia has a more diversified economy, with a growing manufacturing sector and a large agricultural industry, which contributes to its relatively higher GDP per capita. In contrast, Somalia's economy is still recovering from years of conflict and instability, with a smaller and more fragile economy. As a result, Ethiopia tends to have a lower cost of living, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation generally lower than in Somalia.\n\nThe cost of living difference between the two countries is significant, with Ethiopia offering better value for money for expats, students, and retirees. However, Somalia has its own unique advantages, such as a lower cost of living in certain categories, like transportation and internet. Overall, the cost of living in Ethiopia is approximately 20-30% lower than in Somalia, making it a more attractive destination for those looking for an affordable lifestyle in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 100 | 180 | 44% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 300 | 500 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 4 | 50% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Ethiopia (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Ethiopia (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 300 | 500 | 40% |\n| Mid-Range | 600 | 1,000 | 40% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 2,000 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Ethiopia is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in Somalia\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries up to 50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices up to 50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with bills up to 37% cheaper\n- **Somalia is cheaper for:**\n- Certain categories of groceries, like fresh produce and meat\n- Local transportation, like buses and minivans\n- Mobile phone plans, with some operators offering cheaper rates\n- Traditional clothing and handicrafts, with lower prices than in Ethiopia\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nEthiopia offers better value for money for expats, students, and retirees, with a lower cost of living and a more diversified economy.
