[SECTION] Overview: Ethiopia vs South Sudan [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Ethiopia and South Sudan varies significantly, with Ethiopia being the more affordable option. Ethiopia has a larger and more diverse economy, with a growing manufacturing sector and a strong agricultural industry. In contrast, South Sudan's economy is largely dependent on oil exports and has been affected by years of conflict and instability. As a result, the cost of living in South Sudan is higher, with prices for basic goods and services often inflated due to supply chain disruptions and limited infrastructure.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Ethiopia has a more developed infrastructure, with better roads, transportation, and communication systems, which helps to keep costs lower. In addition, Ethiopia has a larger and more competitive market, with many local and international businesses operating in the country. This competition helps to drive down prices and improve the quality of goods and services. In contrast, South Sudan's economy is more isolated, with limited access to international markets and a lack of competition, which can drive up prices.
