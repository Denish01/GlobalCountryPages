[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nEthiopia has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of about 40 countries, including Kenya, Djibouti, and Sudan, can enter Ethiopia visa-free, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an e-visa system. The Ethiopian government has been working to simplify its visa process and attract more tourists and business travelers to the country.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism, trade, and investment. The Ethiopian government has introduced an e-visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to apply for a visa online before their trip. This system has made it easier for travelers to obtain a visa and has reduced the processing time.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist Visa | 30-90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| UK Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist Visa | 30-90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist Visa | 30-90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Canadian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist Visa | 30-90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Australian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist Visa | 30-90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30-90 days | Must apply for a visa at an Ethiopian embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30-90 days | Must apply for a visa at an Ethiopian embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Ethiopia for up to 90 days, depending on the type of visa they obtain.
