[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Ethiopia's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. The quality of education in public schools is generally considered to be lower than in private schools, due to limited resources and infrastructure. The language of instruction in Ethiopian schools is **Amharic**, although English is also widely used, particularly in secondary and higher education. Compulsory education in Ethiopia lasts for 8 years, from age 7 to 14, and is free for all citizens. International schools are also available in major cities like Addis Ababa, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**.

The education system in Ethiopia has undergone significant reforms in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to education and improving the quality of teaching. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of educational infrastructure, teacher training, and resources. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, with better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a higher cost. These schools are popular among expatriates and wealthy Ethiopians who can afford the tuition fees.
