  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Cabo Verde can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with the overall health expenditure per capita being around $290.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $290\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 25.7%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 130\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: CVE\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nCabo Verde has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private sector, but it is more affordable for locals. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred choice due to its higher standard of care and wider range of services available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded, which can lead to long waiting times and a shortage of medical supplies. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics are well-equipped and offer a higher level of care, but at a significantly higher cost. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare.\n\nThe healthcare system in Cabo Verde is organized into three levels of care: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary care is provided by health centers and clinics, which offer basic medical services such as consultations, vaccinations, and minor surgeries. Secondary care is provided by hospitals, which offer more specialized services such as emergency care, surgery, and hospitalization. Tertiary care is provided by specialized hospitals and clinics, which offer advanced medical services such as cancer treatment, cardiac surgery, and neurosurgery. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek private healthcare services, which can be more expensive but offer a higher level of care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have long waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private clinics may require an appointment |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dentists may offer more advanced services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Private optometrists may offer more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have long waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private clinics may offer more advanced equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more personalized care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may offer faster results |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private hospital care, specialist consultations, advanced medical services |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, advanced medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antihistamines can cost between $5-$10\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and brand\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas\n- It is recommended to bring any prescription medication with you when traveling to Cabo Verde, as availability may be limited\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 130 or seek immediate attention at a hospital.
