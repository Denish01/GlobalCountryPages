  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nCabo Verde, located off the coast of West Africa, has a unique history that spans over five centuries. The **uninhabited islands** were discovered by the Portuguese in 1462, and by the early 16th century, the Portuguese had established the first permanent settlements. The islands' strategic location made them an important stopover for ships traveling between Europe, Africa, and the Americas. As a result, Cabo Verde became a major hub for the **transatlantic slave trade**, with thousands of enslaved Africans passing through the islands on their way to the Americas.\n\nIn the 19th century, Cabo Verde's economy began to shift towards **agriculture** and **fishing**, with the islands becoming a major producer of crops such as sugarcane, coffee, and cotton. However, the islands' economy was heavily dependent on Portugal, and the lack of investment and infrastructure hindered Cabo Verde's development. The **Cabo Verdean independence movement** began to gain momentum in the mid-20th century, with the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) leading the fight for independence.\n\nCabo Verde gained its independence from Portugal on July 5, 1975, after over 500 years of Portuguese rule. The country's first president, **Aristides Pereira**, played a key role in the independence movement and served as president from 1975 to 1991.
