[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Cabo Verde are generally higher than the regional average due to the country's island location and reliance on imports. The cost of living in Cabo Verde is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which affects the price of goods, including food. However, the country's **subsidized food program** helps to keep prices stable for staple foods such as rice, beans, and bread. Eating out is a popular culture in Cabo Verde, with many restaurants serving traditional dishes such as **catchupa** (a stew made with fish or meat, beans, and vegetables) and **arroz de peixe** (fish rice). However, home cooking is also common, and many people prefer to buy ingredients at local markets to prepare their own meals.

The food prices in Cabo Verde can fluctuate depending on the season, with prices tend to be higher during the peak tourist season. The government's efforts to promote **local agriculture** and reduce reliance on imports have helped to stabilize food prices and improve food security. Additionally, the country's **fishing industry** provides a steady supply of fresh seafood, which is a staple in many Cabo Verdean dishes. Overall, while food prices in Cabo Verde may be higher than in some other African countries, the quality and variety of food available make it a great destination for foodies and travelers alike.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Cabo Verde. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, but they offer a wider range of products, including imported goods. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and staple foods at lower prices, but the selection may be limited. It's recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported products. Bargaining is not common in supermarkets, but it's expected at local markets, where vendors may be willing to negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases.

In general, local markets offer a more authentic shopping experience, with vendors selling everything from fresh fish to handicrafts. The **Mercado de Praia** in the capital city is a great place to experience the sights and sounds of a local market, with a wide range of goods on offer. Supermarkets, on the other hand, are more convenient for tourists and expats, with many stores offering a range of international products. Some popular supermarket chains in Cabo Verde include **Supermercado** and **Mini Mercado**.
