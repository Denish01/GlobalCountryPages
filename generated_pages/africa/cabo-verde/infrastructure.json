  "content": "Cabo Verde's infrastructure is relatively well-developed compared to other countries in the region, with a focus on improving roads, increasing access to electricity and water, and expanding telecommunications services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 96.6% of population\nInternet Penetration: 58.2%\nRoad Network: 1,100 km, paved and unpaved roads with moderate quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nCabo Verde has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving the overall quality of life for its citizens. The government has invested heavily in upgrading the country's roads, expanding access to electricity and water, and improving telecommunications services. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity and clean water. Despite these challenges, Cabo Verde has made notable progress in recent years, with the country's infrastructure development level being considered one of the most advanced in West Africa.\n\nThe government of Cabo Verde has implemented several initiatives aimed at improving the country's infrastructure, including the development of a new national infrastructure plan. This plan aims to improve the country's roads, increase access to electricity and water, and expand telecommunications services. The plan also includes initiatives to improve the country's ports and airports, with the goal of increasing trade and economic growth. Overall, Cabo Verde's infrastructure is well-developed compared to other countries in the region, but there is still a need for continued investment and development to address the urban-rural gap and improve the overall quality of life for citizens.\n\nCabo Verde's infrastructure development has also been supported by international organizations and donors, who have provided significant funding and technical assistance to support the country's infrastructure development goals. For example, the World Bank has provided funding to support the development of Cabo Verde's roads and transportation infrastructure, while the European Union has provided funding to support the development of the country's energy and water sectors.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 1,100 km | Moderate | Paved and unpaved roads, with some roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 0 km | - | No rail network in Cabo Verde |\n| Airports | 4 international, 2 domestic | Good | Major airports include Sal, Boa Vista, and Praia |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | Major ports include Porto Grande and Mindelo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Cabo Verde's power generation is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a growing focus on **renewable energy** sources such as wind and solar power.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing access to electricity, with 96.6% of the population having access to electricity.\n- However, the country still experiences **power outages**, particularly during periods of high demand.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve the reliability of the power grid and reduce outages.\n- Cabo Verde has set a goal of generating 50% of its electricity from **renewable energy sources** by 2025, with a focus on wind and solar power.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Cabo Verde has made significant progress in increasing access to clean water, with 92% of the population having access to **improved water sources**.\n- However, the country still faces challenges in terms of **water scarcity**, particularly during periods of drought.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **water conservation** and reduce waste.\n- Sanitation coverage is also a challenge, with only 64% of the population having access to **improved sanitation facilities**.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve sanitation coverage, particularly in rural areas where access to sanitation facilities is limited.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Cabo Verde has a relatively well-developed telecommunications sector, with 58.2% of the population having access to the **internet**.\n- The country has a **mobile penetration rate** of over 100%, with multiple mobile operators providing services.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **broadband access**, particularly in rural areas where access to broadband services is limited.\n- Cabo Verde has also implemented initiatives to improve **postal services**, with a focus on increasing efficiency and reducing delivery times.\n- The country has also launched a **4G network**, with plans to expand coverage to all parts of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government of Cabo Verde has launched a major **infrastructure development project** aimed at improving the country's roads, ports, and airports.\n- The project, which is funded by the World Bank and other international donors, aims to improve the country's transportation infrastructure and increase trade and economic growth.\n- The government has also launched a **renewable energy project** aimed at increasing the country's use of renewable energy sources.\n- The project, which is funded by the European Union and other international donors, aims to increase the country's use of wind and solar power and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.\n- The government has also launched a **water and sanitation project** aimed at improving access to clean water and sanitation facilities, particularly in rural areas.",
