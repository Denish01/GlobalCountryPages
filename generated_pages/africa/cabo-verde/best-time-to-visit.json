Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to June. Avoid: July to October due to the hot and humid weather. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nCabo Verde has a tropical dry climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from November to June, is characterized by low humidity, mild temperatures, and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit the islands. The wet season, which runs from July to October, is hot and humid, with most of the country's annual rainfall occurring during these months. The climate varies across the different islands, with the northern islands being generally cooler and drier than the southern islands. The trade winds also play a significant role in shaping the climate, bringing cool air from the north and helping to moderate the temperatures.\n\nThe dry season is the best time to visit Cabo Verde, as the weather is pleasant and there are plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy, such as hiking, snorkeling, and whale watching. The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as the heat and humidity can be oppressive, and some tourist facilities may be closed. However, the wet season is also a time of great natural beauty, with the landscapes being lush and green, and the waterfalls being at their most spectacular.\n\nThe seasons also affect the travel crowd, with the peak season being from December to April, when the weather is at its best, and the crowds are at their largest. The budget season, which runs from May to June, is a good time to visit if you're looking for lower prices and smaller crowds. However, if you're looking for a more relaxed atmosphere, you may want to consider visiting during the shoulder season, which runs from November to December or from April to May.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Mild and dry | Low | $ | Hiking, snorkeling, and whale watching |\n| February | Mild and dry | Low | $ | Outdoor activities, such as hiking and biking |\n| March | Warm and dry | Med | $$ | Festivals, such as the Carnaval, and outdoor activities |\n| April | Warm and dry | Med | $$ | Water sports, such as surfing and kayaking |\n| May | Hot and dry | Low | $ | Relaxing on the beach, and enjoying water sports |\n| June | Hot and dry | Low | $ | Visiting the islands' interior, and enjoying the scenic landscapes |\n| July | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Visiting the waterfalls, and enjoying the lush landscapes |\n| August | Hot and humid | Med | $$ | Enjoying the summer festivals, and visiting the beaches |\n| September | Hot and humid | Med | $$ | Visiting the historic sites, and enjoying the cultural events |\n| October | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Visiting the islands' interior, and enjoying the scenic landscapes |\n| November | Mild and dry | Low | $ | Hiking, snorkeling, and whale watching |\n| December | Mild and dry | High | $$$ | Enjoying the peak season, and participating in the holiday festivities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Carnaval | February-March | A colorful and lively festival, with parades, music, and dancing |\n| Festival de Música | May-June | A music festival, featuring traditional and contemporary music |\n| Festa de São João | June | A festival celebrating the saint's day, with traditional food, music, and dancing |\n| Festival de Dança | July-August | A dance festival, featuring traditional and contemporary dance performances |\n| Festa de Nossa Senhora | August-September | A festival celebrating the patron saint, with processions, music, and dancing |\n| Festival de Gastronomia | October-November | A food festival, featuring traditional and contemporary cuisine |\n| Festa de Natal | December | A Christmas festival, with traditional food, music, and decorations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The northern islands, such as **Santo Antão** and **São Vicente**, have a cooler and drier climate than the southern islands, making them ideal for hiking and outdoor activities.\n- The southern islands, such as **Maio** and **Boa Vista**, have a hotter and more humid climate, making them ideal for beach activities and water sports.\n- The island of **Santiago** has a more varied climate, with a mix of dry and wet seasons, making it ideal for visiting the historic sites and enjoying the cultural events.\n- The island of **Fogo** has a unique climate, with a mix of tropical and subtropical conditions, making it ideal for visiting the volcano and enjoying the scenic landscapes.\n- The island of **Brava** has a cooler and more humid climate, making it ideal for hiking and enjoying the natural beauty of the island.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, when the weather is still pleasant, and the crowds are smaller.\n- Pack light and breathable clothing, as well as a light jacket for the cooler evenings.\n- Don't forget to bring sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses to protect yourself from the sun.\n- Be aware of the local holidays and festivals, and plan your trip accordingly, to avoid crowds and disruptions.\n- Consider renting a car or hiring a guide to explore the islands, as public transportation can be limited.",
