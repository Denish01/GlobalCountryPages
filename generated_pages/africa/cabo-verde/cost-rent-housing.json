The rental market is mostly concentrated in the capital city of Praia, where most of the country's population resides. Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract to avoid any disputes. Compared to its regional neighbors, Cabo Verde's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices similar to those in other West African countries.\n\nThe housing market in Cabo Verde is also influenced by the country's economy, which is growing steadily due to investments in tourism and other sectors. The government has implemented policies to encourage foreign investment and development, which has led to an increase in the construction of new housing units, particularly in the capital city. However, the demand for housing still outstrips supply, especially in the city center, which can drive up prices. Despite this, Cabo Verde remains an attractive destination for expats and tourists, with a unique culture and stunning natural beauty.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | (typical quality, 20-30 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$600 | $250-$450 | (what to expect, 30-50 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $400-$700 | (family size, 50-80 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,200 | $600-$1,000 | (spacious, 80-120 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | (prime locations, sea views) |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | (residential areas, amenities nearby) |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | (if applicable, rural areas with limited amenities) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Praia de Gamboa**: a coastal neighborhood with stunning views, typical rent range $400-$700 per month, popular with expats and tourists.\n- **Plateau**: the city center, with easy access to amenities, typical rent range $500-$900 per month, a bustling area with a mix of old and new buildings.\n- **Achada Santo Antonio**: a residential neighborhood, typical rent range $300-$600 per month, known for its quiet streets and family-friendly atmosphere.\n- **Terra Branca**: a suburban neighborhood, typical rent range $250-$500 per month, with a more laid-back atmosphere and easy access to the beach.\n- **Vila Nova**: a newer neighborhood, typical rent range $350-$700 per month, with modern amenities and a growing expat community.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Cabo Verde [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable apartment or house.\n- Always inspect the property before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent, especially if you are renting a larger apartment or house.\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget.\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished ones, so be prepared to buy or rent furniture if necessary.",
