[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde's rental market is relatively small, but it is growing due to the country's increasing popularity as a tourist destination. The rental market is mostly concentrated in the capital city of Praia, where most of the country's population resides. Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract to avoid any disputes. Compared to its regional neighbors, Cabo Verde's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices similar to those in other West African countries.

The housing market in Cabo Verde is also influenced by the country's economy, which is growing steadily due to investments in tourism and other sectors. The government has implemented policies to encourage foreign investment and development, which has led to an increase in the construction of new housing units, particularly in the capital city. However, the demand for housing still outstrips supply, especially in the city center, which can drive up prices. Despite this, Cabo Verde remains an attractive destination for expats and tourists, with a unique culture and stunning natural beauty.
