Cabo Verde, a sovereign nation with a population of around 0.6 million, has a relatively low GDP per capita and inflation rate, contributing to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Mauritius, with a population of around 1.3 million, has a higher GDP per capita and inflation rate, resulting in a higher overall cost of living. The economic context of Cabo Verde is characterized by a growing tourism industry and a strategic location for international trade, while Mauritius has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on finance, technology, and tourism.\n\nThe cost of living in Cabo Verde is generally lower than in Mauritius, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper. However, Mauritius offers a more developed infrastructure and a higher standard of living, which may justify the higher costs for some expats and tourists. The difference in cost of living between the two countries can be attributed to various factors, including the economic context, government policies, and the level of development. For example, Cabo Verde's lower cost of living can be attributed to its lower labor costs, lower taxes, and lower prices for goods and services. On the other hand, Mauritius's higher cost of living can be attributed to its higher labor costs, higher taxes, and higher prices for goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cabo Verde (USD) | Mauritius (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 400 | 37% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 700 | 1,200 | 42% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cabo Verde (USD) | Mauritius (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 500 | 40% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cabo Verde (USD) | Mauritius (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cabo Verde (USD) | Mauritius (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Cabo Verde (USD) | Mauritius (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 2,000 | 40% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,500 | 43% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Cabo Verde is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in Mauritius\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices up to 33% lower and grocery prices up to 40% lower\n  - Transportation, with fuel prices up to 33% lower and taxi fares up to 50% lower\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices up to 40% lower for internet and up to 33% lower for utilities\n\n- **Mauritius is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end shopping and luxury goods, with prices up to 20% lower than in Cabo Verde\n  - International flights, with more frequent and affordable connections to Europe and Asia\n  - Healthcare, with a more developed and modern healthcare system\n  - Education, with a more developed and modern education system\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable island lifestyle, Cabo Verde offers a compelling option, with a lower cost of living and a more relaxed atmosphere.
