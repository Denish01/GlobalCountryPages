Prices have been rising, particularly in popular areas such as Praia, Sal, and Boa Vista, where demand for high-end properties and vacation homes is strong.

The government has implemented initiatives to promote sustainable tourism and economic development, which is expected to drive growth in the property market.

The price trajectory in Cabo Verde has been steadily increasing, with a growth rate of around 5-10% per annum over the past few years.
