The country is divided into 22 municipalities, which are further grouped into two geographical areas: the **Barlavento** (Windward) Islands and the **Sotavento** (Leeward) Islands. The Barlavento Islands include the islands of Santo Antão, São Vicente, Santa Luzia, São Nicolau, Sal, and Boa Vista, while the Sotavento Islands comprise the islands of Maio, Santiago, Fogo, and Brava. This division is primarily based on geographical characteristics and has implications for the country's economy, culture, and administrative structure.\n\nThe administrative structure of Cabo Verde is relatively decentralized, with each municipality having a significant degree of autonomy. This allows for more effective management of local affairs and a greater focus on regional development. The government has also established several regional development agencies to promote economic growth and improve living standards in the various islands. These efforts aim to reduce regional disparities and promote a more balanced development across the country.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Praia** (0.15M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Praia is the largest city in Cabo Verde and serves as the country's capital.
