[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde's healthcare system is structured into three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the private sector is also well-established, with many private clinics and hospitals, especially in the capital city of Praia. The quality of care in Cabo Verde is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where facilities and resources may be limited.

The government of Cabo Verde has made significant efforts to improve the healthcare system in recent years, including investments in infrastructure, equipment, and personnel. As a result, the country has seen significant improvements in health indicators, such as life expectancy and infant mortality rates. Despite these advances, there are still challenges to be addressed, including a shortage of medical specialists and limited access to certain types of care, such as specialized surgical services.

The healthcare system in Cabo Verde is also influenced by the country's cultural and socioeconomic context. Many people in Cabo Verde rely on traditional medicine and may seek care from traditional practitioners, especially in rural areas. The government has recognized the importance of traditional medicine and has implemented programs to integrate it into the formal healthcare system.
