[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde's tax system is based on the principle of **territorial taxation**, where individuals and businesses are taxed only on income earned within the country. However, residents are subject to **worldwide taxation**, meaning they are taxed on their global income, regardless of where it is earned.

To be considered a **tax resident** in Cabo Verde, an individual must have a permanent home in the country, or spend more than 183 days in the country in a calendar year.

The tax system in Cabo Verde is administered by the **National Directorate of Taxes**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax advice to taxpayers. The country has a relatively simple tax system, with a limited number of tax rates and exemptions.

It is therefore essential to consult a qualified tax professional to ensure compliance with all tax laws and regulations.
