# The Truth About Cabo Verde - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde, located off the coast of West Africa, has a unique history that spans over five centuries. The **uninhabited islands** were discovered by the Portuguese in 1462, and by the early 16th century, the Portuguese had established the first permanent settlements. The islands' strategic location made them an important stopover for ships traveling between Europe, Africa, and the Americas. As a result, Cabo Verde became a major hub for the **transatlantic slave trade**, with thousands of enslaved Africans passing through the islands on their way to the Americas.

In the 19th century, Cabo Verde's economy began to shift towards **agriculture** and **fishing**, with the islands becoming a major producer of crops such as sugarcane, coffee, and cotton. However, the islands' economy was heavily dependent on Portugal, and the lack of investment and infrastructure hindered Cabo Verde's development. The **Cabo Verdean independence movement** began to gain momentum in the mid-20th century, with the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) leading the fight for independence.

Cabo Verde gained its independence from Portugal on July 5, 1975, after over 500 years of Portuguese rule. The country's first president, **Aristides Pereira**, played a key role in the independence movement and served as president from 1975 to 1991. Since independence, Cabo Verde has made significant progress in developing its economy, improving its infrastructure, and strengthening its democratic institutions.

In recent years, Cabo Verde has continued to strengthen its economy, with a focus on **tourism**, **renewable energy**, and **foreign investment**. The country has also made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards, with the **poverty rate** declining from over 50% in the 1990s to around 20% today. Despite these challenges, Cabo Verde remains one of the most stable and democratic countries in West Africa, with a strong tradition of **peaceful transfers of power** and a vibrant **civil society**.
