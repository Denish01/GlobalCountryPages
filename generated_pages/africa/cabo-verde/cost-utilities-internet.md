[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water. The quality of utility services is generally good, with minimal interruptions to supply. The government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and investments in renewable energy.

The cost of utilities in Cabo Verde is relatively stable, with minimal price increases in recent years. However, the cost of electricity has increased slightly due to the rising cost of fuel and maintenance of the power grid. The government has implemented a tariff system to regulate the cost of utilities, which has helped to keep prices stable. Despite this, the cost of utilities can still vary depending on the provider and the location, with urban areas tend to have higher costs than rural areas.
