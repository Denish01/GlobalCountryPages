[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving the overall quality of life for its citizens. The government has invested heavily in upgrading the country's roads, expanding access to electricity and water, and improving telecommunications services. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity and clean water. Despite these challenges, Cabo Verde has made notable progress in recent years, with the country's infrastructure development level being considered one of the most advanced in West Africa.

The government of Cabo Verde has implemented several initiatives aimed at improving the country's infrastructure, including the development of a new national infrastructure plan. This plan aims to improve the country's roads, increase access to electricity and water, and expand telecommunications services. The plan also includes initiatives to improve the country's ports and airports, with the goal of increasing trade and economic growth. Overall, Cabo Verde's infrastructure is well-developed compared to other countries in the region, but there is still a need for continued investment and development to address the urban-rural gap and improve the overall quality of life for citizens.

Cabo Verde's infrastructure development has also been supported by international organizations and donors, who have provided significant funding and technical assistance to support the country's infrastructure development goals. For example, the World Bank has provided funding to support the development of Cabo Verde's roads and transportation infrastructure, while the European Union has provided funding to support the development of the country's energy and water sectors.
