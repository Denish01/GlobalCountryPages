The cost of living in Cabo Verde is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which affects the price of goods, including food. However, the country's **subsidized food program** helps to keep prices stable for staple foods such as rice, beans, and bread. Eating out is a popular culture in Cabo Verde, with many restaurants serving traditional dishes such as **catchupa** (a stew made with fish or meat, beans, and vegetables) and **arroz de peixe** (fish rice). However, home cooking is also common, and many people prefer to buy ingredients at local markets to prepare their own meals.\n\nThe food prices in Cabo Verde can fluctuate depending on the season, with prices tend to be higher during the peak tourist season. The government's efforts to promote **local agriculture** and reduce reliance on imports have helped to stabilize food prices and improve food security. Additionally, the country's **fishing industry** provides a steady supply of fresh seafood, which is a staple in many Cabo Verdean dishes. Overall, while food prices in Cabo Verde may be higher than in some other African countries, the quality and variety of food available make it a great destination for foodies and travelers alike.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 150 CVE | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 120 CVE | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.50 | 250 CVE | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.80 | 180 CVE | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 600 CVE | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $8.00 | 800 CVE | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.50 | 350 CVE | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00 | 200 CVE | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 150 CVE | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.20 | 120 CVE | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00 | 500 CVE | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 100 CVE | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$35 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | (upscale) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Cabo Verde. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, but they offer a wider range of products, including imported goods. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and staple foods at lower prices, but the selection may be limited. It's recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported products. Bargaining is not common in supermarkets, but it's expected at local markets, where vendors may be willing to negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases.\n\nIn general, local markets offer a more authentic shopping experience, with vendors selling everything from fresh fish to handicrafts. The **Mercado de Praia** in the capital city is a great place to experience the sights and sounds of a local market, with a wide range of goods on offer. Supermarkets, on the other hand, are more convenient for tourists and expats, with many stores offering a range of international products. Some popular supermarket chains in Cabo Verde include **Supermercado** and **Mini Mercado**.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Cabo Verde is to buy ingredients at local markets and prepare your own meals.\n- **Rice and beans** are staple foods in Cabo Verde and are often served with grilled meats or fish.\n- **Fresh seafood** is a specialty in Cabo Verde, with many restaurants serving a range of fish and seafood dishes.\n- **Local fruits**, such as mangoes and bananas, are abundant and delicious, and can be bought at local markets or from street vendors.\n- **Avoid buying imported goods**, such as meat and dairy products, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- **Try traditional dishes**, such as **catchupa** and **arroz de peixe**, which are often served at local restaurants and are a great way to experience the local culture.",
