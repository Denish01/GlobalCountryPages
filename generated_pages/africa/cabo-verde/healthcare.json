The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the country. However, the private sector is also well-established, with many private clinics and hospitals, especially in the capital city of Praia. The quality of care in Cabo Verde is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where facilities and resources may be limited.\n\nThe government of Cabo Verde has made significant efforts to improve the healthcare system in recent years, including investments in infrastructure, equipment, and personnel. As a result, the country has seen significant improvements in health indicators, such as life expectancy and infant mortality rates.
