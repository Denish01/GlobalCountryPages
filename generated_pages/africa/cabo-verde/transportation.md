[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde has two main international airports, Amílcar Cabral International Airport (SID) on the island of Sal and Nelson Mandela International Airport (RAI) on the island of Santiago, which serve as hubs for flights to and from Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Direct flights are available from major European cities such as Lisbon, Amsterdam, and Paris, as well as from West African cities like Dakar and Lagos. Overland entry points are limited, as Cabo Verde is an island nation, but it is possible to arrive by sea, either by ferry or private boat, at ports such as Praia, Mindelo, or Sal Rei.

The most convenient way to get to Cabo Verde is by air, as the country is located off the coast of West Africa and has limited connections to the mainland. However, for those who prefer to travel by sea, there are several shipping lines and ferry services that connect Cabo Verde to other West African countries, as well as to Europe. It is worth noting that traveling by sea can be time-consuming and may not be as comfortable as flying, but it can be a more affordable option for those on a budget.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between the islands. The main domestic airlines are TACV Cabo Verde Airlines and Binter CV, which offer flights between the islands of Sal, Santiago, Boa Vista, and São Vicente. The most popular routes are between Praia and Sal, and between Praia and São Vicente. Booking tips include booking in advance to secure the best prices, and being flexible with your travel dates, as prices can vary depending on the day of the week and time of year. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde does not have a rail network, so there are no trains or rail options available for getting around the country. This is due to the country's geography, with many islands and limited landmass, making it more practical to use buses, taxis, and cars for transportation. As a result, visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around the islands.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde has a relatively well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity buses between the islands. The main bus companies are **Transportes Élias Fortes** and **Transportes Morabeza**, which offer routes between the major towns and cities on each island. The buses are generally comfortable and reliable, with air conditioning and reasonable prices. Costs range from $5 to $20, depending on the route and distance. It is worth noting that bus schedules can be limited, especially on weekends and holidays, so it is a good idea to plan ahead and book your tickets in advance.
