[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private sector, but it is more affordable for locals. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred choice due to its higher standard of care and wider range of services available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded, which can lead to long waiting times and a shortage of medical supplies. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics are well-equipped and offer a higher level of care, but at a significantly higher cost. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare.

The healthcare system in Cabo Verde is organized into three levels of care: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary care is provided by health centers and clinics, which offer basic medical services such as consultations, vaccinations, and minor surgeries. Secondary care is provided by hospitals, which offer more specialized services such as emergency care, surgery, and hospitalization. Tertiary care is provided by specialized hospitals and clinics, which offer advanced medical services such as cancer treatment, cardiac surgery, and neurosurgery. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek private healthcare services, which can be more expensive but offer a higher level of care.
