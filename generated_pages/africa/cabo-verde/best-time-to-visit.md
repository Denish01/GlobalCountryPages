[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Cabo Verde has a tropical dry climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from November to June, is characterized by low humidity, mild temperatures, and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit the islands. The wet season, which runs from July to October, is hot and humid, with most of the country's annual rainfall occurring during these months. The climate varies across the different islands, with the northern islands being generally cooler and drier than the southern islands. The trade winds also play a significant role in shaping the climate, bringing cool air from the north and helping to moderate the temperatures.

The dry season is the best time to visit Cabo Verde, as the weather is pleasant and there are plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy, such as hiking, snorkeling, and whale watching. The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as the heat and humidity can be oppressive, and some tourist facilities may be closed. However, the wet season is also a time of great natural beauty, with the landscapes being lush and green, and the waterfalls being at their most spectacular.

The seasons also affect the travel crowd, with the peak season being from December to April, when the weather is at its best, and the crowds are at their largest. The budget season, which runs from May to June, is a good time to visit if you're looking for lower prices and smaller crowds. However, if you're looking for a more relaxed atmosphere, you may want to consider visiting during the shoulder season, which runs from November to December or from April to May.
