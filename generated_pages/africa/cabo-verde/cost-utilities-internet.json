However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water. The quality of utility services is generally good, with minimal interruptions to supply. The government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and investments in renewable energy.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Cabo Verde is relatively stable, with minimal price increases in recent years. However, the cost of electricity has increased slightly due to the rising cost of fuel and maintenance of the power grid. The government has implemented a tariff system to regulate the cost of utilities, which has helped to keep prices stable. Despite this, the cost of utilities can still vary depending on the provider and the location, with urban areas tend to have higher costs than rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50-$70 | $80-$120 | $120-$150 | |\n| Water | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | $30-$40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | $30-$40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5-$10 | $10-$15 | $15-$20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$75-$120** | **$130-$195** | **$195-$250** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-$30 | 10-20 Mbps | Cabo Verde Telecom, Unitel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-$60 | 50-100 Mbps | Cabo Verde Telecom, Unitel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-$20 | 5-10 GB | Cabo Verde Telecom, Unitel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$30 | 10-20 GB | Cabo Verde Telecom, Unitel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-$100 | varies | Cabo Verde Telecom, Unitel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Cabo Verde, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as Cabo Verde Telecom or Unitel, to arrange for installation and billing.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help to reduce costs and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Cabo Verde are Cabo Verde Telecom and Unitel, which offer reliable and fast connections.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances and turn off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
