[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Burundi is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by health centers and dispensaries, while secondary care is provided by district hospitals, and tertiary care is provided by national referral hospitals. However, the public healthcare system is underfunded and understaffed, leading to a significant shortage of medical professionals and equipment. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer better quality care, but are often unaffordable for the majority of the population. Urban areas, such as the capital city Gitega, have better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where healthcare facilities are often basic and lacking in essential supplies.

The quality of care in Burundi is a major concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment, medications, and trained personnel. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Burundi has one of the lowest densities of healthcare workers in Africa, with only 0.2 physicians per 1,000 people. This has resulted in a high mortality rate, particularly among children and mothers. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the construction of new healthcare facilities.

The **National Health Insurance Scheme** is a key component of the healthcare system in Burundi, aiming to increase access to healthcare services for the population. However, the scheme is still in its early stages, and coverage is limited, particularly in rural areas. Foreigners and expatriates are often required to have private health insurance, as the public healthcare system may not provide adequate care for their needs.
