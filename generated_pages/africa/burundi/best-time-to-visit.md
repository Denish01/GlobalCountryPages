# Best Time to Visit Burundi — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Burundi is during the dry season, from June to August, when the weather is mild and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploring the country's natural beauty. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Burundi: June to August. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: April to May and September to November. Avoid: March to April and October to November due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Burundi has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from June to August, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from September to May, is divided into two parts: the short rains from September to November and the long rains from December to May. The wet season can be challenging for travel, as heavy rainfall can cause flooding and make roads impassable. The country's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the highlands being cooler than the low-lying areas.

The dry season is the best time to visit Burundi's national parks and wildlife reserves, as the dry vegetation makes it easier to spot animals. The wet season, on the other hand, is the best time to see the country's beautiful waterfalls and lakes, as they are filled with water. However, the wet season can also be a challenging time to travel, as some roads may be closed due to flooding. Overall, the dry season is the best time to visit Burundi, but the wet season has its own unique attractions and advantages.

Burundi's climate is also influenced by its location near the equator, which means that the country experiences a relatively constant amount of daylight throughout the year. The temperature also remains relatively constant, with average temperatures ranging from 17°C to 23°C throughout the year. However, the highlands can be cooler, especially at night, so visitors should pack accordingly.
