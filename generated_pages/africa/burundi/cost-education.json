Public education is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private education, with limited resources and outdated teaching methods. The language of instruction is primarily **Kirundi**, with **French** also being widely used, especially in secondary and tertiary education. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are available in the capital city, Gitega, and other major urban centers, offering a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Exams**.\n\nThe quality of education in Burundi is a significant concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure, such as classrooms, desks, and toilets. Additionally, the country faces a severe shortage of qualified teachers, with many schools relying on untrained or undertrained staff. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent private schools and international schools that offer high-quality education, often with a focus on **bilingualism** and **cultural diversity**. These schools are highly sought after by expatriate families and wealthy Burundians, but are often unaffordable for the majority of the population.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Primary | $100-$500 | Range of quality, from basic to excellent |\n| Public Secondary | $20-$50 (subsidized) | Limited resources, outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Secondary | $200-$1,000 | Range of quality, from basic to excellent |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | High-quality education, range of curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Limited resources, outdated teaching methods |\n| Private University | $200-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Range of quality, from basic to excellent |\n| Top-Ranked University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | **University of Burundi**, high-quality education |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$50 | Limited availability, especially in rural areas |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $5-$10 | Range of quality, from basic to excellent |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $20-$50 | **French**, **English**, and **Kirundi** courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $10-$20 | Basic supplies, such as pens, pencils, and notebooks |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Required for all students, especially in private schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **University of Burundi** is the top-ranked university in the country, offering a range of programs, including **medicine**, **engineering**, and **agriculture**.\n- **Scholarships** are available for students who excel academically, especially in **science**, **technology**, **engineering**, and **mathematics** (STEM) fields.\n- **Online learning** options are limited, but some universities and private institutions offer **distance learning** programs, especially in **business** and **economics**.\n- **Expatriate families** often prefer international schools, which offer a range of curricula and **bilingual** programs.\n- **Education quality** in Burundi is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, such as **Rwanda** and **Tanzania**.\n- **Language skills** are essential for students who want to pursue higher education or careers in **international organizations** or **multinational companies**.",
