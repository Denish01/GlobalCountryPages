The country's economy has been growing slowly, with a GDP growth rate of around 4% per year. However, the economy is vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events. Burundi's development level is low, with a Human Development Index (HDI) ranking of 185 out of 189 countries. The country faces significant challenges, including a large trade deficit, a high dependence on foreign aid, and a lack of economic diversification.\n\nThe economy of Burundi is primarily driven by the agricultural sector, which accounts for around 40% of GDP and employs the majority of the workforce. The country's main crops include coffee, cotton, and tea, which are exported to other countries. However, the agricultural sector is vulnerable to weather-related events, such as droughts and floods, which can have a significant impact on crop yields and exports. The manufacturing sector is also small, with a focus on food processing, textiles, and construction materials.\n\nDespite the challenges it faces, the government of Burundi is working to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. The country has implemented a number of reforms, including the creation of a one-stop shop for investors and the introduction of a new investment code. However, more needs to be done to address the underlying structural issues that are holding back the economy, including a lack of infrastructure and a shortage of skilled workers.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 40% of GDP | Coffee, cotton, tea, and food crops are the main products |\n| Mining | 5% of GDP | Nickel, gold, and rare earth minerals are the main minerals extracted |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | Food processing, textiles, and construction materials are the main products |\n| Services | 45% of GDP | Financial services, tourism, and transportation are the main sectors |\n| Tourism | 1% of GDP | Lake Tanganyika and the national parks are the main attractions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Coffee**: Burundi's main export crop, accounting for around 50% of total exports\n- **Tea**: Another important export crop, with around 20% of total exports\n- **Cotton**: A significant export crop, with around 10% of total exports\n- **Nickel**: A key mineral export, with around 5% of total exports\n- **Gold**: A small but growing export sector, with around 2% of total exports\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food products**: Around 20% of total imports\n- **Petroleum products**: Around 15% of total imports\n- **Machinery and equipment**: Around 10% of total imports\n- **Transportation vehicles**: Around 5% of total imports\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: Around 5% of total imports\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- **Belgium**: A key export market for Burundian coffee and tea\n- **Tanzania**: A significant trading partner, with imports of food products and petroleum\n- **Kenya**: A growing trading partner, with imports of machinery and equipment\n- **China**: A significant investor in Burundi's mining sector\n- **United States**: A key donor country, providing significant foreign aid to Burundi\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country has a limited transport network, with around 12,000 km of roads, of which only 10% are paved\n- The energy sector is underdeveloped, with around 10% of the population having access to electricity\n- Internet and mobile penetration is low, with around 5% of the population having access to the internet\n- The country has one international airport, located in the capital city of Gitega\n- The port of Bujumbura is the country's main port, handling around 90% of total trade\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe economic outlook for Burundi is uncertain, with a number of challenges facing the country. The government is working to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, but more needs to be done to address the underlying structural issues that are holding back the economy. The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events. However, there are also opportunities for growth, particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors. The government is working to diversify the economy and improve the country's infrastructure, including the transport network and energy sector.\n\nIn the short term, the government is focused on implementing a number of key projects, including the development of a new national development plan and the implementation of a number of reforms to improve the business environment. The country is also working to attract foreign investment, particularly in the mining and agricultural sectors. In the long term, the government is working to achieve a number of key development goals, including reducing poverty and improving living standards. However, this will require significant investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, as well as a concerted effort to address the underlying structural issues that are holding back the economy.",
