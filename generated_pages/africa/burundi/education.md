[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Burundi is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 13, is provided free of charge by the government and is the foundation of the education system. The primary education curriculum includes subjects such as **mathematics**, **science**, **French**, and **Kirundi**. Secondary education, which lasts for 6 years, is divided into two cycles: lower secondary and upper secondary. Lower secondary education is compulsory, while upper secondary education is optional and prepares students for higher education or vocational training. Tertiary education is provided by several universities and institutions, including the **University of Burundi**, which is the largest and most prestigious university in the country.

The quality of education in Burundi varies greatly between public and private schools. Public schools, which are free and open to all, often suffer from a lack of resources, including textbooks, furniture, and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education but are often expensive and inaccessible to many Burundians. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including the introduction of free primary education and the construction of new schools and classrooms.

The education system in Burundi is also affected by the country's socio-economic context. Many children, particularly in rural areas, do not have access to education due to poverty, lack of infrastructure, and cultural barriers. Additionally, the country's history of conflict and instability has had a negative impact on the education system, with many schools being destroyed or forced to close. However, the government and international organizations are working to rebuild and strengthen the education system, with a focus on improving access, quality, and equity.
