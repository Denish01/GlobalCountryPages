[SECTION] How Expensive Is Burundi? [/SECTION]
Burundi is considered one of the most affordable countries in Africa, with a low cost of living compared to its neighbors. The country's economy is largely driven by agriculture, and the lack of industrialization has kept prices relatively low. Compared to other African countries, Burundi is more affordable than Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, but slightly more expensive than Tanzania. The cost of living in Burundi is also influenced by the country's limited infrastructure and lack of tourist facilities, which can make it challenging for visitors to find high-end accommodations and dining options.

Overall, Burundi is an excellent destination for budget-conscious travelers who want to experience the beauty and culture of Africa without breaking the bank. The country's stunning natural landscapes, vibrant markets, and friendly people make it an attractive destination for backpackers and adventure seekers. However, visitors should be aware that the country's infrastructure and amenities are limited, and prices can vary depending on the location and availability of goods and services.
