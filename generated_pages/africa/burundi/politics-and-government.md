[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Burundi is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President has significant powers, including the ability to appoint and dismiss ministers, as well as to dissolve the National Assembly. The **legislative branch** is composed of a bicameral parliament, consisting of the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly has 123 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The Senate has 43 seats, with members elected by indirect vote for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, and the Court of Appeals.

The government of Burundi is a **unitary state**, with a centralized administration and a strong emphasis on national unity. The country is divided into 18 provinces, each with its own governor and administration. The provinces are further divided into communes, which are the basic units of local government. The government has a complex system of **separation of powers**, with checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. However, the President has significant powers, which can sometimes limit the ability of the other branches to check the executive.

The political system in Burundi is based on a **multi-party system**, with several parties competing for power. However, the **National Council for the Defense of Democracy - Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD)** has been the dominant party since 2005. The party has a strong base of support among the rural population and has been able to maintain its power through a combination of patronage, repression, and manipulation of the electoral system.
