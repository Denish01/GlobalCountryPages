  "content": "The cost of transportation in Burundi can vary greatly depending on the mode of transport, with a monthly transit pass costing around $10 USD and a taxi start rate of $2 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($10 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($2 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.20 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (No)\nCurrency: BIF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nBurundi has a limited but growing transportation network, with most people relying on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of maintenance being common issues. However, the country is investing in improving its transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the renovation of existing ones. In urban areas, such as the capital city Gitega, **city buses** and **taxis** are also available, providing a relatively affordable and convenient way to get around.\n\nThe majority of Burundians rely on **walking** or **cycling** as their primary mode of transportation, especially in rural areas where public transportation is scarce. For longer distances, **intercity buses** and **domestic flights** are available, although they can be more expensive. The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system makes it challenging for people to move around, especially for those who cannot afford private transportation. However, the government is working to improve the situation, and there are plans to introduce new transportation modes, such as **commuter trains**, in the near future.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20 | $10 | Limited coverage, overcrowding |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50 | N/A | Extensive network, variable prices |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2 | $0.50 | $5-10 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-30 | Private car or taxi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-5 | Limited toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Variable prices, limited comfort |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-200 | Limited routes, high prices |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are often cheaper than **taxis** or **car rentals**.\n- When using **taxis**, it's a good idea to **negotiate the fare** before starting your journey, as meters are not always available.\n- **Walking** or **cycling** can be a good option for short distances, especially in urban areas where traffic can be heavy.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or when using public transportation.\n- Consider using **private car services** or **airport transfers** for longer distances or when traveling with a group, as they can be more convenient and safer than public transportation.\n- When renting a car, make sure to **check the vehicle's condition** and **insurance coverage** before signing any agreements.",
