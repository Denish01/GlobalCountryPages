[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Burundi operates a **territorial taxation system**, where individuals and companies are taxed on their income derived from Burundian sources, regardless of their tax residency status. The tax year in Burundi runs from January to December. To be considered a tax resident in Burundi, an individual must have a permanent home in the country, or have been present in the country for at least six months in a calendar year. Non-residents are taxed only on their Burundian-sourced income.

The tax system in Burundi is administered by the **Directorate General of Taxes**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax services to taxpayers. The tax authority has implemented various measures to improve tax compliance, including the introduction of electronic filing and payment systems. Taxpayers can also access tax information and services through the tax authority's website and social media platforms.
