Burundi is a small, landlocked country located in the eastern part of the African continent. It is situated in the African Great Lakes region, bordered by three countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west, Rwanda to the north, and Tanzania to the east and south. Although Burundi is landlocked, it has a significant coastline along Lake Tanganyika, the second-deepest lake in the world. The country's strategic location in the heart of Africa makes it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region.

The borders of Burundi are relatively small, with a total length of approximately 1,140 kilometers. The country's border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the longest, stretching for about 315 kilometers, while the border with Rwanda is the shortest, at around 315 kilometers. The border with Tanzania is the most significant, as it provides access to the lake and the surrounding region. The unique location of Burundi, surrounded by mountains and lakes, has played a significant role in shaping the country's history, culture, and economy.

The country is dominated by the **Albertine Rift**, a mountain range that stretches from the Red Sea to the Mozambique Channel.

The **Imbonerakure** Mountains, located in the north of the country, are known for their unique rock formations and scenic landscapes.

The **Lake Tanganyika** coastline is one of the most significant features of Burundi's landscape. The lake is the second-deepest in the world and is home to a diverse range of aquatic life. The lake's shoreline is characterized by steep cliffs, rocky outcrops, and sandy beaches. The surrounding area is also home to a number of **national parks** and **game reserves**, which provide a habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including **lions**, **leopards**, and **elephants**. The **Kibira National Park**, located in the northwest of the country, is one of the most popular national parks in Burundi, known for its lush forests and diverse wildlife.

The **rivers** of Burundi play a crucial role in the country's ecosystem. The **Ruvubu River**, which flows through the capital city of Gitega, is one of the most significant rivers in the country. The river is known for its crystal-clear waters and is a popular spot for **fishing** and **boating**. The **Mutzindzi River**, located in the south of the country, is another significant river that flows into Lake Tanganyika.
