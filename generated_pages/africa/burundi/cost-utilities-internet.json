The cost of utilities in Burundi can fluctuate due to factors such as inflation, which was 20.2% in 2024, and seasonal variation in demand. For example, during the dry season, the cost of electricity may increase due to higher demand for power. Additionally, the cost of water and garbage collection may vary depending on the municipality and the provider.\n\nThe Burundian government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the electricity grid and the development of new water treatment plants. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, particularly those in rural areas where access to basic services is limited. To mitigate this, some households opt for alternative energy sources, such as solar power, and collect rainwater for non-potable uses.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $20 | $40 | $60 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in municipal tax |\n| **Total** | **$40** | **$80** | **$120** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Burundi Telecom, Onatel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Burundi Telecom, Onatel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1 GB | Econet, Smart Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Econet, Smart Telecom |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Burundi Telecom, Onatel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in some areas |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in some areas |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the provider directly and provide proof of residence and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget their energy usage.\n- The best internet providers in Burundi are Burundi Telecom and Onatel, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, households can consider using energy-efficient appliances, collecting rainwater, and using alternative energy sources.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with the provider to get the best rates, especially for phone and internet bundles.",
