[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Burundi is overseen by the Ministry of Education, and it is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Public education is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private education, with limited resources and outdated teaching methods. The language of instruction is primarily **Kirundi**, with **French** also being widely used, especially in secondary and tertiary education. Compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from age 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. International schools are available in the capital city, Gitega, and other major urban centers, offering a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Exams**.

The quality of education in Burundi is a significant concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure, such as classrooms, desks, and toilets. Additionally, the country faces a severe shortage of qualified teachers, with many schools relying on untrained or undertrained staff. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent private schools and international schools that offer high-quality education, often with a focus on **bilingualism** and **cultural diversity**. These schools are highly sought after by expatriate families and wealthy Burundians, but are often unaffordable for the majority of the population.
