[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in Burundi is Melchior Ndadaye International Airport, located in the capital city of Gitega, but it is actually situated in the town of Bugarama, about 10 kilometers northwest of Bujumbura, the former capital and largest city. There are direct flights to and from a few major hubs in Africa, including Nairobi, Kigali, and Addis Ababa, but most travelers will need to connect through one of these cities to reach Burundi. Overland entry points are available from neighboring countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Tanzania, although the border crossings can be slow and bureaucratic.

Travelers can enter Burundi by land through several border crossings, including the ones at Gatuna, Kabanga, and Kobero. However, the road conditions from the borders to the main cities can be poor, and public transportation options may be limited. It is recommended to hire a private vehicle or taxi for the journey. Additionally, travelers should be prepared for long wait times and potential delays at the border crossings, and should ensure that they have all necessary documents, including a valid passport and visa, if required.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The domestic air network in Burundi is limited, with only a few flights per week connecting the capital city of Gitega to the towns of Gitega and Bujumbura. The main domestic airline is Air Burundi, which operates a small fleet of aircraft and offers limited routes and schedules. Booking in advance is recommended, as flights can fill up quickly, especially during peak travel seasons. The approximate cost of a domestic flight in Burundi is around $100-$200 USD, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Burundi does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. The country's terrain and geography have made it difficult to develop a rail system, and as a result, most transportation is done by road or air. This can make traveling around the country more challenging, especially for those who are used to the convenience of train travel. However, there are plans to develop a rail link between Burundi and the port city of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, which could potentially improve transportation options in the future.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus companies in Burundi offer a relatively affordable and convenient way to travel around the country. The main bus companies, such as Amahoro and Belvedere, operate on a variety of routes, including between the capital city of Gitega and the towns of Bujumbura, Rumonge, and Nyanza-Lac. The quality of the buses can vary, but most are relatively comfortable and well-maintained. The cost of a bus ticket in Burundi is around $5-$10 USD, depending on the route and distance. However, the road conditions can be poor, and the journey times can be long, so travelers should be prepared for delays and potential discomfort.
