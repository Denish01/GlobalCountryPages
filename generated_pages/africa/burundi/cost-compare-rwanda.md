[SECTION] Overview: Burundi vs Rwanda [/SECTION]
Burundi and Rwanda are two neighboring countries in East Africa, both with unique economic contexts that affect the cost of living. Burundi has a smaller economy and lower GDP per capita, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Rwanda has a more developed economy and a higher GDP per capita, resulting in higher costs for housing, food, and transportation. Overall, Burundi is a more affordable option for those looking to live in the region, with costs that are generally 20-30% lower than in Rwanda.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Burundi's economy is largely dependent on agriculture, while Rwanda has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on tourism and technology. This diversification has led to higher costs in Rwanda, particularly in the capital city of Kigali. In contrast, Burundi's capital city, Gitega, has a more laid-back atmosphere and lower costs. Despite the differences, both countries offer a unique cultural experience and a chance to explore the natural beauty of East Africa.
