# Burundi Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Burundi's infrastructure is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in roads, power, and water supply, particularly in rural areas, posing challenges to the country's economic growth and development.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 10.4% of population
Internet Penetration: 6.6%
Road Network: 12,322 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 1
Major Ports: landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Burundi's infrastructure is one of the least developed in Africa, with significant challenges in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country has made some progress in recent years, with investments in the energy and transport sectors, but much remains to be done to address the infrastructure gap. The urban-rural divide is significant, with cities like Gitega and Bujumbura having better access to infrastructure services than rural areas. The government has identified infrastructure development as a key priority, with a focus on improving the business environment and promoting economic growth.

Despite these challenges, Burundi has made some progress in recent years, with the implementation of several infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones. The country has also made efforts to improve access to electricity, with the construction of new power plants and the expansion of the grid. However, much remains to be done to address the significant infrastructure gap, particularly in rural areas. The government has also launched initiatives to improve access to water and sanitation, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the rehabilitation of existing ones.

The lack of infrastructure in Burundi is a major constraint to economic development, with businesses and households facing significant challenges in terms of access to basic services. The country's infrastructure deficit is estimated to be significant, with a need for investment in roads, energy, water, and sanitation. The government has identified infrastructure development as a key priority, with a focus on improving the business environment and promoting economic growth. However, the country faces significant challenges in terms of financing, with a need for external funding to support infrastructure development.

[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]
[TABLE]
| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roads | 12,322 km | Poor | mostly unpaved and in need of maintenance |
| Railways | none | - | no rail network in Burundi |
| Airports | 1 international, 6 domestic | Moderate | limited air transport options |
| Ports | landlocked | - | relies on neighboring countries for port access |
[/TABLE]
Burundi's transport infrastructure is limited, with a focus on road transport. The country has a network of roads, but most are unpaved and in poor condition, making it difficult to travel, especially during the rainy season. The lack of a rail network and limited air transport options also constrains the movement of goods and people. The country's landlocked status means that it relies on neighboring countries for port access, which can increase the cost of trade.
