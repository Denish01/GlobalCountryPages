[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Burundi is a relatively affordable country to live in, with a low cost of living compared to other countries in Africa. The GDP per capita (PPP) of $1,195 indicates a relatively low standard of living, but this also means that expenses such as rent, food, and transportation are relatively cheap. A budget lifestyle in Burundi can be achieved with around $250 per month, which would cover basic expenses such as rent, food, and transportation. However, this would require a very simple lifestyle, with limited access to amenities such as internet, entertainment, and healthcare. In comparison to neighboring countries, Burundi is more affordable than Rwanda, but slightly more expensive than Tanzania.

The cost of living in Burundi varies depending on the location, with the capital city Gitega being more expensive than other cities. The cost of living in Burundi is also influenced by the inflation rate, which is currently at 20.2%, and the out-of-pocket health spend, which is 24.5% of total health expenditure. This means that individuals may need to budget extra for unexpected medical expenses. Overall, Burundi can be a good option for individuals looking for a low-cost lifestyle, but it may not be the best choice for those who require a high standard of living or access to advanced amenities.

[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]
A budget lifestyle in Burundi would require a very simple and frugal approach to living. Individuals on this budget would need to share an apartment outside of the city center, cook most of their meals, and rely on public transportation. They would also need to limit their entertainment and social activities, and avoid eating out at restaurants. However, this budget would still allow for some basic amenities such as internet and phone access, and some limited entertainment options. For example, a budget lifestyle in Burundi might include living in a shared apartment in a neighborhood such as Ngagara, cooking most meals at home, and using public transportation to get around. Entertainment options might include visiting local markets, attending church services, or watching soccer matches at a local stadium.

A mid-range lifestyle in Burundi would offer more comfort and flexibility than a budget lifestyle. Individuals on this budget could afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment in the city center, eat out at restaurants occasionally, and use a mix of public and private transportation. They could also afford to purchase some entertainment options such as a gym membership or a television. However, this budget would still require some careful planning and budgeting, and individuals would need to be mindful of their expenses to avoid overspending. For example, a mid-range lifestyle in Burundi might include living in a one-bedroom apartment in a neighborhood such as Kiyange, eating out at restaurants a few times a week, and using a taxi or car to get around. Entertainment options might include attending concerts or festivals, playing sports, or taking a weekend trip to a nearby town.

A comfortable lifestyle in Burundi would offer a high standard of living, with access to advanced amenities such as private healthcare, a car, and regular entertainment options. Individuals on this budget could afford to rent a nice two-bedroom apartment in a desirable neighborhood, eat out at restaurants regularly, and use a taxi or car to get around. They could also afford to purchase luxury items such as a laptop or a smartphone, and take regular trips to other countries. However, this budget would require a significant amount of money, and individuals would need to have a high income or significant savings to afford this lifestyle. For example, a comfortable lifestyle in Burundi might include living in a two-bedroom apartment in a neighborhood such as Kigobe, eating out at restaurants several times a week, and using a car to get around. Entertainment options might include attending international concerts or festivals, playing golf, or taking a weekend trip to a nearby country.
