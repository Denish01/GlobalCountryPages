[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Burundi has a limited but growing transportation network, with most people relying on **minibuses** and **shared taxis** to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of maintenance being common issues. However, the country is investing in improving its transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the renovation of existing ones. In urban areas, such as the capital city Gitega, **city buses** and **taxis** are also available, providing a relatively affordable and convenient way to get around.

The majority of Burundians rely on **walking** or **cycling** as their primary mode of transportation, especially in rural areas where public transportation is scarce. For longer distances, **intercity buses** and **domestic flights** are available, although they can be more expensive. The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system makes it challenging for people to move around, especially for those who cannot afford private transportation. However, the government is working to improve the situation, and there are plans to introduce new transportation modes, such as **commuter trains**, in the near future.

[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]
- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are often cheaper than **taxis** or **car rentals**.
- When using **taxis**, it's a good idea to **negotiate the fare** before starting your journey, as meters are not always available.
- **Walking** or **cycling** can be a good option for short distances, especially in urban areas where traffic can be heavy.

- Consider using **private car services** or **airport transfers** for longer distances or when traveling with a group, as they can be more convenient and safer than public transportation.
