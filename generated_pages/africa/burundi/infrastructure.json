  "content": "Burundi's infrastructure is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in roads, power, and water supply, particularly in rural areas, posing challenges to the country's economic growth and development.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 10.4% of population\nInternet Penetration: 6.6%\nRoad Network: 12,322 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nBurundi's infrastructure is one of the least developed in Africa, with significant challenges in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country has made some progress in recent years, with investments in the energy and transport sectors, but much remains to be done to address the infrastructure gap. The urban-rural divide is significant, with cities like Gitega and Bujumbura having better access to infrastructure services than rural areas. The government has identified infrastructure development as a key priority, with a focus on improving the business environment and promoting economic growth.\n\nDespite these challenges, Burundi has made some progress in recent years, with the implementation of several infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones. The country has also made efforts to improve access to electricity, with the construction of new power plants and the expansion of the grid. However, much remains to be done to address the significant infrastructure gap, particularly in rural areas. The government has also launched initiatives to improve access to water and sanitation, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the rehabilitation of existing ones.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure in Burundi is a major constraint to economic development, with businesses and households facing significant challenges in terms of access to basic services. The country's infrastructure deficit is estimated to be significant, with a need for investment in roads, energy, water, and sanitation. The government has identified infrastructure development as a key priority, with a focus on improving the business environment and promoting economic growth. However, the country faces significant challenges in terms of financing, with a need for external funding to support infrastructure development.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 12,322 km | Poor | mostly unpaved and in need of maintenance |\n| Railways | none | - | no rail network in Burundi |\n| Airports | 1 international, 6 domestic | Moderate | limited air transport options |\n| Ports | landlocked | - | relies on neighboring countries for port access |\n[/TABLE]\nBurundi's transport infrastructure is limited, with a focus on road transport. The country has a network of roads, but most are unpaved and in poor condition, making it difficult to travel, especially during the rainy season. The lack of a rail network and limited air transport options also constrains the movement of goods and people. The country's landlocked status means that it relies on neighboring countries for port access, which can increase the cost of trade.\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Power generation** is mostly based on hydroelectric power, with some thermal power plants\n- **Electricity access** is limited, with only 10.4% of the population having access to electricity\n- **Power outages** are frequent, with many households and businesses relying on generators or other forms of backup power\n- **Renewable energy** is being promoted, with a focus on solar and wind power\n- **Energy efficiency** is also being promoted, with a focus on reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of energy-efficient appliances\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern, with many households relying on untreated water sources\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with many households lacking access to improved sanitation facilities\n- **Water access** is a challenge, particularly in rural areas, where many households rely on traditional water sources\n- **Water treatment** is limited, with many water treatment plants in need of rehabilitation or upgrade\n- **Hygiene promotion** is being promoted, with a focus on improving hygiene practices and reducing the risk of water-borne diseases\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with most of the population having access to mobile phone services\n- **Fiber/broadband** is limited, with few households having access to fixed broadband services\n- **4G/5G rollout** is underway, with several mobile operators launching 4G services\n- **Postal services** are limited, with few households relying on postal services for communication\n- **Internet penetration** is low, with only 6.6% of the population having access to the internet\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- **Road rehabilitation** projects are underway, with a focus on improving the condition of the road network\n- **Energy sector reform** is being implemented, with a focus on improving the efficiency and reliability of the energy sector\n- **Water and sanitation** projects are being implemented, with a focus on improving access to safe water and sanitation\n- **Telecommunications** projects are being implemented, with a focus on improving access to mobile and fixed broadband services\n- **Transport sector development** is being promoted, with a focus on improving the efficiency and safety of the transport sector, including the development of a new airport and the rehabilitation of existing ports.",
