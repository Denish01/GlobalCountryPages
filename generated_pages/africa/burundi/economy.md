[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a low-income economy that is heavily dependent on agriculture. The country's economy has been growing slowly, with a GDP growth rate of around 4% per year. However, the economy is vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events. Burundi's development level is low, with a Human Development Index (HDI) ranking of 185 out of 189 countries. The country faces significant challenges, including a large trade deficit, a high dependence on foreign aid, and a lack of economic diversification.

The economy of Burundi is primarily driven by the agricultural sector, which accounts for around 40% of GDP and employs the majority of the workforce. The country's main crops include coffee, cotton, and tea, which are exported to other countries. However, the agricultural sector is vulnerable to weather-related events, such as droughts and floods, which can have a significant impact on crop yields and exports. The manufacturing sector is also small, with a focus on food processing, textiles, and construction materials.

Despite the challenges it faces, the government of Burundi is working to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. The country has implemented a number of reforms, including the creation of a one-stop shop for investors and the introduction of a new investment code. However, more needs to be done to address the underlying structural issues that are holding back the economy, including a lack of infrastructure and a shortage of skilled workers.

[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]
The economic outlook for Burundi is uncertain, with a number of challenges facing the country. The government is working to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, but more needs to be done to address the underlying structural issues that are holding back the economy. The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events.

The government is working to diversify the economy and improve the country's infrastructure, including the transport network and energy sector.

In the long term, the government is working to achieve a number of key development goals, including reducing poverty and improving living standards. However, this will require significant investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, as well as a concerted effort to address the underlying structural issues that are holding back the economy.
