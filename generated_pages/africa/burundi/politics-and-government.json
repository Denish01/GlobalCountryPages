The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The President has significant powers, including the ability to appoint and dismiss ministers, as well as to dissolve the National Assembly. The **legislative branch** is composed of a bicameral parliament, consisting of the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly has 123 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The Senate has 43 seats, with members elected by indirect vote for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, and the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe government of Burundi is a **unitary state**, with a centralized administration and a strong emphasis on national unity. The country is divided into 18 provinces, each with its own governor and administration. The provinces are further divided into communes, which are the basic units of local government.

However, the **National Council for the Defense of Democracy - Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD)** has been the dominant party since 2005. The party has a strong base of support among the rural population and has been able to maintain its power through a combination of patronage, repression, and manipulation of the electoral system.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Évariste Ndayishimiye | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Prime Minister Gervais Ndirakobuca | Advisory body to the President |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker of the National Assembly | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Legislative | Senate | President of the Senate | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Highest court of appeal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Council for the Defense of Democracy - Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) | Center-left | President Évariste Ndayishimiye | 86 | Dominant party since 2005 |\n| Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) | Center-left | Léonard Nyangoma | 25 | Main opposition party |\n| Union for National Progress (UPRONA) | Center-right | Gaston Sindimwo | 2 | Historic party with limited support |\n| Movement for the Rehabilitation of Citizens - Rurenzangemero (MRC-Rurenzangemero) | Center | Epitace Bayaganakandi | 1 | Small opposition party |\n| National Liberation Front (FNL) | Left | Jacques Bigirimana | 1 | Small opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Burundi is based on a combination of direct and indirect elections, with the President and members of the National Assembly elected by direct vote, and members of the Senate elected by indirect vote.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent presidential election held in 2020 and the most recent legislative election held in 2020.\n- The last election was marked by controversy and violence, with the opposition boycotting the vote and the CNDD-FDD winning a landslide victory.\n- The next election is scheduled to be held in 2025, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Burundi is marked by **tension and repression**, with the government cracking down on opposition parties and civil society organizations.\n- Key issues facing the country include **poverty and inequality**, with Burundi ranking among the poorest countries in the world.\n- The country is also facing **regional dynamics**, with tensions between Burundi and neighboring countries, particularly Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n- The government has been criticized for its **human rights record**, with reports of extrajudicial killings, torture, and forced disappearances.\n- The country has a low ranking on the **Freedom House index**, with a score of 22 out of 100, indicating a lack of freedom and democracy.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Burundi is a member of several **international organizations**, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the East African Community.\n- The country has **close relations** with neighboring countries, particularly Tanzania and Uganda, with which it shares membership in the East African Community.\n- Burundi has also **strengthened ties** with China, which has become a major investor in the country's infrastructure and natural resources.\n- The country has a **complicated relationship** with the European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Burundi due to concerns over human rights and democracy.\n- Burundi is also a member of the **International Organization of La Francophonie**, which promotes cooperation between French-speaking countries.",
