[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Burundi's utility infrastructure is still developing, and the quality of services can vary depending on the location. The cost of utilities in Burundi can fluctuate due to factors such as inflation, which was 20.2% in 2024, and seasonal variation in demand. For example, during the dry season, the cost of electricity may increase due to higher demand for power. Additionally, the cost of water and garbage collection may vary depending on the municipality and the provider.

The Burundian government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the electricity grid and the development of new water treatment plants. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, particularly those in rural areas where access to basic services is limited. To mitigate this, some households opt for alternative energy sources, such as solar power, and collect rainwater for non-potable uses.
