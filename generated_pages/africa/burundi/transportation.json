  "content": "To get around in Burundi, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services, although the transportation infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped and road conditions can be poor.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Melchior Ndadaye International Airport (BJM)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe main international airport in Burundi is Melchior Ndadaye International Airport, located in the capital city of Gitega, but it is actually situated in the town of Bugarama, about 10 kilometers northwest of Bujumbura, the former capital and largest city. There are direct flights to and from a few major hubs in Africa, including Nairobi, Kigali, and Addis Ababa, but most travelers will need to connect through one of these cities to reach Burundi. Overland entry points are available from neighboring countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Tanzania, although the border crossings can be slow and bureaucratic.\n\nTravelers can enter Burundi by land through several border crossings, including the ones at Gatuna, Kabanga, and Kobero. However, the road conditions from the borders to the main cities can be poor, and public transportation options may be limited. It is recommended to hire a private vehicle or taxi for the journey. Additionally, travelers should be prepared for long wait times and potential delays at the border crossings, and should ensure that they have all necessary documents, including a valid passport and visa, if required.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in Burundi is limited, with only a few flights per week connecting the capital city of Gitega to the towns of Gitega and Bujumbura. The main domestic airline is Air Burundi, which operates a small fleet of aircraft and offers limited routes and schedules. Booking in advance is recommended, as flights can fill up quickly, especially during peak travel seasons. The approximate cost of a domestic flight in Burundi is around $100-$200 USD, depending on the route and time of year.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nBurundi does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. The country's terrain and geography have made it difficult to develop a rail system, and as a result, most transportation is done by road or air. This can make traveling around the country more challenging, especially for those who are used to the convenience of train travel. However, there are plans to develop a rail link between Burundi and the port city of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, which could potentially improve transportation options in the future.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus companies in Burundi offer a relatively affordable and convenient way to travel around the country. The main bus companies, such as Amahoro and Belvedere, operate on a variety of routes, including between the capital city of Gitega and the towns of Bujumbura, Rumonge, and Nyanza-Lac. The quality of the buses can vary, but most are relatively comfortable and well-maintained. The cost of a bus ticket in Burundi is around $5-$10 USD, depending on the route and distance. However, the road conditions can be poor, and the journey times can be long, so travelers should be prepared for delays and potential discomfort.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Bujumbura, Gitega | $0.50-$1 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10/km | Metered taxis are available, but prices can be negotiable |\n| Ride-Hailing | Bujumbura, Gitega | $5-$10 | Local alternatives to Uber and Grab are available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Bujumbura, Gitega | $2-$5 | A cheap and convenient way to get around cities |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Burundi, you will need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a local insurance policy.\n- The road conditions in Burundi can be poor, especially outside of the main cities, with many roads being unpaved and prone to flooding during the rainy season.\n- Fuel costs in Burundi are relatively high, with gasoline prices averaging around $1.50 USD per liter.\n- Car rental companies are available in the main cities, but the selection of vehicles can be limited, and prices can be high.\n- When driving in Burundi, you should be aware of the potential hazards, including poor road conditions, aggressive driving, and the risk of carjacking or robbery.\n- It is recommended to hire a driver or join a guided tour if you are not experienced with driving in Africa or are not familiar with the local road conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be prepared for delays and potential discomfort when traveling by bus or taxi, as the road conditions can be poor and the vehicles may not be well-maintained.\n- Always negotiate the price of a taxi or bus ticket before you start your journey, as prices can be negotiable.\n- Use a reputable and licensed taxi or bus company to avoid scams and ensure your safety.\n- Download a local ride-hailing app, such as Yego or SafeBoda, to get around cities and towns.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep a close eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Consider hiring a private vehicle and driver for the day, especially if you plan to travel outside of the main cities.\n- Learn some basic **Kirundi** phrases, such as \"Merci\" (thank you) and \"Où est...?\" (where is...?), to help you communicate with locals and get around.\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, especially when traveling to rural areas or visiting traditional villages.",
