  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Burundi varies significantly between public and private facilities, with public healthcare services being generally more affordable but often lacking in quality and availability, while private facilities offer better quality care at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $28 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 24.5% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112 or 113\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: BIF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nBurundi's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, while private facilities are better equipped and staffed, but often unaffordable for the average citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, with many relying on traditional healers and community health workers for basic medical needs. For foreigners, private facilities are often the preferred option, offering better quality care and more comprehensive services. However, even private facilities may lack specialized equipment and expertise, and medical evacuation to neighboring countries or Europe may be necessary for complex cases.\n\nThe need for health insurance in Burundi is significant, given the high out-of-pocket expenditure and the limited coverage of the public healthcare system. While there is no mandatory health insurance scheme, many employers offer private health insurance as part of their employee benefits package. Individuals can also purchase private health insurance plans, which can provide access to better quality care and more comprehensive coverage. However, the cost of private health insurance can be prohibitively expensive for many Burundians, highlighting the need for more affordable and accessible health insurance options.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have long wait times and limited availability of doctors |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private clinics may have more specialized doctors and equipment |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private dental clinics may offer more comprehensive services and modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Public hospitals may have limited eye care services and equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Private labs may offer more comprehensive testing and faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services and equipment |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$50 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations and better care |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Private clinics may have more experienced surgeons and better equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have limited maternity services and equipment |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Private clinics may have more modern equipment and faster results |\n| X-Ray | $10-$20 | Public hospitals may have limited radiology services and equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers more comprehensive services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers medical evacuation and repatriation, as well as more comprehensive services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** may cost between $5-$10 per prescription\n- **Prescription rules** may vary, with some medications available over-the-counter and others requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- **Pharmacy availability** may be limited in rural areas, with many relying on traditional healers and community health workers for basic medical needs\n- **Over-the-counter norms** may vary, with some medications available without a prescription and others requiring a doctor's note\n- **Vaccinations** may be available at public health clinics and private hospitals, with costs ranging from $10-$50 per vaccination\n- **Medication quality** may vary, with some medications being counterfeit or of poor quality, highlighting the need for caution when purchasing medications\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital or clinic. The emergency number in Burundi is 112 or 113, and ambulance services may be available in major cities.
