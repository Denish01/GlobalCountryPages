[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Burundi's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, while private facilities are better equipped and staffed, but often unaffordable for the average citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, with many relying on traditional healers and community health workers for basic medical needs. For foreigners, private facilities are often the preferred option, offering better quality care and more comprehensive services. However, even private facilities may lack specialized equipment and expertise, and medical evacuation to neighboring countries or Europe may be necessary for complex cases.

The need for health insurance in Burundi is significant, given the high out-of-pocket expenditure and the limited coverage of the public healthcare system. While there is no mandatory health insurance scheme, many employers offer private health insurance as part of their employee benefits package. Individuals can also purchase private health insurance plans, which can provide access to better quality care and more comprehensive coverage. However, the cost of private health insurance can be prohibitively expensive for many Burundians, highlighting the need for more affordable and accessible health insurance options.
