[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Burundi is relatively small compared to other countries in Africa, but it is growing rapidly, with an estimated annual growth rate of 3.1%. This growth is largely driven by a high total fertility rate, which is approximately 5.5 children per woman. The population is predominantly rural, with only about 13% of the population living in urban areas. However, urbanization is increasing, with many young people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Burundi's population is also characterized by a large youth demographic, with a median age of 17.5 years, which presents both opportunities and challenges for the country's development.

The population of Burundi has been affected by various factors, including poverty, conflict, and migration. The country has experienced several periods of conflict and instability, which have led to the displacement of people and the disruption of economic activities. Additionally, many Burundians have migrated to other countries in search of better economic opportunities, which has contributed to a significant diaspora community. Despite these challenges, the population of Burundi is resilient and diverse, with a strong cultural identity and a rich tradition of community and social cohesion.

The growth of the population in Burundi is also influenced by the country's high fertility rate, which is driven by a combination of factors, including limited access to family planning services, cultural and social norms, and a lack of education and economic opportunities. The government of Burundi has implemented various policies and programs aimed at reducing the fertility rate and promoting sustainable population growth, including the provision of family planning services and education and economic empowerment programs for women and girls.
