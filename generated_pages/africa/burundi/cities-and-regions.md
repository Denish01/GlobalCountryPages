[SECTION] How Burundi Is Divided [/SECTION]
Burundi is divided into 18 provinces, which are further divided into communes and then into collines. The provinces are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and they are responsible for providing various services to the population, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The provinces are also responsible for collecting taxes and implementing national policies at the local level. The administrative structure of Burundi is designed to be decentralized, with power and resources distributed among the provinces to promote local development and autonomy.

The provinces of Burundi are diverse in terms of geography, economy, and culture. Some provinces are located in the mountains, while others are in the valleys or along the shores of Lake Tanganyika. The provinces also vary in terms of their economic activities, with some being primarily agricultural, while others are focused on mining, manufacturing, or services. The cultural diversity of the provinces is also significant, with different provinces having their own unique traditions, languages, and customs.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Burundi has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with many roads and highways connecting the major cities and towns. The country also has a number of domestic airports, including the Bujumbura International Airport, which provides connections to other cities in Africa and around the world. However, the road network can be challenging, especially during the rainy season, and many roads are unpaved or in poor condition. There are also many buses and taxis available, which provide an affordable and convenient way to get around the country.

The best way to get around Burundi is by car, either by renting a vehicle or hiring a driver. This provides the most flexibility and allows travelers to explore the country at their own pace. However, it is also possible to use public transportation, such as buses and taxis, which are widely available and relatively affordable. It is also possible to fly between cities, although this can be more expensive than other modes of transportation. Overall, getting around Burundi requires some planning and flexibility, but it is possible to explore the country and experience its many attractions and activities.
