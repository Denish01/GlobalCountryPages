  "content": "The internet in Burundi is relatively underdeveloped, with limited coverage and slow speeds, especially outside of the capital city Gitega, but it is still possible to get connected with a SIM card or WiFi from various providers.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 2.5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Econet, Lumitel, Smart Mobile\nSIM Card Cost: 5 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Burundi is still in its early stages of development, with a significant urban-rural divide in terms of access and quality. While the capital city Gitega and other major towns have relatively better internet connectivity, rural areas often struggle with poor or non-existent coverage. The average internet speed in Burundi is around 2.5 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. However, the government and private sector are working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with plans to expand coverage and increase speeds in the coming years.\n\nDespite the challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for many Burundians, with a growing number of people using online services for communication, commerce, and education. However, the reliability of the internet can be a problem, with frequent outages and disruptions due to power cuts, network maintenance, and other technical issues. As a result, many users rely on mobile networks and SIM cards as a backup option, which can be more expensive but also more reliable than fixed-line internet.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Burundi, you can visit one of the main carriers' offices or authorized dealers, such as Econet, Lumitel, or Smart Mobile. You will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, as well as purchase a SIM card and a prepaid plan. The cost of a SIM card is around 5 USD, and data plans start from around 1 USD per day for 100 MB of data. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable dealer to avoid any scams or counterfeit products.\n\nYou can find SIM card vendors at major towns and cities, including Gitega, Bujumbura, and Ngozi. Some carriers also offer tourist-friendly plans, which can be a good option for short-term visitors. These plans usually include a set amount of data, voice minutes, and SMS, and can be purchased for a fixed period of time.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Econet | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 10 USD | Valid for 7 days |\n| Lumitel | Visitor Plan | 500 MB | 5 USD | Valid for 3 days |\n| Smart Mobile | Traveler Plan | 2 GB | 15 USD | Valid for 14 days |\n| Onatel | Internet Plan | 1 GB | 10 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many hotels and guesthouses offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not very common in Burundi, but some cafes and restaurants in major towns may offer WiFi to their customers\n- Coworking spaces are limited, but some cities like Gitega and Bujumbura have a few coworking spaces with reliable WiFi\n- Public WiFi is not widely available, but some government institutions and public buildings may offer free WiFi to visitors\n- Some restaurants and bars may also offer WiFi to their customers, especially in tourist areas\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Hub Gitega and Bujumbura Coworking Space offer reliable WiFi and a productive environment for remote workers\n- Reliable cafe chains like Cafe de la Paix and Cafe du Lac may offer WiFi and a comfortable working space\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and SIM cards can be useful in case of power cuts or network outages\n- Using a **VPN** can be necessary to access certain websites and online services that may be blocked in Burundi\n- Some hotels and guesthouses may also offer coworking spaces or business centers with reliable WiFi and other amenities\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Burundi, with some websites and online services blocked by the government\n- Using a **VPN** can help to bypass censorship and access blocked websites\n- Roaming alternatives like purchasing a local SIM card or using a mobile hotspot can be more cost-effective than roaming with your home carrier\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Burundi, but some carriers may offer eSIM plans for certain devices\n- Be aware of **cybersecurity** threats like phishing and malware, and take necessary precautions to protect your devices and data\n- Regular power cuts and network outages can disrupt internet services, so it's essential to have a backup plan and stay informed about any disruptions.",
