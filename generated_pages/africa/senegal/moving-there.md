Senegal is a popular destination for expats and travelers alike, offering a unique blend of African and French cultures. The country's vibrant capital city, Dakar, is a major draw, with its stunning coastline, rich history, and thriving music and arts scene. Many people move to Senegal for work, with the country's growing economy and strategic location making it an attractive hub for businesses and entrepreneurs. Others are drawn to the country's warm climate, beautiful beaches, and outdoor activities such as surfing and hiking.
