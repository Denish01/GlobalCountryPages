[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Senegal is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch**, headed by the President, is responsible for enforcing laws and overseeing the administration of the country. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and serves as both the head of state and head of government. The **legislative branch**, composed of the unicameral National Assembly, is responsible for making laws. The National Assembly has 165 members, also directly elected by the people for five-year terms. The **judicial branch**, composed of the Court of Cassation, the Council of State, and the Court of Auditors, is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring that they align with the constitution.

The political system in Senegal is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the three branches, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and powers. This separation is designed to prevent any one branch from dominating the others and to ensure that power is distributed evenly. Senegal has a **unitary system**, where the central government holds significant power and authority, and the country is divided into 14 regions for administrative purposes.

The government of Senegal has made significant progress in recent years in consolidating democracy and promoting **good governance**. The country has a long history of peaceful transitions of power and has made efforts to promote transparency and accountability in government. However, like many countries in the region, Senegal still faces challenges related to corruption, poverty, and inequality.
