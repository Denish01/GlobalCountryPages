[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Senegal has a lower-middle-income economy, with a mix of traditional and modern sectors. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with economic growth averaging around 6% per year. However, the economy still faces challenges such as a high unemployment rate, particularly among young people, and a dependence on a few key industries. The government has implemented policies to diversify the economy and improve the business environment, including the creation of a new investment code and the development of special economic zones.

Senegal's economy is driven by a combination of traditional sectors such as agriculture and fishing, and modern industries such as manufacturing and tourism. The country has a long coastline and a strategic location, making it an important hub for trade and commerce in West Africa. The government has also invested in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, ports, and airports, to improve the country's connectivity and competitiveness.

The country's economic classification as a lower-middle-income economy reflects its progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards. However, there is still a significant gap between the rich and the poor, and the government faces challenges in reducing inequality and promoting inclusive growth. The government has implemented policies to address these challenges, including the development of a national strategy for poverty reduction and the creation of programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
