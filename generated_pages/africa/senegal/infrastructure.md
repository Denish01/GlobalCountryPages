[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Senegal's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a mix of modern and outdated facilities. The government has invested heavily in recent years to improve the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy plants. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural infrastructure and the expansion of social services.

Despite these efforts, Senegal still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including a lack of reliable energy supply, inadequate transportation networks, and limited access to clean water and sanitation. The country is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which can exacerbate existing infrastructure challenges. To address these issues, the government has developed a comprehensive infrastructure plan, which includes investments in renewable energy, transportation, and water and sanitation infrastructure.

The plan also emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships and international cooperation in supporting Senegal's infrastructure development. With the help of international donors and private sector investors, Senegal has been able to secure significant funding for its infrastructure projects, including a major highway construction project and a new international airport. These investments are expected to have a positive impact on the country's economic development and quality of life for its citizens.
