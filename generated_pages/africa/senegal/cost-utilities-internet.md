[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Senegal is relatively well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to utilities than rural areas. The costs of utilities in Senegal are relatively stable, with minimal fluctuations, but there can be seasonal variations in electricity and water usage. For example, during the hot summer months, electricity usage tends to increase due to the use of air conditioning and fans, while water usage may decrease during the dry season.

The cost of utilities in Senegal is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including inflation and exchange rates. With an inflation rate of 0.8% in 2024, the cost of utilities is expected to remain relatively stable.
