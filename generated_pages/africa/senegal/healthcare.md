[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Senegal's healthcare system is structured around a network of public and private hospitals, clinics, and health centers. The public sector is primarily responsible for providing basic healthcare services, while the private sector offers more specialized and advanced care. The quality of care in Senegal is generally considered to be adequate, although it can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. Urban areas, such as Dakar, tend to have better-equipped and staffed facilities, while rural areas often struggle with limited access to healthcare services. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system and implementing policies to improve access to care.

The public healthcare system in Senegal is generally underfunded and understaffed, which can result in long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private sector offers more advanced and specialized care, although it can be expensive and may not be accessible to all segments of the population. Despite these challenges, Senegal has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including the introduction of new **health insurance** programs and the expansion of **vaccination** programs.

Overall, while Senegal's healthcare system has its challenges, it is generally considered to be adequate and improving. However, visitors and expats should still take precautions to ensure they have access to quality care, including purchasing **health insurance** and taking steps to prevent the spread of **infectious diseases**.
