  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Senegal can vary depending on factors such as location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $100 to $200.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($150 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.20 per kWh)\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Senegal is relatively well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to utilities than rural areas. The costs of utilities in Senegal are relatively stable, with minimal fluctuations, but there can be seasonal variations in electricity and water usage. For example, during the hot summer months, electricity usage tends to increase due to the use of air conditioning and fans, while water usage may decrease during the dry season.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Senegal is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including inflation and exchange rates. With an inflation rate of 0.8% in 2024, the cost of utilities is expected to remain relatively stable. However, the exchange rate between the XOF and USD can affect the cost of imported goods and services, including utilities. Overall, the utility costs in Senegal are relatively affordable, with the average monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment ranging from $100 to $200.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (not always available) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in rent or separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$140** | **$200** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Orange, Tigo |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Orange, Tigo |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Orange, Tigo, Expresso |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Orange, Tigo, Expresso |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Orange, Tigo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Deezer, Canal+ Afrique) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Senegal, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as Senelec for electricity and Sones for water, and provide the necessary documentation, including proof of address and identity.\n- Prepaid electricity is a common option in Senegal, allowing users to pay for their electricity usage in advance, but postpaid plans are also available for those who prefer to receive a monthly bill.\n- The best internet providers in Senegal are Orange and Tigo, offering a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transportation or walk/bike when possible.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with landlords or property managers to include utility costs in the rent, which can help to simplify the billing process and reduce the risk of unexpected costs.",
