The country's **inflation rate** of 0.8% in 2024 has helped keep prices stable, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expats.

However, the capital city of Dakar has a vibrant restaurant scene, with a range of options from street food to fine dining.\n\nThe cost of food in Senegal is driven by factors such as **seasonality**, **transportation costs**, and **import duties**. The country is a significant producer of **agricultural products** such as peanuts, millet, and sorghum, which helps keep prices low for these staples. However, imported goods such as **meat** and **dairy products** can be more expensive due to high transportation costs and import duties. Overall, Senegal offers a great value for money when it comes to food, with a wide range of affordable options available for both locals and visitors.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 900 XOF | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 750 XOF | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.50 | 1,500 XOF | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 600 XOF | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $4.00 | 2,500 XOF | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 3,500 XOF | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 1,800 XOF | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 900 XOF | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 600 XOF | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 500 XOF | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00 | 3,000 XOF | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 600 XOF | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes such as **thieboudienne** or **yassa**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | (3 courses, **French-inspired cuisine**) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | (upscale, **international cuisine**) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Senegal can be significant, with **supermarkets** often charging higher prices for the same items.
