  "content": "The cost of education in Senegal varies depending on the type of institution and level of study, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools and international institutions can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 6.2%\nLiteracy Rate: 51.9%\nSchool System: 6 years of primary education, 4 years of secondary education, and 3 years of upper secondary education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Senegal is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being generally considered to be of lower quality due to limited resources and infrastructure. The language of instruction is primarily French, although some schools may offer instruction in local languages. Compulsory education in Senegal lasts for 6 years, from the age of 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. However, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the region and type of institution. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula including French, British, and American systems.\n\nPrivate schools in Senegal, on the other hand, are generally considered to be of higher quality, with better facilities and more qualified teachers. However, they can be expensive, and are often out of reach for many Senegalese families. International schools are also available, catering to the needs of expatriate families and offering a range of curricula. These schools are often very expensive, but offer a high-quality education and a range of extracurricular activities. Despite the challenges facing the education system in Senegal, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with enrollment rates increasing and more children accessing education than ever before.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and infrastructure |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Range of quality and facilities |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and infrastructure |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,000 | Range of quality and facilities |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Curriculum types include French, British, and American systems |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$300 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs and facilities |\n| Private University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of programs and facilities |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$3,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar (UCAD) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability and quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Range of subjects and qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | French and local languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic materials and equipment |\n| School Uniform | $10-$20 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar (UCAD)** is one of the top-ranked universities in Senegal, offering a range of programs and facilities.\n- **Scholarships** are available for students from low-income backgrounds, although the application process can be competitive.\n- **Online learning options** are limited in Senegal, although some universities and institutions offer distance learning programs.\n- The **quality of education** in Senegal is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, although there are some excellent schools and institutions.\n- **Expats** may find that international schools offer the best option for their children, although these can be expensive.\n- **Language skills** are essential for success in Senegal, with French being the primary language of instruction, although local languages such as Wolof and Pulaar are also spoken.",
