  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Senegal can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private healthcare services, with public services generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources, while private services can be more expensive but offer better facilities and care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $73 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 44.3% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 15 or 18\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XOF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSenegal's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and long wait times, while the private sector offers more modern facilities and better-trained staff, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and expats may prefer to use private healthcare services. It is recommended to have health insurance in Senegal, as the cost of medical care can be high, especially in private facilities.\n\nThe healthcare system in Senegal is also divided between urban and rural areas, with more facilities and better-equipped hospitals located in cities like Dakar, while rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services. This can make it difficult for people living in rural areas to access medical care, especially in emergency situations. Additionally, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the facility and the doctor, so it's essential to research and choose a reputable hospital or clinic.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-70 | Prices vary by dentist and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-20 | $30-70 | Prices vary by optometrist and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $20-50 | Prices vary by lab and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-500 | Prices vary by type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $200-500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $100-200 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $20-50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-200 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist care, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-500 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and markets\n- Prices for medication vary by type and brand, but generally range from $5-20 per prescription\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- It's recommended to purchase medication from licensed pharmacies to ensure authenticity and quality\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts or promotions, so it's worth shopping around\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the local emergency number, 15 or 18, or go to the nearest hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners and expats in Senegal are generally located in Dakar, such as the Dakar University Hospital or the Clinique des Nations. These hospitals have better-equipped facilities and more trained staff, but may be more expensive than public hospitals. It's also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency situations, such as having a list of emergency contacts and knowing the location of the nearest hospital.\n\nAmbulance services are available in Senegal, but may be limited in rural areas. It's essential to research and choose a reputable ambulance service, and to have a plan in place for emergency transportation. Additionally, it's recommended to learn some basic French phrases, such as \"pompiers\" (fire department) or \"hôpital\" (hospital), in case of an emergency. Overall, while the healthcare system in Senegal can be challenging, with some planning and research, it's possible to access quality medical care and stay safe in the country.",
