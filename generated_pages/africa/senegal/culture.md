# Senegal Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Senegal's culture is a unique blend of African, French, and Islamic influences. The country has a diverse ethnic makeup, with the Wolof, Serer, and Pular being the largest groups. The Wolof people, who make up about 43% of the population, have had a significant impact on the country's culture, particularly in the areas of music, dance, and cuisine. The official language, French, is widely spoken, but many Senegalese people also speak local languages such as Wolof and Serer. The country's strategic location at the westernmost point of Africa has made it a crossroads of trade and cultural exchange for centuries, shaping its distinct cultural identity.

The Senegalese people are known for their hospitality and warm welcome to visitors. The concept of **teranga**, or hospitality, is deeply ingrained in Senegalese culture, and visitors are often greeted with a warm smile and an offer of food or drink. The country's cultural heritage is also reflected in its vibrant arts scene, which includes music, dance, and visual arts. The **Griot** tradition, a centuries-old practice of oral storytelling and music, is an important part of Senegalese culture, with Griots serving as historians, musicians, and entertainers.

Senegal's cultural identity is also shaped by its history as a French colony. The country gained independence in 1960, but the legacy of colonialism can still be seen in its language, architecture, and cuisine. Many Senegalese people have adapted French customs and traditions to their own unique cultural practices, creating a distinct blend of African and European influences. This blend is reflected in the country's modern art scene, which combines traditional techniques with contemporary styles and themes.

Eating customs in Senegal are an important part of the country's culture. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to socialize and bond with family and friends. In many Senegalese households, meals are eaten from a shared plate, using the right hand to scoop up food. It is considered impolite to eat with the left hand, as the left hand is associated with personal hygiene. Visitors are often invited to share meals with their hosts, and it is customary to bring a small gift, such as a bottle of juice or a box of pastries.
