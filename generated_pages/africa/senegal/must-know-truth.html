        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Senegal, a sovereign country located in West Africa, has a rich and diverse history that spans over a thousand years. The area that is now Senegal was inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the Wolof, Serer, and Fulani, before the arrival of European colonizers. In the 15th century, the Portuguese established trade posts along the coast, followed by the French, who began to exert control over the region in the 17th century. Senegal became a French colony in 1895, with Dakar as its capital. The country remained under French rule until it gained independence on April 4, 1960.</p>
        <p>The road to independence was marked by a series of key events, including the formation of the <strong>African Democratic Rally</strong> (RDA) in 1946, a pan-African movement that aimed to unite African countries under a single banner. In 1958, Senegal became an autonomous republic within the French Community, with <strong>Léopold Sédar Senghor</strong> as its first president. Senghor, a renowned poet and politician, played a crucial role in negotiating Senegal's independence from France.</p>
        <p>Senegal's independence was formally recognized by France on April 4, 1960, with Senghor as the country's first president. The new government faced significant challenges, including poverty, lack of infrastructure, and a dependence on French aid. However, under Senghor's leadership, Senegal made significant progress in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic development. The country also became a key player in regional and international affairs, hosting the <strong>Organization of African Unity</strong> (OAU) in 1968.</p>
        <p>In the decades that followed, Senegal continued to evolve and grow, with a series of peaceful transfers of power and a commitment to democratic principles. Today, the country is a <strong>multiparty democracy</strong>, with a diverse economy and a rich cultural heritage. Despite facing numerous challenges, including poverty and inequality, Senegal remains a stable and vibrant nation, with a strong sense of national identity and a deep connection to its African roots.</p>
