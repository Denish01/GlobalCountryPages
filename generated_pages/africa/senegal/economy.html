        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Senegal has a lower-middle-income economy, with a mix of traditional and modern sectors. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with economic growth averaging around 6% per year. However, the economy still faces challenges such as a high unemployment rate, particularly among young people, and a dependence on a few key industries. The government has implemented policies to diversify the economy and improve the business environment, including the creation of a new investment code and the development of special economic zones.</p>
        <p>Senegal's economy is driven by a combination of traditional sectors such as agriculture and fishing, and modern industries such as manufacturing and tourism.
