[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Senegal is a sovereign country located in West Africa, bordered by five countries: Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast, Guinea-Bissau to the southwest, and Gambia to the west. The country's unique shape, with a long, narrow strip of land along the Gambia River, makes it a significant player in regional trade and commerce. The Atlantic Ocean lies to the west of Senegal, providing a **coastline** of 531 kilometers.

The country's strategic location at the westernmost point of Africa makes it an important hub for maritime trade and cultural exchange. The **Cap-Vert** peninsula, where the capital city Dakar is located, is the westernmost point of the African continent. Senegal's borders have been shaped by its history as a French colony, and the country's language, culture, and cuisine reflect this legacy. The **Senegal River**, which forms the border with Mauritania, is an important source of water and transportation for the country.

The country's highest point, **Népin Cliff**, is located in the southeast, near the border with Guinea. The **Fouta Djallon highlands**, which stretch across the eastern part of the country, are a significant feature of Senegal's landscape. This region is home to a diverse range of **flora and fauna**, including many species of trees, birds, and mammals.

The **Senegal River**, which flows through the north of the country, is an important source of water and transportation. The river delta, where the river meets the ocean, is a **wetland** area of great ecological importance, with many species of birds, fish, and other aquatic life. The **coastal zone**, which includes the capital city Dakar, is a densely populated region with a mix of urban and rural landscapes. The **desert** region of the north, which borders Mauritania, is a sparsely populated area with a harsh climate and limited vegetation.
