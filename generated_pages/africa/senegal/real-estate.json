The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a focus on urban areas such as Dakar and other major cities. The price trajectory is generally upward, with an average annual increase of 5-10% in the past few years. Urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, with the capital city Dakar being the most expensive. However, the rural areas are also experiencing growth, particularly in the tourism sector, with many foreigners investing in properties in coastal areas.\n\nThe current market conditions are favorable for investors, with a range of properties available, from luxury apartments to commercial buildings. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote the real estate sector, including tax incentives and infrastructure development. The trend is shifting towards more modern and sustainable properties, with a focus on energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. This is driven by the growing demand for eco-friendly properties, particularly among foreign investors.\n\nThe market is also experiencing an increase in demand for rental properties, particularly in urban areas. This is driven by the growing expat community and the increasing number of businesses setting up operations in the country. The rental yields are relatively high, with an average yield of 5-7% per annum. However, the market is not without its challenges, with issues such as corruption and bureaucracy affecting the buying and selling process.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dakar Plateau | 2,000 | 500 | Apartment |\n| Almadies | 1,800 | 400 | Villa |\n| Yoff | 1,500 | 300 | House |\n| Saint-Louis | 1,000 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Thiès | 800 | 150 | House |\n| Kaolack | 600 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Ziguinchor | 500 | 80 | House |\n| Tambacounda | 400 | 60 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Senegal, but they must obtain a **residence permit** before making a purchase.\n- Foreign companies can also buy property, but they must be registered with the **Senegalese authorities**.\n- There are no restrictions on the type of property that foreigners can buy, but they must comply with **local zoning regulations**.\n- Foreigners must also obtain a **tax identification number** before making a purchase.\n- Foreigners can also lease property, with a maximum lease period of 99 years.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
