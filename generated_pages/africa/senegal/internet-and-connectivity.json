  "content": "The internet in Senegal is relatively well-developed, with good mobile network coverage and a growing number of options for getting online, making it a viable destination for remote workers and tourists alike.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 10 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Good\nMain Carriers: Orange, Tigo, Expresso\nSIM Card Cost: 5 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Common\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Senegal has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with the average internet speed increasing to 10 Mbps download. However, there is still a notable urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable connections available in cities like Dakar and Thiès, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite these challenges, the internet is generally reliable, with most users able to access basic online services like email and social media without major issues.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, Senegal has a well-developed mobile network, with good coverage across the country, including in rural areas. This has helped to increase access to the internet, particularly in areas where fixed-line connections are not available. However, the lack of fiber-optic connections in many parts of the country means that speeds can be slower than in other parts of the world. Additionally, power outages can be a problem, particularly during the rainy season, which can affect internet availability.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Senegal is relatively straightforward, with several mobile carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers, including Orange, Tigo, and Expresso, have shops and authorized retailers throughout the country, where you can purchase a SIM card and register for a plan. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some carriers may have additional requirements. Recommended carriers for tourists include Orange and Tigo, which offer a range of data plans and have good coverage across the country.\n\nOnce you have purchased a SIM card, you can register for a data plan, which can range in price from around 1,000 to 10,000 XOF (approximately 1.50 to 15 USD) per month, depending on the carrier and the amount of data you need. It's worth noting that some carriers may offer special promotions or discounts for tourists, so it's worth shopping around to find the best deal.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Orange | Prepaid | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Tigo | Tourist Plan | 2 GB | 10 | Valid for 30 days, includes international calls |\n| Expresso | Data Plan | 5 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days, includes streaming services |\n| Sonatel | Prepaid | 1 GB | 3 | Valid for 30 days, only available for Senegalese citizens |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many hotels and guesthouses offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is growing, with many cafes and restaurants in Dakar and other major cities offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more popular, particularly in Dakar, with many offering high-speed internet and other amenities\n- Public WiFi is not always available, but some cities and towns have public WiFi hotspots, particularly in tourist areas\n- Some shopping malls and airports also offer free WiFi, although the quality can vary\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Hub Dakar and JokkoLabs offer high-speed internet and other amenities, making them a good option for remote workers\n- Reliable cafe chains like Cafe de Rome and Cafe du Senegal offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and satellite internet can be useful in case of outages or slow speeds\n- VPNs can be necessary to access certain websites and services, particularly if you are working with sensitive data\n- Some hotels and guesthouses also offer coworking spaces and other amenities, making them a good option for remote workers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not generally a problem in Senegal, but some websites and services may be blocked, particularly those related to piracy or adult content\n- Using a VPN can help to access blocked sites and protect your online security\n- Roaming alternatives like purchasing a local SIM card or using a portable WiFi hotspot can be more cost-effective than using your home carrier's roaming services\n- eSIM options are not always available, so it's worth checking with your carrier before traveling to Senegal\n- Be aware of your data usage and avoid using public WiFi for sensitive activities, as it may not be secure\n- Keep your devices and software up to date to protect against cyber threats and malware",
