[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Senegal is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being generally considered to be of lower quality due to limited resources and infrastructure. The language of instruction is primarily French, although some schools may offer instruction in local languages. Compulsory education in Senegal lasts for 6 years, from the age of 6 to 12, and is free for all citizens. However, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the region and type of institution. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula including French, British, and American systems.

Private schools in Senegal, on the other hand, are generally considered to be of higher quality, with better facilities and more qualified teachers. However, they can be expensive, and are often out of reach for many Senegalese families. International schools are also available, catering to the needs of expatriate families and offering a range of curricula. These schools are often very expensive, but offer a high-quality education and a range of extracurricular activities. Despite the challenges facing the education system in Senegal, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with enrollment rates increasing and more children accessing education than ever before.
