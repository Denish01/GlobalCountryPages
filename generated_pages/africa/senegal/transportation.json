This airport serves as a major hub for West Africa and offers direct flights to several European and African cities, including Paris, Brussels, and Casablanca. Another important airport is the Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport (DKR), which is located in Dakar and serves as a hub for regional flights. Overland entry points into Senegal include the borders with Mauritania, Mali, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and The Gambia, which can be crossed by bus or private vehicle.\n\nFor travelers coming from neighboring countries, there are several overland entry points, including the Rosso border crossing with Mauritania and the Kidira border crossing with Mali. These border crossings can be busy, especially during peak travel seasons, so it's a good idea to plan ahead and research the necessary documentation and procedures. Additionally, many travelers arrive in Senegal by sea, with the Port of Dakar being a major hub for cargo and passenger ships.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic flights in Senegal are limited, but there are a few airlines that offer flights between major cities, including Dakar, Saint-Louis, and Ziguinchor. The main domestic airline is Air Senegal, which operates flights to several destinations within the country. Booking domestic flights can be done online or through a local travel agent, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 USD per person, depending on the route and class of service.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nUnfortunately, Senegal does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option within the country. However, there are plans to develop a rail system in the future, which would connect major cities and improve transportation infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus companies in Senegal, such as Dakar Dem Dikk and Senebus, offer a convenient and affordable way to travel between major cities. These buses are generally comfortable and well-maintained, with air conditioning and reclining seats. Routes and schedules vary depending on the company and time of year, but most buses run regularly between major cities like Dakar, Saint-Louis, and Kaolack.
