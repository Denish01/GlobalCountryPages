[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Senegal has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with the average internet speed increasing to 10 Mbps download. However, there is still a notable urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable connections available in cities like Dakar and Thiès, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite these challenges, the internet is generally reliable, with most users able to access basic online services like email and social media without major issues.

In terms of infrastructure, Senegal has a well-developed mobile network, with good coverage across the country, including in rural areas. This has helped to increase access to the internet, particularly in areas where fixed-line connections are not available. However, the lack of fiber-optic connections in many parts of the country means that speeds can be slower than in other parts of the world. Additionally, power outages can be a problem, particularly during the rainy season, which can affect internet availability.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Senegal is relatively straightforward, with several mobile carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers, including Orange, Tigo, and Expresso, have shops and authorized retailers throughout the country, where you can purchase a SIM card and register for a plan. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some carriers may have additional requirements. Recommended carriers for tourists include Orange and Tigo, which offer a range of data plans and have good coverage across the country.

Once you have purchased a SIM card, you can register for a data plan, which can range in price from around 1,000 to 10,000 XOF (approximately 1.50 to 15 USD) per month, depending on the carrier and the amount of data you need. It's worth noting that some carriers may offer special promotions or discounts for tourists, so it's worth shopping around to find the best deal.
