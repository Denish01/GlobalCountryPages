[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Senegal is diverse, with many languages spoken across the country. While French is the official language and used in government, education, and formal settings, Wolof is the most widely spoken language and is often used as a **lingua franca**. Other languages, such as Pulaar and Serer, are also widely spoken, particularly in rural areas. Regional dialects and minority languages are also present, reflecting the country's cultural diversity. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of tourist areas and major cities, so visitors may need to rely on French or Wolof to communicate.

The use of language in Senegal is often determined by the context and the level of formality. In formal settings, such as government offices and schools, French is typically used, while Wolof is more commonly used in informal settings, such as markets and social gatherings. The use of English is generally limited to tourist areas and major cities, where it is used as a **second language** by some locals.

Overall, the language situation in Senegal is complex, with many languages spoken and used in different contexts. Visitors to the country would benefit from learning some basic phrases in Wolof and French, which would help them to communicate and navigate the country more easily.
