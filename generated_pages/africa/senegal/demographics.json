This growth is largely driven by a high fertility rate, which stands at approximately 4.1 children per woman. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 19 years, and an urban population that accounts for about 46% of the total population. Senegal's population is also characterized by a significant rural-urban migration trend, with many young people moving to cities such as Dakar in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe country's population size is significant in the West African region, and its growth trends have important implications for the country's economic development, healthcare, and education systems. The population growth rate also puts pressure on the country's natural resources, infrastructure, and social services. However, Senegal has made significant progress in recent years in reducing poverty and improving living standards, and the country is expected to continue to experience rapid population growth in the coming years.\n\nSenegal's population is also characterized by a significant diaspora community, with many Senegalese living and working abroad, particularly in countries such as France, Italy, and the United States.
