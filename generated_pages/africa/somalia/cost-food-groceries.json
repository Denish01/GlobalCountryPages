However, the cost of food can fluctuate depending on various factors such as the season, conflict, and economic conditions. Somalia has a vibrant eating-out culture, with many restaurants and street food stalls serving traditional dishes like **sabaayad** (flatbread) and **hilib ari** (goat meat). However, home cooking is also a significant part of Somali cuisine, with many families preparing meals at home using fresh ingredients from local markets.\n\nThe prices of food in Somalia are driven by various factors, including the cost of transportation, conflict, and economic conditions. The country's economy is largely dependent on imports, which can lead to fluctuations in food prices. Additionally, the lack of infrastructure and transportation networks can make it difficult to access certain areas, leading to higher prices in some regions. Despite these challenges, Somalia has a rich culinary tradition, with a focus on fresh ingredients, spices, and traditional cooking methods.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 8,000 SOS | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 2,500 SOS | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 6,000 SOS | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 5,000 SOS | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 18,000 SOS | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00 | 25,000 SOS | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50 | 12,000 SOS | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.20 | 6,000 SOS | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 4,000 SOS | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 3,000 SOS | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 20,000 SOS | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50 | 2,500 SOS | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | **sabaayad**, **hilib ari** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | one person, traditional dishes |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$25 | 3 courses, moderate prices |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | upscale, international cuisine |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $7-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Somalia.
