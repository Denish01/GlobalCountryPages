[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Somalia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering services. However, the system is severely underfunded and understaffed, with a significant shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, but these are often limited to basic care and are not always accessible, especially in rural areas. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer more comprehensive services, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Somalis. The quality of care in Somalia is generally poor, with inadequate facilities, equipment, and supplies, as well as a lack of trained healthcare professionals.

The healthcare system in Somalia is also heavily reliant on international aid and support, with many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations providing healthcare services and funding. However, this support is often fragmented and unpredictable, which can make it difficult to maintain consistent and high-quality healthcare services. Additionally, the ongoing conflict and instability in Somalia have had a devastating impact on the healthcare system, with many healthcare facilities and professionals being targeted or forced to flee.

In urban areas, such as Mogadishu, there are more healthcare options available, including private hospitals and clinics, but these are often expensive and may not be accessible to all. In rural areas, healthcare options are extremely limited, and many people have to travel long distances to access even basic medical care. The Somali government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the development of a national health policy and the establishment of a ministry of health, but much work remains to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system.
