  "content": "Healthcare in Somalia is a challenging and complex system, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and a general lack of access to quality medical facilities and services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 888\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nSomalia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering services. However, the system is severely underfunded and understaffed, with a significant shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, but these are often limited to basic care and are not always accessible, especially in rural areas. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer more comprehensive services, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Somalis. The quality of care in Somalia is generally poor, with inadequate facilities, equipment, and supplies, as well as a lack of trained healthcare professionals.\n\nThe healthcare system in Somalia is also heavily reliant on international aid and support, with many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations providing healthcare services and funding. However, this support is often fragmented and unpredictable, which can make it difficult to maintain consistent and high-quality healthcare services. Additionally, the ongoing conflict and instability in Somalia have had a devastating impact on the healthcare system, with many healthcare facilities and professionals being targeted or forced to flee.\n\nIn urban areas, such as Mogadishu, there are more healthcare options available, including private hospitals and clinics, but these are often expensive and may not be accessible to all. In rural areas, healthcare options are extremely limited, and many people have to travel long distances to access even basic medical care. The Somali government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the development of a national health policy and the establishment of a ministry of health, but much work remains to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mogadishu Central Hospital | Mogadishu | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Medina Hospital | Mogadishu | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Keysaney Hospital | Mogadishu | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatric care | Yes |\n| Galcayo Hospital | Galcayo | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Kismayo Hospital | Kismayo | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| SOS Hospital | Mogadishu | Private | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all visitors and expats, as it can provide access to better quality healthcare services and facilities.\n- **Local insurance options** are limited, but some private insurance companies offer health insurance plans for Somalis and expats.\n- **International health insurance** is also available, and can provide more comprehensive coverage and access to healthcare services outside of Somalia.\n- **Expats and foreigners** are often required to have health insurance as a condition of their visa or employment contract.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the type and level of coverage, as well as the provider and location.\n- **Group health insurance plans** may be available for companies and organizations with multiple employees or members.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are often in short supply, and may not always be available, especially in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** can be limited, and many medications may be available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications may not always be available, and generic or local brands may be more common.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the type and brand of medication, as well as the location and provider.\n- **Pharmacy access** is limited, especially in rural areas, and many people may have to travel long distances to access a pharmacy or healthcare facility.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include yellow fever, hepatitis A, and typhoid, as well as all routine vaccinations.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis B, rabies, and meningitis, depending on the location and activities.\n- **Endemic diseases** include malaria, cholera, and tuberculosis, and visitors should take precautions to prevent these diseases.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and visitors should avoid drinking untreated water or eating unpeeled fruits and vegetables.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and visitors should avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables.\n- **Insect-borne diseases** such as malaria and dengue fever are common, and visitors should take precautions to prevent these diseases, such as using insecticide-treated bed nets and wearing insect repellent.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Somalia, due to the limited availability of high-quality healthcare services and facilities.\n- **Some private hospitals** in Mogadishu and other urban areas may offer specialized medical services, such as surgical procedures or dental care.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for some medical procedures, but the quality and safety of these services can vary widely.\n- **Accreditation** is not always available, and visitors should research and carefully evaluate any healthcare provider or facility before seeking care.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, visitors should call the emergency number, 888, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or healthcare facility.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can be limited, and visitors may need to rely on private transportation or other means to access medical care.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be located in urban areas, such as Mogadishu, and visitors should research and know the location of these facilities in case of an emergency.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, and visitors should carefully review their insurance policy and follow all necessary procedures to file a claim.\n- **Emergency care** may be limited, and visitors should be prepared for the possibility of evacuation to a nearby country or medical facility.",
