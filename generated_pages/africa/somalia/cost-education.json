  "content": "The cost of education in Somalia varies greatly depending on the type of institution and the student's nationality, with public education being largely free or subsidized, while private and international schools can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 0.0% (2023)\nLiteracy Rate: 38% (approximate)\nSchool System: 8 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: SOS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Somalia is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. However, due to the country's tumultuous past, the public education system has faced significant challenges, including a lack of funding, infrastructure, and qualified teachers. As a result, the quality of education in public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and sanitation facilities. In contrast, private schools in Somalia tend to offer higher-quality education, with better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum. The language of instruction in Somali schools is primarily Somali and Arabic, although some private schools may offer English-language instruction.\n\nThe compulsory education years in Somalia are from age 6 to 14, with students typically attending primary school for 4 years and secondary school for 4 years. However, due to the country's fragile education system, many students do not complete their compulsory education, and some may attend school irregularly or not at all. International schools are available in major cities such as Mogadishu, but they are relatively rare and tend to cater to the children of expatriates and wealthy Somalis. These schools often offer a curriculum based on international standards, such as the International Baccalaureate or the British GCSE.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can be inconsistent, with limited resources |\n| Private Primary | $100-$500 | Range depends on school tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can be inconsistent, with limited resources |\n| Private Secondary | $200-$1,000 | Range depends on school tier and location |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Curriculum types include IB, GCSE, and American |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs and resources |\n| Private University | $500-$2,000 | $1,000-$3,000 | Range depends on institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Mogadishu University is a top-ranked institution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$50 | Limited availability, especially outside urban areas |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Common for students who need extra support |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $30-$50 | Arabic, English, and Somali language courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic supplies such as textbooks, pens, and paper |\n| School Uniform | $10-$30 | Required for most schools, with prices varying by institution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Somalia are typically international schools, which offer a high-quality education based on international standards.\n- Scholarship availability is limited in Somalia, but some private institutions and organizations may offer scholarships to deserving students.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Somalia, especially for students who cannot access traditional education due to conflict or displacement.\n- Education quality in Somalia is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, due to the country's fragile education system and limited resources.\n- Students who wish to pursue higher education abroad may need to take additional exams or courses to meet international standards.\n- **Language skills** are essential for students in Somalia, with Somali, Arabic, and English being the most commonly spoken languages.",
