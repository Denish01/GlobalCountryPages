[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Somalia is located in the eastern part of Africa, commonly referred to as the **Horn of Africa**. It is situated on the coastline of the Indian Ocean and borders three countries: Djibouti to the northwest, Ethiopia to the west, and Kenya to the southwest. The country's strategic location allows it to control the southern entrance to the **Bab-el-Mandeb** strait, which connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. Somalia's coastline stretches for over 3,300 kilometers, providing ample access to the Indian Ocean and its rich marine resources.

The country's borders have been a subject of contention over the years, with disputes arising from the colonial-era demarcations. The border with Ethiopia, in particular, has been a source of tension, with both countries claiming ownership of the **Ogaden** region. Despite these challenges, Somalia's location has also facilitated trade and cultural exchange with its neighbors and the wider world. The country's ports, such as **Mogadishu** and **Kismayo**, have long been important centers of commerce, connecting the region to the global economy.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Somalia's terrain is characterized by a mix of **mountains**, **deserts**, and **coastal plains**. The northern part of the country is dominated by the **Ogo Mountains**, which stretch from the Ethiopian border to the Gulf of Aden. The highest point in the country, **Shimbiris**, is located in this range. The central and southern regions are mostly flat, with the **Haud** plateau covering much of the area. The Haud is a vast, arid region that is home to numerous **wadis**, or dry riverbeds, which fill with water during the rainy season.

The coastal plains, which stretch along the Indian Ocean, are generally narrow and flat, with numerous **beaches** and **coves**. The **Juba River** and the **Shabelle River** are the two main rivers in the country, flowing through the southern region and providing water for irrigation and drinking. Somalia's landscape is also dotted with **acacia trees** and other **thorny vegetation**, which are well adapted to the country's arid climate. The absence of dense **forests** and the limited **agricultural land** make Somalia's environment challenging for human habitation and economic development.

The country's **desert regions**, including the **Chalbi Desert** and the **Migiurtinia**, cover much of the northern and central areas. These deserts are characterized by extreme heat, limited vegetation, and scarce water resources. Despite the harsh conditions, the deserts are home to a variety of **wildlife**, including **gazelles**, **antelopes**, and **lions**. The **coastal ecosystems**, including **coral reefs** and **mangrove forests**, are also important habitats for **marine life**, such as **turtles**, **dolphins**, and **whales**.
