The rental market in urban areas such as Mogadishu is relatively competitive, with a range of options available, from basic rooms to larger apartments and houses. Typical lease terms are short, ranging from 6 to 12 months, and often require a deposit of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes over rent and eviction are common. Compared to regional neighbors, Somalia's housing costs are relatively low, but the lack of infrastructure and services can make living conditions challenging.\n\nThe housing market in Somalia is also influenced by the country's history of conflict and displacement, with many people living in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) or in informal settlements. The government has initiated efforts to improve the housing sector, including the development of new housing projects and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant housing needs of the population. Somalia's housing costs are generally lower than those in neighboring countries such as Djibouti and Kenya, but higher than those in Ethiopia.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | Basic, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $150-$300 | Simple, self-contained |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$600 | $250-$450 | Family size, some amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$1,000 | $400-$800 | Spacious, modern amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,000-$2,500 | Prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $500-$1,500 | Residential areas, some amenities |\n| Rural | $100-$500 | Limited infrastructure, basic services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Hamar Weyne: a historic neighborhood in the heart of Mogadishu, with a range of accommodation options and access to amenities, rent range $200-$500 USD per month\n- Hodan: a bustling neighborhood with a mix of residential and commercial areas, some modern amenities, rent range $150-$350 USD per month\n- Waberi: a relatively safe and secure neighborhood with a range of accommodation options, some amenities, rent range $100-$250 USD per month\n- Abdiaziz: a historic neighborhood with a range of accommodation options, some amenities, rent range $150-$300 USD per month\n- Yaqshid: a relatively modern neighborhood with some amenities, rent range $200-$400 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Somalia [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods carefully, considering factors such as security, access to amenities, and transportation\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable property\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease, and ensure that any necessary repairs are carried out\n- Be aware of potential scams, such as fake property listings or rental agreements\n- Utilities such as electricity and water are often not included in the rent, and may need to be arranged separately\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished ones, but may be available for an additional cost\n- Consider hiring a local guide or fixer to help navigate the rental market and negotiate with landlords.",
