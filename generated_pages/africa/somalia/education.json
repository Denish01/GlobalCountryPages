  "content": "The education system in Somalia is a complex and evolving entity, with a mix of public and private institutions, and a range of challenges and opportunities for students and educators alike. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 38%\nSchool System: 8 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Somali\nAcademic Calendar: 9 months\nInternational Schools: limited\nTop University Ranking: ranked 1500+ globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Somalia is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle lasts for four years and the second cycle lasts for four years. Secondary education, which is not compulsory, is divided into two types: general secondary education and technical secondary education. General secondary education lasts for four years and prepares students for university, while technical secondary education lasts for three years and prepares students for vocational training. Tertiary education is provided by universities and colleges, and includes undergraduate and graduate programs. The quality of education in Somalia varies greatly, with public schools often lacking resources and qualified teachers, while private schools tend to have better facilities and more qualified staff.\n\nThe public education system in Somalia is free, but it is often underfunded and understaffed. Many public schools lack basic amenities such as desks, chairs, and toilets, and teachers are often underqualified and underpaid. In contrast, private schools in Somalia are often well-equipped and staffed with qualified teachers, but they are expensive and out of reach for many Somalis. As a result, many Somali students opt to study abroad, particularly in neighboring countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia.\n\nDespite the challenges it faces, the education system in Somalia has made significant progress in recent years, with the number of students enrolled in school increasing and the literacy rate improving. However, much work remains to be done to improve the quality and accessibility of education in Somalia, particularly for girls and women, who are often disadvantaged when it comes to access to education.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
