  "content": "The population of Somalia is approximately 18.1 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that shape the country's demographics and culture.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 18.1 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 2.9%\nMedian Age: 18.5 years\nUrban Population: 39%\nPopulation Density: 28 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 58 years\nFertility Rate: 6.7 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nSomalia's population size is significant in the context of the African continent, with a growth rate that is among the highest in the world. The country's population is expected to continue growing, driven by a high total fertility rate and a relatively young population. Urbanization is also on the rise, with many Somalis moving to cities such as Mogadishu, Hargeisa, and Kismayo in search of better economic opportunities and services. However, this rapid urbanization has also put a strain on the country's infrastructure and resources. Migration patterns in Somalia are also influenced by conflict, drought, and poverty, with many Somalis seeking refuge in neighboring countries or migrating to other parts of the world in search of a better life.\n\nThe population of Somalia is also affected by the country's history of conflict and instability, which has led to a significant diaspora community. Many Somalis have fled the country to escape violence, persecution, or poverty, and have settled in countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This diaspora community plays an important role in supporting families and communities back in Somalia, and also contributes to the country's economy through remittances.\n\nDespite the challenges it faces, Somalia's population is also characterized by a strong sense of resilience and adaptability. Many Somalis have developed coping mechanisms to deal with the difficulties of living in a fragile and unstable environment, and have found ways to build livelihoods and support their families despite the odds. This resilience is a key factor in the country's ability to recover from crises and build a more stable future.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Somali | 85% | Throughout the country | The Somali ethnic group is the largest in the country, and is divided into several sub-clans |\n| Bantu | 5% | Southern Somalia | The Bantu people are an ethnic minority group who were brought to Somalia as slaves from other parts of Africa |\n| Swahili | 2% | Coastal regions | The Swahili people are a coastal ethnic group who have been influenced by Arabic and Islamic cultures |\n| Arabs | 2% | Coastal regions | The Arab ethnic group is a small but significant minority in Somalia, and has had a significant impact on the country's culture and language |\n| Oromo | 1% | Western Somalia | The Oromo people are an ethnic minority group who have migrated to Somalia from neighboring Ethiopia |\n| Dir | 1% | Northern Somalia | The Dir people are a Somali sub-clan who are found primarily in the northern regions of the country |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity of Somalia is significant, with several major ethnic groups and many smaller sub-clans.
