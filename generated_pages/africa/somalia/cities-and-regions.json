The country has a federal system of government, with a central government and regional administrations. The 18 regions are grouped into several states, including Somaliland, Puntland, Jubaland, South West State, Hirshabelle, and Galmudug. Each state has its own government and a degree of autonomy, although the central government in Mogadishu is responsible for national security, foreign policy, and other key areas.\n\nThe division of Somalia into regions and states is based on a combination of historical, cultural, and geographical factors. The country has a long history of clan-based politics, and many of the regions and states are dominated by specific clans. The federal system of government is designed to accommodate these clan-based differences and provide a framework for regional autonomy and self-governance.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Mogadishu** (2.4M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Mogadishu is a bustling city with a rich history and culture, known for its vibrant markets, historic landmarks, and beautiful beaches.\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and urban life\n\n**Hargeisa** (1.3M)\nRole: capital of Somaliland, economic hub\nKnown For: Hargeisa is a thriving city with a strong sense of identity and culture, known for its vibrant markets, historic landmarks, and stunning natural beauty.\nBest For: visitors interested in culture, history, and natural beauty\n\n**Kismayo** (700,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: Kismayo is a major port city with a rich history and culture, known for its beautiful beaches, vibrant markets, and historic landmarks.\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and trade\n\n**Baidoa** (500,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Baidoa is a thriving city with a strong sense of culture and identity, known for its vibrant markets, historic landmarks, and beautiful natural beauty.\nBest For: visitors interested in culture, history, and natural beauty\n\n**Berbera** (200,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: Berbera is a major port city with a rich history and culture, known for its beautiful beaches, vibrant markets, and historic landmarks.\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and trade\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Somaliland | semi-autonomous, mountainous | historic landmarks, natural beauty | Hargeisa |\n| Puntland | semi-autonomous, coastal | beautiful beaches, vibrant markets | Garowe |\n| Jubaland | southern, coastal | historic landmarks, natural beauty | Kismayo |\n| South West State | southern, agricultural | fertile plains, vibrant markets | Baidoa |\n| Hirshabelle | central, agricultural | fertile plains, historic landmarks | Jowhar |\n| Galmudug | central, coastal | beautiful beaches, vibrant markets | Dhusamareb |\n| Mudug | central, pastoral | nomadic culture, natural beauty | Galkayo |\n| Nugaal | northern, mountainous | historic landmarks, natural beauty | Garowe |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The northern regions, such as Somaliland and Puntland, have a distinct cultural and linguistic identity, with a strong sense of autonomy and self-governance.\n- The southern regions, such as Jubaland and South West State, have a more diverse cultural and linguistic identity, with a stronger influence from neighboring countries.\n- The central regions, such as Hirshabelle and Galmudug, have a mix of cultural and linguistic identities, with a strong sense of nomadic and pastoral traditions.\n- The coastal regions, such as Kismayo and Berbera, have a distinct economic and cultural identity, with a strong focus on trade and commerce.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nSomalia has a limited transportation network, with few paved roads and limited public transportation options.
