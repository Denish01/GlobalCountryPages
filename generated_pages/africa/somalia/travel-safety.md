[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Somalia has been plagued by years of civil war, terrorism, and clan violence, making it a highly unsafe destination for tourists. The country is still recovering from the devastating effects of war and lacks a stable government, which has led to a breakdown in law and order. As a result, crime rates are high, and the risk of terrorism, kidnappings, and armed robberies is significant. Despite the efforts of the Somali government and international organizations to improve security, the country remains a high-risk destination for travelers.

The lack of infrastructure, poor healthcare, and limited access to basic services further exacerbate the safety concerns in Somalia. The country is also prone to natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and earthquakes, which can have a significant impact on the already fragile infrastructure. Additionally, the risk of health problems is high due to the lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and medical care. Therefore, it is essential for travelers to exercise extreme caution and carefully consider the risks before planning a trip to Somalia.
