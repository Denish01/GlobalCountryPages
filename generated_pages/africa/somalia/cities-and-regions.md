[SECTION] How Somalia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Somalia is divided into 18 regions, also known as gobol, which are further divided into districts. The country has a federal system of government, with a central government and regional administrations. The 18 regions are grouped into several states, including Somaliland, Puntland, Jubaland, South West State, Hirshabelle, and Galmudug. Each state has its own government and a degree of autonomy, although the central government in Mogadishu is responsible for national security, foreign policy, and other key areas.

The division of Somalia into regions and states is based on a combination of historical, cultural, and geographical factors. The country has a long history of clan-based politics, and many of the regions and states are dominated by specific clans. The federal system of government is designed to accommodate these clan-based differences and provide a framework for regional autonomy and self-governance.
