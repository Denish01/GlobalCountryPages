[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Somalia's utility infrastructure is still developing, with many areas lacking access to reliable electricity and clean water. As a result, costs can fluctuate significantly depending on the location and availability of services. In general, utility costs in Somalia are relatively high compared to other countries in the region, due in part to the country's limited infrastructure and reliance on imported fuel. The cost of utilities also varies by season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the hot summer months.

The quality of utility services in Somalia can also vary significantly depending on the provider and location. In some areas, especially in the capital city of Mogadishu, there are modern utility systems in place, while in other areas, services may be more limited. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but progress has been slow due to ongoing security concerns and lack of investment. As a result, many Somalis rely on private providers or alternative sources of energy and water, which can be more expensive and less reliable.
