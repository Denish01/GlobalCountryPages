[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Somalia has several international airports, but the main entry point is Mogadishu's Aden Adde International Airport (MGQ), which receives flights from major hubs in the Middle East and Africa, such as Dubai, Istanbul, and Nairobi. There are also international airports in Hargeisa, the capital of the self-declared state of Somaliland, and in other major cities like Bosaso and Galkayo. Direct flights to Somalia are limited, and most travelers will need to connect through a regional hub. Overland entry points exist along the borders with Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya, but traveling by land can be challenging due to security concerns and the poor condition of roads.

Travelers can also enter Somalia by sea, with several ports along the coast, including the Port of Mogadishu and the Port of Bosaso. However, this option is not commonly used by tourists, and the security situation in some parts of the country can make it difficult to travel by sea. It is essential to research and plan carefully before attempting to enter Somalia, as the security situation can change rapidly, and some areas are not safe for travelers.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights are available in Somalia, but the network is limited, and flights may be irregular or cancelled due to security concerns or weather conditions. The main domestic airlines are **Jubba Airways** and **Daallo Airlines**, which operate flights between Mogadishu and other major cities like Hargeisa, Bosaso, and Galkayo. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, as many airlines do not have online booking systems, and it may be necessary to visit a travel agency or the airline's office in person. The cost of domestic flights can vary depending on the route and the time of year, but approximate costs range from $100 to $300 for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Somalia does not have a rail network, and there are no trains or rail services available in the country. This is due to a combination of factors, including the country's limited infrastructure and the lack of investment in the transportation sector. As a result, travelers will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or domestic flights, to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses and coaches are a common mode of transportation in Somalia, particularly for intercity travel. Several bus companies operate in the country, including **Benadir Bus Company** and **Horn of Africa Bus Company**, which offer services between major cities like Mogadishu, Hargeisa, and Bosaso. The quality of buses and coaches can vary, but many are modern and well-maintained. The cost of bus travel is generally affordable, with fares ranging from $10 to $50 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and the quality of the bus.

[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| City Bus | Mogadishu, Hargeisa | $0.50-$1.00 | Limited routes and schedules |
| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10/km | Metered taxis are rare, negotiate the fare before departing |

| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Mogadishu, Hargeisa | $2-$5 | Affordable, but not always available |
