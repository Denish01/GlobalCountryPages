[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Somalia has a **territorial taxation system**, where individuals and businesses are taxed only on the income earned within the country's borders. This means that foreign-earned income is not subject to taxation in Somalia. However, individuals who are considered tax residents in Somalia may be subject to tax on their worldwide income, depending on their specific circumstances. To be considered a tax resident in Somalia, an individual must have a permanent home in the country or have been present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year.

The tax system in Somalia is still developing, and the country has been working to improve its tax laws and regulations in recent years. The **Ministry of Finance** is responsible for collecting taxes and overseeing the tax system, and the country has introduced a number of reforms aimed at increasing tax revenue and improving tax compliance. Despite these efforts, the tax system in Somalia remains relatively simple, with a limited number of tax rates and allowances.
