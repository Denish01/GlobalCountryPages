  "content": "The internet in Somalia is generally limited, with moderate speeds and coverage, but it is possible to get a SIM card and access mobile networks and WiFi in major cities like Mogadishu. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Hormuud Telecom, Somtel, Telesom\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Somalia is still in the development stage, with the country facing significant challenges in terms of infrastructure and connectivity. The average internet speed is around 5 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. The urban areas, such as Mogadishu, have better internet connectivity and speeds compared to rural areas, where the internet is often unavailable or very slow. The reliability of the internet is also a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions, especially during periods of conflict or instability.\n\nThe Somali government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with the help of international organizations and private companies. However, the progress has been slow, and the internet remains a luxury for many Somalis. The lack of access to the internet has hindered the country's economic development, as many businesses and individuals rely on the internet to access information, communicate with others, and conduct transactions. Despite these challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for many Somalis, with many using it to access news, education, and entertainment.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Somalia is relatively easy, with many mobile network operators offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers, such as Hormuud Telecom, Somtel, and Telesom, have shops and dealerships in major cities, where tourists can purchase SIM cards and register for services. To buy a SIM card, tourists will need to provide a valid passport and fill out a registration form. The cost of a SIM card is around 10 USD, and data plans start from around 5 USD per month.\n\nIt is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable dealer or shop, as there have been cases of counterfeit SIM cards being sold on the black market. Tourists should also be aware that the registration process may require additional documentation, such as a hotel reservation or a letter from a sponsor. The data plans offered by the main carriers are relatively affordable, with prices starting from around 5 USD per month for 1 GB of data.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hormuud Telecom | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Somtel | Data Plan | 2 GB | 10 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Telesom | Internet Plan | 5 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Golis Telecom | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many hotels offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not very common in Somalia, but some cafes in major cities offer free WiFi to their customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more popular in Mogadishu, with some offering high-speed internet and other amenities\n- Public WiFi is not widely available, but some restaurants and cafes offer free WiFi to their customers\n- Internet cafes are still common in Somalia, especially in rural areas where mobile network coverage is limited\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces in Mogadishu, such as the Mogadishu Coworking Space, offer high-speed internet and other amenities\n- Reliable cafe chains, such as the Village Cafe, offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots, are available for purchase from mobile network operators\n- VPNs are recommended for remote workers, as they can help to protect against **cyber threats** and ensure secure access to sensitive information\n- Some hotels, such as the Jazeera Palace Hotel, offer high-speed internet and other amenities for remote workers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Somalia, with some websites and social media platforms being blocked by the government\n- **Blocked sites** include some news websites and social media platforms, which can be accessed using **VPNs**\n- VPNs are recommended for all internet users in Somalia, as they can help to protect against **cyber threats** and ensure secure access to sensitive information\n- Roaming alternatives, such as purchasing a local SIM card, are recommended for tourists, as they can be more cost-effective than roaming with a foreign SIM card\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Somalia, but some mobile network operators offer eSIM plans for tourists\n- It is recommended to use **secure connections** and **strong passwords** when accessing the internet in Somalia, as **cybercrime** is a growing concern in the country",
