[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Somalia is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a GDP per capita of $1,602. The cost of living in Somalia is relatively low compared to other countries in Africa. However, the country's economy is largely informal, and the cost of living can vary greatly depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal choices. The budget of $300-400 per month can provide a basic standard of living, while $600-800 per month can offer a more comfortable lifestyle. In comparison to neighboring countries, Somalia is generally cheaper than Djibouti and Kenya, but more expensive than Ethiopia.

The affordability of Somalia depends on the individual's lifestyle and expectations. For those who are willing to live a simple life and adapt to the local culture, Somalia can be a relatively affordable country. However, for those who require a higher standard of living and modern amenities, Somalia may be more challenging. The country's lack of infrastructure, limited access to healthcare and education, and high level of insecurity can make it difficult for foreigners to live and work in Somalia.

[SECTION] Is Somalia Affordable? [/SECTION]
Somalia can be an affordable destination for digital nomads, retirees, and students who are willing to live a simple life and adapt to the local culture. The country's low cost of living, rich culture, and beautiful landscapes make it an attractive option for those who are looking for a unique and affordable experience. However, Somalia may not be suitable for families with young children, as the country's lack of infrastructure, limited access to healthcare and education, and high level of insecurity can make it challenging to raise a family.

For foreigners who require a higher standard of living and modern amenities, Somalia may be more expensive than expected. The country's limited access to high-quality healthcare, education, and other services can make it necessary to seek these services in neighboring countries, which can increase the cost of living. Additionally, the country's security situation can make it necessary to take extra precautions, such as hiring security guards or using armored vehicles, which can also increase the cost of living. Overall, Somalia is a country that requires careful planning, flexibility, and a willingness to adapt to the local culture and way of life.
