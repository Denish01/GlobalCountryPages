[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Somalia are generally lower compared to the regional average, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant costing around $3-$5 USD. However, the cost of food can fluctuate depending on various factors such as the season, conflict, and economic conditions. Somalia has a vibrant eating-out culture, with many restaurants and street food stalls serving traditional dishes like **sabaayad** (flatbread) and **hilib ari** (goat meat). However, home cooking is also a significant part of Somali cuisine, with many families preparing meals at home using fresh ingredients from local markets.

The prices of food in Somalia are driven by various factors, including the cost of transportation, conflict, and economic conditions. The country's economy is largely dependent on imports, which can lead to fluctuations in food prices. Additionally, the lack of infrastructure and transportation networks can make it difficult to access certain areas, leading to higher prices in some regions. Despite these challenges, Somalia has a rich culinary tradition, with a focus on fresh ingredients, spices, and traditional cooking methods.
