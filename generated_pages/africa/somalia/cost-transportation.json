  "content": "The cost of transportation in Somalia varies widely depending on the mode of transport, with a monthly transit pass costing around $10-$20 USD, while a taxi start rate is approximately $2-$5 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($10-$20 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($2-$5 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($0.80-$1.20 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (No — limited availability, some local apps)\nCurrency: SOS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nSomalia has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **minibuses**, **taxis**, and **private vehicles** to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with limited coverage and frequent delays. However, the country's **port cities**, such as Mogadishu and Kismayo, have a more developed transportation network, with a greater variety of options available. In these cities, **buses** and **minibuses** are the primary mode of public transportation, while **taxis** are also widely available.\n\nIn rural areas, **donkey carts** and **camel rides** are still common modes of transportation, particularly for short distances. The lack of a well-developed transportation infrastructure makes it challenging to travel long distances, and **road conditions** can be poor, especially during the rainy season. Despite these challenges, the Somali government has been working to improve the transportation network, with plans to **rebuild roads** and **expand public transportation** in the coming years.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage, frequent delays |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Frequent, but often overcrowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2-$5 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Limited availability, often negotiate fare |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited availability, some local apps |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, often negotiate fare |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80-$1.20 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70-$1.10 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, prices vary depending on location |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $0.50-$1.00 | Limited parking options, often informal |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, limited road network |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited availability, often delayed |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited availability, often expensive |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which are often cheaper than **private taxis**.\n- When using **taxis**, it's essential to **negotiate the fare** beforehand, as meters are not always available.\n- For long-distance travel, **booking in advance** can help secure a seat on **buses** or **flights**, which can be limited.\n- **Road safety** is a concern in Somalia, particularly at night, so it's recommended to **travel with a reputable company** or **use a trusted driver**.\n- **Local knowledge** is essential when navigating Somalia's transportation network, so consider **hiring a guide** or **using a local app** to help you get around.\n- **Be prepared for delays** and **flexible schedules**, as the transportation network in Somalia can be unpredictable.",
