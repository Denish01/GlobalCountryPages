As a result, costs can fluctuate significantly depending on the location and availability of services. In general, utility costs in Somalia are relatively high compared to other countries in the region, due in part to the country's limited infrastructure and reliance on imported fuel. The cost of utilities also varies by season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the hot summer months.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Somalia can also vary significantly depending on the provider and location. In some areas, especially in the capital city of Mogadishu, there are modern utility systems in place, while in other areas, services may be more limited. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but progress has been slow due to ongoing security concerns and lack of investment. As a result, many Somalis rely on private providers or alternative sources of energy and water, which can be more expensive and less reliable.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 10-20 Mbps | Hormuud Telecom, Somtel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 50-100 Mbps | Hormuud Telecom, Somtel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Hormuud Telecom, Somtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Hormuud Telecom, Somtel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Hormuud Telecom, Somtel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Somalia, it is often necessary to work with private providers, as the public utility infrastructure is limited.\n- Prepaid electricity is a common option in Somalia, as it allows users to control their costs and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Somalia are Hormuud Telecom and Somtel, which offer a range of plans and services.\n- To save on utility bills, it is a good idea to use energy-efficient appliances and to conserve water and electricity whenever possible.\n- It is also a good idea to research and compare prices among different providers to find the best deals on utilities and internet services.",
