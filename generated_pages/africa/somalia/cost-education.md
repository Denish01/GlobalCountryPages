[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Somalia is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. However, due to the country's tumultuous past, the public education system has faced significant challenges, including a lack of funding, infrastructure, and qualified teachers. As a result, the quality of education in public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and sanitation facilities. In contrast, private schools in Somalia tend to offer higher-quality education, with better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum. The language of instruction in Somali schools is primarily Somali and Arabic, although some private schools may offer English-language instruction.

The compulsory education years in Somalia are from age 6 to 14, with students typically attending primary school for 4 years and secondary school for 4 years. However, due to the country's fragile education system, many students do not complete their compulsory education, and some may attend school irregularly or not at all. International schools are available in major cities such as Mogadishu, but they are relatively rare and tend to cater to the children of expatriates and wealthy Somalis. These schools often offer a curriculum based on international standards, such as the International Baccalaureate or the British GCSE.
