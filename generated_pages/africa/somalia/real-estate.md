[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Somalia is still in its early stages of development, with a lack of infrastructure and limited access to financing options. The country has been affected by years of conflict and instability, which has hindered the growth of the real estate sector. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in investment in the property market, particularly in the capital city of Mogadishu. The market is largely driven by demand for residential and commercial properties, with a growing middle class and an increasing number of international organizations and businesses operating in the country. The price trajectory of the property market in Somalia is upward, with prices increasing by around 10% per annum in recent years.

The urban areas, such as Mogadishu and Hargeisa, are experiencing faster growth in the property market compared to rural areas. The demand for properties in these areas is driven by the growing population and the increasing number of businesses and organizations operating in the country. The property market in Somalia is also characterized by a lack of transparency and a limited number of qualified real estate agents, which can make it challenging for buyers and investors to navigate the market.

The Somali government has introduced several initiatives to develop the property market, including the establishment of a land registry and the introduction of new laws and regulations to govern the sector. These initiatives are expected to improve the transparency and efficiency of the property market, making it more attractive to investors and buyers.
