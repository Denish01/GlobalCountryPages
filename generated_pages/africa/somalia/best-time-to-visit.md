# Best Time to Visit Somalia — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Somalia is from December to February, when the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for travel and outdoor activities.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Somalia: December to February. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: March to May. Avoid: September to November and March to May due to the hot and humid weather, and the risk of **Gu** (spring) and **Dayr** (autumn) rains. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Somalia has a tropical **desert climate** with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by hot temperatures and low humidity, while the wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the northern region, which is generally cooler and drier; the central region, which is hotter and more humid; and the southern region, which is characterized by a mix of both. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Somalia, with the dry season being the best time to visit the northern and central regions, and the wet season being the best time to visit the southern region.

The dry season is the best time to visit Somalia's **beaches** and **national parks**, as the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as **hiking** and **wildlife watching**. However, the dry season is also the peak tourist season, which means that prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher. On the other hand, the wet season is the best time to visit Somalia's **agricultural regions**, as the rainfall makes the landscape green and lush, and the temperatures are generally milder.

Somalia's climate is also affected by its geography, with the **Ogaden plateau** in the west and the **Migiurtinia highlands** in the north being cooler and more temperate than the rest of the country. The coastal regions, on the other hand, are generally hotter and more humid, with high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year.
