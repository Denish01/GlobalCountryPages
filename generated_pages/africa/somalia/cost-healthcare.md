[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Somalia has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available, but the quality of care can vary significantly between the two. Public healthcare facilities are generally underfunded and understaffed, and may not have access to the latest medical technology or equipment. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, are generally better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive and may not be accessible to the general population. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it may opt for private healthcare. Insurance is highly recommended for foreigners and those who can afford it, as it can help cover the cost of medical care and provide access to better-equipped facilities.

The healthcare system in Somalia is also heavily reliant on foreign aid and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which can provide additional resources and support to public healthcare facilities. However, the system is still struggling to recover from years of conflict and instability, and there are significant challenges to accessing healthcare, particularly in rural areas. For example, many public healthcare facilities may not have access to basic medical supplies, such as antibiotics or painkillers, and may not have the necessary equipment or staff to provide emergency care.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, may be available at public pharmacies for $5-10
- Prescription medications may require a doctor's note and may be more expensive, ranging from $10-50
- Pharmacy availability may be limited in rural areas, and medication shortages are common
- Over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, may be available at local markets and shops for $1-5
- Some pharmacies may not have the necessary licenses or permits, and may sell counterfeit or expired medications
- It is recommended to only purchase medications from licensed pharmacies and to check the expiration dates and packaging carefully

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 999, the local emergency number, or to seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital or clinic. However, ambulance availability may be limited, and emergency care may not be readily available in rural areas. For foreigners and those who can afford it, it is recommended to seek care at private hospitals, which may have more experienced staff and better-equipped facilities. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Somalia include the **Eurosurgical Hospital** in Mogadishu, which has a 24-hour emergency room and a range of specialist services, and the **Madina Hospital** in Mogadishu, which has a reputation for providing high-quality medical care.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency evacuations or repatriations, as medical care in Somalia may not be sufficient to treat more serious conditions. This may involve purchasing international health insurance or having a contingency plan in place for emergency evacuations. Additionally, it is recommended to take precautions to stay healthy while in Somalia, such as taking malaria prophylaxis and avoiding untreated water and food. By taking these precautions and having a plan in place, foreigners and locals alike can help ensure that they receive the medical care they need in the event of an emergency.
