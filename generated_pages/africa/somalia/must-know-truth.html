        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Somalia, located in the Horn of Africa, has a rich and complex history that spans over 2,000 years. The territory was inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the <strong>Somali people</strong>, who are the predominant ethnic group in the country. The country's strategic location on the Indian Ocean made it an important trading center, with merchants from ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome visiting its ports. In the 19th century, Somalia was colonized by European powers, including Italy, Britain, and France. The country gained independence from Italy on July 1, 1960, and became a sovereign state.</p>
        <p>The early years of independence were marked by a period of stability and growth, with the country adopting a <strong>socialist</strong> economic system and aligning itself with the Soviet Union. However, the country's stability was short-lived, and a military coup in 1969 led by <strong>Siad Barre</strong> marked the beginning of a long period of authoritarian rule. Barre's regime was marked by human rights abuses, repression of opposition, and a devastating civil war that lasted from 1988 to 1991. The civil war led to the collapse of the Barre regime and the fragmentation of the country into various factions and territories.</p>
        <p>In 1991, the country descended into chaos, with various factions and warlords vying for power. The United Nations intervened in 1992, but the <strong>UNOSOM</strong> mission was unable to restore stability and was withdrawn in 1995. The country has since been governed by a series of transitional governments, with the current <strong>Federal Government of Somalia</strong> established in 2012. Despite ongoing challenges, Somalia has made significant progress in recent years, with the country holding its first democratic elections in 2017.</p>
        <p>The country's history has been marked by periods of conflict, instability, and foreign intervention, which have had a profound impact on its development and stability. Understanding Somalia's complex history is essential to grasping the country's current challenges and opportunities. The country's strategic location, natural resources, and cultural heritage make it an important player in regional and global affairs.</p>
