[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Somalia has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **minibuses**, **taxis**, and **private vehicles** to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with limited coverage and frequent delays. However, the country's **port cities**, such as Mogadishu and Kismayo, have a more developed transportation network, with a greater variety of options available. In these cities, **buses** and **minibuses** are the primary mode of public transportation, while **taxis** are also widely available.

In rural areas, **donkey carts** and **camel rides** are still common modes of transportation, particularly for short distances. The lack of a well-developed transportation infrastructure makes it challenging to travel long distances, and **road conditions** can be poor, especially during the rainy season. Despite these challenges, the Somali government has been working to improve the transportation network, with plans to **rebuild roads** and **expand public transportation** in the coming years.
