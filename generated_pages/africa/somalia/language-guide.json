Somali is a member of the Afro-Asiatic language family and is closely related to other languages spoken in the Horn of Africa, such as Oromo and Amharic. There are several regional dialects of Somali, including **Maxaa**, **Baraawe**, and **Benaadir**, which are spoken in different parts of the country. Arabic is also widely spoken, particularly in urban areas and among the educated population. English is not as widely spoken, but it is becoming more popular, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. Italian is also spoken by some Somalis, particularly those who have had contact with Italian colonizers in the past.\n\nThe use of English in Somalia is limited, and it is not commonly spoken outside of major cities like **Mogadishu**. However, many Somalis are eager to learn English, and it is becoming more widely taught in schools. In addition to Somali and Arabic, there are also several minority languages spoken in Somalia, including **Maay** and **Tunni**, which are spoken by smaller ethnic groups.\n\nSomali is a complex language with a unique grammar and syntax. It is a tonal language, which means that the pitch and intonation of words can change their meaning. Somali is also a language with a rich literary tradition, and it has a strong oral culture. Many Somalis are skilled poets and storytellers, and the language is often used to express complex emotions and ideas.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Salaam | sah-LAHM | formal |\n| Hello | Marhaba | mar-HAH-bah | informal |\n| Thank you | Mahadsanid | mah-HAD-sah-nid | formal |\n| Thank you | Shukriya | SHOO-kree-yah | informal |\n| Please | Fadlan | fahd-LAHN | formal |\n| Please | Luqad | loo-GAH-d | informal |\n| Yes / No | Haa / Maya | hah / MAY-ah | formal |\n| Yes / No | Ee / Maya | ay / MAY-ah | informal |\n| Excuse me | Afsoo | ahf-SOH | formal |\n| How much? | Inta leydhay? | in-TAH layd-HAY | formal |\n| Where is...? | Xaruntiisu...? | khar-oo-TEE-soo | formal |\n| I don't understand | Ma fahamayo | mah fah-HAH-mah-yoh | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Ma ku hadasha Ingiriisi? | mah koo hah-DAH-shah in-GEE-ree-see | formal |\n| Help! | Caawin | CHOW-in | formal |\n| Goodbye | Nabad gelyo | NAH-bahd GEH-lyoh | formal |\n| Sorry | Afsoo | ahf-SOH | formal |\n| My name is... | Magacay waa... | mah-GAH-chay wah | formal |\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Kow | koh |\n| 2 | Laba | LAH-bah |\n| 3 | Saddex | SAH-dehkh |\n| 4 | Afar | AH-far |\n| 5 | Shan | SHAHN |\n| 6 | Lix | LEHKH |\n| 7 | Toddoba | toh-DOH-bah |\n| 8 | Siddeed | SEE-deh-ed |\n| 9 | Sagaashan | SAH-gah-shahn |\n| 10 | Toban | TOH-bahn |\n| 100 | Boqol | BOH-kohl |\n| 1000 | Kun | KUHN |\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with Somalis, it is customary to use your right hand when giving or receiving something, as the left hand is considered unclean.\n- Direct eye contact is important in Somali culture, as it is seen as a sign of respect and honesty.\n- Somalis place a strong emphasis on hospitality, so be prepared to be offered food and drink when visiting someone's home.\n- When communicating with Somalis, it is best to be direct and clear, as they value straightforwardness and honesty.\n- Avoid using gestures or body language that may be considered aggressive or confrontational, such as pointing or standing with your hands on your hips.\n- When bargaining, it is customary to start with a low offer and work your way up, as Somalis enjoy the process of negotiation.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Somali, such as \"Hello\" and \"Thank you\", as this will show respect for the culture and people.\n- Be patient and flexible when communicating with Somalis, as they may have different customs and expectations than what you are used to.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- **Google Translate** is a useful app for translating Somali and Arabic phrases.\n- **iTranslate** is another popular translation app that includes Somali and Arabic languages.\n- **Somali Dictionary** is a comprehensive online dictionary that includes definitions and pronunciation guides for Somali words.\n- **Language learning podcasts**, such as \"Somali Podcast\", can be a great way to learn basic phrases and improve your listening skills.\n- **Language exchange websites**, such as italki, can connect you with native Somali speakers who can help you practice your language skills and provide feedback on your pronunciation.",
