  "content": "The infrastructure in Somalia is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, with limited access to electricity, water, and transportation, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 33% of population\nInternet Penetration: 12%\nRoad Network: 22,000 km, poor condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 7\nMajor Ports: 4\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSomalia's infrastructure has been severely affected by decades of civil war, which has hindered the country's development and reconstruction efforts. Recent investments have focused on rebuilding and expanding critical infrastructure, including roads, ports, and energy facilities. However, the urban-rural gap remains significant, with cities like Mogadishu and Hargeisa having relatively better access to basic services compared to rural areas. The **Somali government** has launched initiatives to improve the overall infrastructure development level, but progress is slow due to funding constraints and security concerns.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure development has severe implications for the economy and the population. Limited access to electricity, water, and transportation hinders economic growth, increases poverty, and exacerbates social inequalities. Furthermore, the poor condition of roads and the absence of a rail network make it difficult to transport goods and people, which further isolates rural communities. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for growth and development, particularly in the areas of renewable energy and telecommunications.\n\nInternational organizations and donors have been working with the Somali government to support infrastructure development, including the **World Bank** and the **African Development Bank**. These efforts aim to improve the overall infrastructure development level and address the urban-rural gap. However, more needs to be done to ensure sustainable and equitable development, including increasing funding, improving governance, and enhancing the participation of local communities in decision-making processes.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 22,000 km | Poor | Limited maintenance, frequent closures due to conflict or natural disasters |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network exists in Somalia |\n| Airports | 7 international, 5 domestic | Moderate | Limited facilities, security concerns at some airports |\n| Ports | 4 major | Good | Ports in Mogadishu, Kismayo, Berbera, and Bosaso handle most of the country's trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Somalia relies heavily on **fossil fuels** for power generation, with most electricity coming from diesel-powered generators.\n- The country has significant potential for **renewable energy**, particularly solar and wind power, but development has been slow due to lack of investment and infrastructure.\n- Electricity outages are frequent, especially in rural areas, where many households rely on traditional energy sources like charcoal and firewood.\n- The Somali government has launched initiatives to increase access to electricity, including the development of **mini-grids** and **off-grid solar systems**.\n- International organizations are supporting efforts to improve energy access and promote renewable energy development in Somalia.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to safe drinking water is a significant challenge in Somalia, with many households relying on **unimproved water sources** like wells and rivers.\n- Sanitation coverage is also limited, with many communities lacking access to **basic latrines** and other sanitation facilities.\n- Water-borne diseases like cholera and diarrhea are prevalent, particularly in rural areas where **hygiene practices** are poor.\n- The Somali government and international organizations are working to improve water and sanitation services, including the development of **community-based water systems** and **latrine construction** programs.\n- **Water conservation** efforts are also being promoted, particularly in areas where water scarcity is a significant concern.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile phone coverage is relatively good in Somalia, with several **mobile network operators** providing services across the country.\n- **Internet penetration** is low, but growing, with many Somalis using mobile devices to access the internet.\n- **Fiber-optic cables** are being laid to improve internet connectivity, particularly in urban areas.\n- The Somali government has launched initiatives to promote **e-government services** and **digital literacy** programs.\n- **Postal services** are limited, with many Somalis relying on private courier companies to send and receive mail.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Somali National Development Plan** outlines priorities for infrastructure development, including the expansion of roads, ports, and energy facilities.\n- The **World Bank** is supporting the development of **mini-grids** and **off-grid solar systems** to increase access to electricity in rural areas.\n- The **African Development Bank** is funding the construction of **new roads** and the rehabilitation of existing ones to improve transportation links.\n- The **European Union** is supporting the development of **water and sanitation infrastructure**, including the construction of **water treatment plants** and **latrines**.\n- The **United Nations** is promoting **disaster risk reduction** and **climate change adaptation** efforts, including the development of **early warning systems** and **climate-resilient infrastructure**.",
