The country is still recovering from the devastating effects of war and lacks a stable government, which has led to a breakdown in law and order. As a result, crime rates are high, and the risk of terrorism, kidnappings, and armed robberies is significant. Despite the efforts of the Somali government and international organizations to improve security, the country remains a high-risk destination for travelers.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure, poor healthcare, and limited access to basic services further exacerbate the safety concerns in Somalia. The country is also prone to natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and earthquakes, which can have a significant impact on the already fragile infrastructure. Additionally, the risk of health problems is high due to the lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and medical care. Therefore, it is essential for travelers to exercise extreme caution and carefully consider the risks before planning a trip to Somalia.\n\n[SECTION] Safety By Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/Region | Safety Level | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mogadishu | High Risk | Avoid non-essential travel due to high risk of terrorism and crime |\n| Hargeisa | Moderate Risk | Safer than Mogadishu, but still risky due to clan violence and crime |\n| Kismayo | High Risk | Port city with high risk of piracy and crime |\n| Baidoa | High Risk | City affected by clan violence and terrorism |\n| Puntland | Moderate Risk | Semi-autonomous region with lower risk of crime and terrorism |\n| Somaliland | Moderate Risk | Self-declared state with lower risk of crime and terrorism |\n| Galguduud | High Risk | Region affected by clan violence and terrorism |\n| Lower Shabelle | High Risk | Region affected by clan violence and terrorism |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Common Risks & Scams [/SECTION]\n- **Kidnappings**: High risk of kidnappings, especially in Mogadishu and other high-risk areas\n- **Armed Robberies**: High risk of armed robberies, especially at night\n- **Terrorism**: High risk of terrorist attacks, especially in public places\n- **Piracy**: High risk of piracy, especially in coastal areas\n- **Scams**: High risk of scams, especially in markets and other crowded areas\n- **Clan Violence**: High risk of clan violence, especially in rural areas\n- **Road Accidents**: High risk of road accidents due to poor road conditions and reckless driving\n- **Health Scams**: Risk of health scams, especially in areas with limited access to medical care\n\n[SECTION] Health & Medical [/SECTION]\n- **Vaccinations**: Recommended vaccinations include **Hepatitis A**, **Hepatitis B**, **Typhoid**, and **Rabies**\n- **Water Safety**: Tap water is not safe to drink, and bottled water is recommended\n- **Medical Facilities**: Medical facilities are limited, and emergency medical care is often unavailable\n- **Pharmacy Access**: Pharmacy access is limited, and prescription medications may not be available\n\n[SECTION] Practical Safety Tips [/SECTION]\n- Avoid traveling at night due to high risk of crime and terrorism\n- Use reputable and licensed transportation services\n- Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and use secure methods of payment\n- Stay informed about local conditions and security threats\n- Avoid displaying signs of wealth, such as expensive jewelry or watches\n- Stay in touch with family and friends back home and keep them informed of your itinerary\n- Avoid traveling alone, especially in high-risk areas\n- Use secure and reputable accommodations\n\n[SECTION] For Solo & Women Travelers [/SECTION]\n- Avoid traveling alone, especially at night, due to high risk of crime and harassment\n- Dress modestly and respect local customs and traditions\n- Avoid displaying signs of wealth, such as expensive jewelry or watches\n- Stay in touch with family and friends back home and keep them informed of your itinerary\n- Use reputable and licensed transportation services, and avoid hitchhiking or accepting rides from strangers",
