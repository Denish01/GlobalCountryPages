  "content": "The best time to visit Somalia is from December to February, when the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for travel and outdoor activities.\n\n[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Somalia: December to February. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: March to May. Avoid: September to November and March to May due to the hot and humid weather, and the risk of **Gu** (spring) and **Dayr** (autumn) rains. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nSomalia has a tropical **desert climate** with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by hot temperatures and low humidity, while the wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the northern region, which is generally cooler and drier; the central region, which is hotter and more humid; and the southern region, which is characterized by a mix of both. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Somalia, with the dry season being the best time to visit the northern and central regions, and the wet season being the best time to visit the southern region.\n\nThe dry season is the best time to visit Somalia's **beaches** and **national parks**, as the weather is cooler and drier, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as **hiking** and **wildlife watching**. However, the dry season is also the peak tourist season, which means that prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher. On the other hand, the wet season is the best time to visit Somalia's **agricultural regions**, as the rainfall makes the landscape green and lush, and the temperatures are generally milder.\n\nSomalia's climate is also affected by its geography, with the **Ogaden plateau** in the west and the **Migiurtinia highlands** in the north being cooler and more temperate than the rest of the country. The coastal regions, on the other hand, are generally hotter and more humid, with high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Hot and dry | Low | $ | Beaches, national parks |\n| February | Hot and dry | Low | $ | Beaches, national parks |\n| March | Hot and humid | Med | $$ | Agricultural regions |\n| April | Hot and humid | Med | $$ | Agricultural regions |\n| May | Hot and humid | Med | $$ | Agricultural regions |\n| June | Hot and rainy | High | $$$ | Festivals and events |\n| July | Hot and rainy | High | $$$ | Festivals and events |\n| August | Hot and rainy | High | $$$ | Festivals and events |\n| September | Hot and rainy | Med | $$ | Agricultural regions |\n| October | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | Beaches, national parks |\n| November | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | Beaches, national parks |\n| December | Cool and dry | Low | $ | Beaches, national parks |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Eid al-Fitr** | June | A Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan |\n| **Eid al-Adha** | September | A Muslim holiday that commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son |\n| **Independence Day** | July | A national holiday that celebrates Somalia's independence from Italy |\n| **Mogadishu International Book Fair** | August | A literary festival that showcases Somali and international literature |\n| **Hargeisa International Book Fair** | July | A literary festival that showcases Somali and international literature |\n| **Borama Cultural Festival** | September | A cultural festival that showcases Somali music, dance, and art |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The northern region of Somalia, which includes the **Self-Declared Republic of Somaliland**, has a cooler and drier climate than the rest of the country, making it ideal for travel during the dry season.\n- The central region of Somalia, which includes the capital city **Mogadishu**, is hotter and more humid than the northern region, making it best to visit during the wet season.\n- The southern region of Somalia, which includes the **Jubaland** and **Gedo** regions, has a mix of both hot and humid weather, making it best to visit during the wet season.\n- The **Ogaden plateau** in the west is cooler and more temperate than the rest of the country, making it ideal for travel during the dry season.\n- The **Migiurtinia highlands** in the north are cooler and more temperate than the rest of the country, making it ideal for travel during the dry season.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tourist services well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting Somalia during the shoulder season, which runs from September to November and March to May, to avoid the crowds and high prices of the peak season.\n- Pack lightweight and breathable clothing, as well as sun protection, to protect yourself from the hot and sunny weather.\n- Be aware of the **Ramadan** month, which can affect the availability of food and drink during the day, and plan your itinerary accordingly.\n- Avoid traveling to Somalia during the **Gu** (spring) and **Dayr** (autumn) rains, which can make roads impassable and increase the risk of **flooding** and **landslides**.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or joining a guided tour to help you navigate the country and stay safe, especially during the wet season.",
