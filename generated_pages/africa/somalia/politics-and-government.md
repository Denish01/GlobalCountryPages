[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Somalia is based on a federal system, with power divided between the federal government and the regional states. The federal government is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, national security, and fiscal policy, while the regional states have significant autonomy to manage their own affairs. The system of government is designed to promote **decentralization** and **power-sharing**, with the aim of reducing conflict and promoting stability. However, the system is still in its early stages of development, and there are many challenges to be addressed. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government each having distinct roles and responsibilities.

The Somali government has made significant progress in recent years in establishing a functional system of government, with the adoption of a new constitution in 2012 and the establishment of a federal parliament. However, the country still faces many challenges, including **terrorism**, **corruption**, and **poverty**. The government has also made efforts to promote **reconciliation** and **nation-building**, with the aim of promoting unity and stability. Despite these challenges, Somalia has made significant progress in recent years, with the government and international partners working together to promote **peace** and **stability**.

The Somali government has also made efforts to promote **democratization** and **good governance**, with the aim of promoting accountability and transparency. The government has established a number of institutions, including the **Anti-Corruption Commission** and the **National Human Rights Commission**, to promote **good governance** and **human rights**. However, much work remains to be done to address the many challenges facing the country.
