[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Somalia's housing market is largely informal, with a significant portion of the population living in makeshift or temporary accommodations. The rental market in urban areas such as Mogadishu is relatively competitive, with a range of options available, from basic rooms to larger apartments and houses. Typical lease terms are short, ranging from 6 to 12 months, and often require a deposit of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes over rent and eviction are common. Compared to regional neighbors, Somalia's housing costs are relatively low, but the lack of infrastructure and services can make living conditions challenging.

The housing market in Somalia is also influenced by the country's history of conflict and displacement, with many people living in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) or in informal settlements. The government has initiated efforts to improve the housing sector, including the development of new housing projects and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant housing needs of the population. Somalia's housing costs are generally lower than those in neighboring countries such as Djibouti and Kenya, but higher than those in Ethiopia.
