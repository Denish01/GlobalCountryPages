# Tanzania Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Tanzania's infrastructure is developing, with significant investments in recent years, but still faces challenges in providing reliable and widespread access to basic services such as electricity, water, and transportation.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 32.8% of population
Internet Penetration: 22%
Road Network: 87,581 km, with 12,757 km paved
Rail Network: 2,707 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Tanzania's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. However, the government has been investing heavily in recent years to improve the situation. The country has a significant urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with cities like Dar es Salaam and Dodoma having better access to basic services than rural areas. The government has launched several initiatives to address this gap, including the development of rural roads and the expansion of electricity and water services to rural areas.

Despite these efforts, Tanzania still faces significant challenges in providing reliable and efficient infrastructure services. The country's infrastructure is often characterized by inadequate capacity, poor maintenance, and inefficient management. For example, the road network is often congested and in disrepair, while the rail network is underutilized and in need of modernization. The energy sector is also facing challenges, with frequent power outages and a reliance on imported fuel.

The government has recognized the need to improve the country's infrastructure and has launched several initiatives to attract investment and improve the business environment. These initiatives include the development of public-private partnerships, the creation of special economic zones, and the simplification of regulatory procedures. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gap that exists in Tanzania.
