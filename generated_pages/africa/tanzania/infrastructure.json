  "content": "Tanzania's infrastructure is developing, with significant investments in recent years, but still faces challenges in providing reliable and widespread access to basic services such as electricity, water, and transportation.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 32.8% of population\nInternet Penetration: 22%\nRoad Network: 87,581 km, with 12,757 km paved\nRail Network: 2,707 km\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nTanzania's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. However, the government has been investing heavily in recent years to improve the situation. The country has a significant urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with cities like Dar es Salaam and Dodoma having better access to basic services than rural areas. The government has launched several initiatives to address this gap, including the development of rural roads and the expansion of electricity and water services to rural areas.\n\nDespite these efforts, Tanzania still faces significant challenges in providing reliable and efficient infrastructure services. The country's infrastructure is often characterized by inadequate capacity, poor maintenance, and inefficient management. For example, the road network is often congested and in disrepair, while the rail network is underutilized and in need of modernization. The energy sector is also facing challenges, with frequent power outages and a reliance on imported fuel.\n\nThe government has recognized the need to improve the country's infrastructure and has launched several initiatives to attract investment and improve the business environment. These initiatives include the development of public-private partnerships, the creation of special economic zones, and the simplification of regulatory procedures. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gap that exists in Tanzania.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 87,581 km | Moderate | 12,757 km paved, 74,824 km unpaved |\n| Railways | 2,707 km | Poor | Underutilized and in need of modernization |\n| Airports | 4 international, 13 domestic | Good | Major airports include Julius Nyerere International Airport and Kilimanjaro International Airport |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Port of Dar es Salaam and Port of Tanga are the main ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Tanzania's power generation is primarily based on **thermal power**, with a small contribution from **hydroelectric power**.\n- The country faces frequent **power outages**, particularly during periods of high demand.\n- The government has launched initiatives to increase the use of **renewable energy**, including solar and wind power.\n- The **Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO)** is the main electricity utility company in the country.\n- The government has plans to increase the country's power generation capacity, including the development of new **gas-fired power plants**.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in Tanzania, with many people relying on alternative sources of water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively low, particularly in rural areas.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water access** in rural areas, including the development of new water supply systems.\n- **Wastewater management** is also a challenge, with many cities lacking adequate wastewater treatment facilities.\n- The government has plans to increase investment in the water sector, including the development of new **water treatment plants**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread in Tanzania, with many people using mobile phones to access basic services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in some areas, particularly in major cities.\n- The government has launched initiatives to increase **4G/5G rollout**, including the development of new mobile networks.\n- **Postal services** are available, but are not widely used.\n- The government has plans to increase investment in the telecommunications sector, including the development of new **telecommunications infrastructure**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major **transport infrastructure development project**, including the construction of new roads and railways.\n- The **Tanzania Ports Authority** is investing in the development of new port facilities, including the expansion of the Port of Dar es Salaam.\n- The government has plans to increase investment in the **energy sector**, including the development of new power generation projects.\n- The **World Bank** is providing funding for several infrastructure development projects in Tanzania, including the development of new water supply systems.\n- The government has launched a major **urban development project**, including the development of new housing and infrastructure in major cities.",
