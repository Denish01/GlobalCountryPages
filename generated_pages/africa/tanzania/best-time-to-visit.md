# Best Time to Visit Tanzania — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Tanzania is during the dry season, from June to October, when the weather is warm and sunny, and the wildlife viewing is optimal. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Tanzania: June to October. Peak season: July to September. Budget season: April to May and November. Avoid: March to May due to heavy rainfall and November to December for the short rains. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Tanzania has a varied climate, with different regions experiencing different weather patterns. The country can be broadly divided into four climate zones: the **coastal lowlands**, the **highlands**, the **northern safari circuit**, and the **southern safari circuit**. The dry season, which runs from June to October, is the best time to visit Tanzania, as the weather is warm and sunny, and the wildlife viewing is optimal. The wet season, which runs from November to May, is characterized by heavy rainfall, and some areas can be inaccessible due to flooding. The **short rains**, which occur from November to December, and the **long rains**, which occur from March to May, are the two main rainy seasons in Tanzania.

The dry season is the peak tourist season, and prices for accommodations and tours are at their highest. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, and prices are significantly lower. However, some tourist attractions and national parks may be closed due to flooding, and the roads can be in poor condition. The **shoulder season**, which runs from April to May and November, is a good time to visit Tanzania if you're looking for a more affordable option and don't mind the occasional rain shower.

The seasons in Tanzania also affect the **wildlife migration patterns**. The Great Migration, which is one of the most spectacular wildlife events in the world, occurs from July to September, when millions of wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles migrate from the Serengeti to the Maasai Mara in search of greener pastures. This is the best time to visit the **Serengeti National Park** and the **Ngorongoro Conservation Area**, as the wildlife viewing is optimal.
