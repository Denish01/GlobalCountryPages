Tanzania's population is the second-largest in East Africa, and its size and growth rate have significant implications for the country's economy, infrastructure, and social services. The population has been growing at a rate of approximately 2.7% per year, which is higher than the global average. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and declining mortality rates. The urban population is growing rapidly, with an estimated 34% of the population living in urban areas, and this trend is expected to continue as people move to cities in search of better economic opportunities.

However, this urbanization trend also poses challenges, including the strain on urban infrastructure and services.

Tanzania's population growth has also been influenced by migration patterns, with many people moving to the country from neighboring countries in search of work or fleeing conflict.
