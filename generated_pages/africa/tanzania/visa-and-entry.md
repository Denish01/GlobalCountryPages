[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Tanzania has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of around 40 countries eligible for visa-free access, including those from neighboring countries and certain African nations. The country issues various types of visas, including tourist, business, and student visas, to cater to different visitor needs. Visitors from countries that are not eligible for visa-free access can obtain a visa on arrival or apply for an eVisa in advance.

Tanzania's visa policy aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel while maintaining national security and immigration control. The country has introduced an online visa application system to streamline the process and reduce waiting times at ports of entry. Visitors can apply for an eVisa through the official Tanzania Immigration website, which typically takes 2-3 working days to process.
