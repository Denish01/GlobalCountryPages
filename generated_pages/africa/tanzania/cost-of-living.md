[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]
- Consider staying in budget-friendly accommodations, such as hostels or guesthouses, which can be significantly cheaper than mid-range or luxury hotels.
- Eat at local markets or street food stalls, which offer a wide range of delicious and affordable options.
- Use public transport, such as buses or daladala (minivans), which are a cheap and efficient way to get around.
- Negotiate prices when shopping at markets or from street vendors, as this is a common practice in Tanzania.
- Avoid traveling during peak season (June to September), when prices for accommodation and tours tend to be higher.
- Learn some basic Swahili phrases, such as "jambo" (hello) and "asante" (thank you), which can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and getting better prices.
