  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Tanzania varies significantly between public and private facilities, with public facilities generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources, while private facilities offer better quality care at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $36 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 27.9% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: TZS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nTanzania has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and long wait times. However, it is often the only option for many locals, particularly in rural areas. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer better quality care and more modern equipment, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, private healthcare facilities are often the preferred option, as they usually have more English-speaking staff and better facilities. It is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can quickly add up.\n\nThe healthcare system in Tanzania is not universal, and many people rely on out-of-pocket payments or private insurance to access healthcare services. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, but more work needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, and many people rely on traditional healing practices or seek care from unqualified providers due to lack of access to modern healthcare facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-20 | $30-50 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-30 | $50-100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-100 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-500 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-300 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-20 | Outpatient care, basic hospitalization |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Inpatient and outpatient care, specialist consultations, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Comprehensive coverage, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medication** is widely available in urban areas, but can be scarce in rural areas\n- **Over-the-counter medication** is available at most pharmacies and markets\n- **Antibiotics** can cost between $5-10 per course\n- **Pain relievers** can cost between $2-5 per pack\n- **Vaccinations** are available at public health facilities, but may require a fee\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to seek care at a private hospital or clinic, as they often have better facilities and more qualified staff. The emergency number in Tanzania is 112, and ambulance services are available in major cities. However, emergency services can be limited in rural areas, and it may be necessary to seek care at a public hospital or clinic. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including the embassy and a private hospital or clinic. It is also a good idea to have a **health insurance plan** that includes evacuation and repatriation coverage, in case of a serious medical emergency.\n\nFor foreigners, the best hospitals for emergency care are often private facilities, such as the **Agakhan Hospital** in Dar es Salaam or the **Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre** in Moshi. These hospitals often have more modern equipment and better qualified staff, and may offer a range of services, including emergency care, surgeries, and specialist consultations. However, it is always best to check with your insurance provider or embassy for recommendations on the best hospitals and medical facilities in the area. [CALLOUT] It is also a good idea to learn some basic **Swahili phrases**, such as \"hospitali\" (hospital) and \"daktari\" (doctor), in case of an emergency.",
