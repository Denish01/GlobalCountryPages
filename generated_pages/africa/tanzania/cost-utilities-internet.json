  "content": "The average cost of utilities and internet in Tanzania can range from $50 to $200 per month, depending on the size of the apartment and the services used.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($120 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.20 per kWh)\nCurrency: TZS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nTanzania's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages affecting many areas, particularly during the dry season from June to October. The costs of utilities in Tanzania can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the region, with prices tend to be higher in urban areas like Dar es Salaam and lower in rural areas. The Tanzanian government has been working to improve the infrastructure, but the progress is slow, and the costs are often passed on to consumers.\n\nThe seasonal variation in utility costs is also significant, with higher costs during the dry season due to increased demand for electricity and water. Additionally, the costs of utilities can vary depending on the type of accommodation, with apartments in high-rise buildings tend to have higher utility costs than standalone houses. The Tanzanian government has implemented a number of measures to reduce the costs of utilities, including the use of renewable energy sources and the promotion of energy-efficient appliances.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $80 | prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | bottled gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$55** | **$100** | **$155** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Tigo, Airtel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Vodacom, Zantel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Tigo, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-50 GB | Vodacom, Zantel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-100 | varies | Tigo, Airtel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | available in Tanzania |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Tanzania |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | services like Bongo Movie |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Tanzania, it is recommended to contact the local utility companies, such as TANESCO for electricity and DAWASCO for water, and provide the necessary documentation, including a copy of the rental agreement and a valid ID.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available in many areas, and can be a cost-effective option for those who want to monitor their energy usage.\n- The best internet providers in Tanzania are Tigo, Airtel, and Vodacom, which offer a range of plans and services, including fiber internet and mobile data.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transportation or walk whenever possible.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with the landlord or property manager to include the utility costs in the rent, as this can be a more cost-effective option than paying for utilities separately.",
