  "content": "Tanzania's economy is a lower-middle-income economy that is driven by a mix of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services, with a growing focus on industrialization and trade.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($64 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($934 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Lower-Middle)\nMain Industries: (Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing)\nCurrency: TZS\nUnemployment Rate: (10% approximate)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 141 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nTanzania is a sovereign country with a lower-middle-income economy, classified as such by the World Bank. The country has been experiencing steady economic growth over the past decade, with an average annual GDP growth rate of around 6-7%. This growth has been driven by a combination of factors, including a growing services sector, increased investment in infrastructure, and a rise in commodity prices. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a large informal sector, limited access to finance, and a dependence on a few key exports.\n\nThe Tanzanian economy is also characterized by a significant development gap between the urban and rural areas, with the former experiencing faster economic growth and higher living standards. The government has been working to address this gap through investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, as well as initiatives to promote rural development and poverty reduction. Overall, Tanzania's economy is on a positive trajectory, but it will require continued reforms and investments to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\nThe country's economic development is also influenced by its strategic location in East Africa, with access to several regional markets and trade agreements. Tanzania is a member of the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which provides it with a large market for its exports and access to a range of trade and investment opportunities. However, the country still faces significant competition from other regional economies, and it will need to continue to invest in its infrastructure and human capital to remain competitive.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 25% of GDP | Main crops include maize, wheat, coffee, and tobacco |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Main minerals include gold, diamonds, and tanzanite |\n| Manufacturing | 15% of GDP | Main products include food and beverages, textiles, and chemicals |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | Main sectors include finance, tourism, and telecommunications |\n| Tourism | 5% of GDP | Main attractions include national parks, wildlife reserves, and beaches |\n| Construction | 5% of GDP | Main activities include building and infrastructure development |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Gold**: Tanzania is one of the largest gold producers in Africa, with most of its gold exports going to India, the UK, and Switzerland.\n- **Coffee**: Tanzania is a significant coffee producer, with most of its coffee exports going to Europe and the US.\n- **Tobacco**: Tanzania is a major tobacco producer, with most of its tobacco exports going to China and other Asian countries.\n- **Cashew nuts**: Tanzania is a significant producer of cashew nuts, with most of its exports going to India and other Asian countries.\n- **Manufactured goods**: Tanzania also exports a range of manufactured goods, including textiles, chemicals, and food products.\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery**: Tanzania imports a significant amount of machinery, including vehicles, electronics, and industrial equipment.\n- **Fuel**: Tanzania imports a large amount of fuel, including petroleum products and natural gas.\n- **Chemicals**: Tanzania imports a range of chemicals, including fertilizers, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals.\n- **Food products**: Tanzania imports a significant amount of food products, including wheat, rice, and maize.\n- **Construction materials**: Tanzania also imports a range of construction materials, including cement, steel, and timber.\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- **China**: China is Tanzania's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade worth over $1 billion.\n- **India**: India is Tanzania's second-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade worth over $500 million.\n- **Kenya**: Kenya is Tanzania's third-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade worth over $300 million.\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Tanzania has a well-developed transportation network, including over 85,000 km of roads, 2,600 km of railways, and several major ports and airports.\n- The country has made significant investments in its energy sector, including the development of natural gas fields and the construction of new power plants.\n- Tanzania has a relatively high level of internet and mobile penetration, with over 40% of the population having access to the internet and over 80% having access to mobile phones.\n- The country has several major ports, including the Port of Dar es Salaam, which is one of the busiest ports in East Africa.\n- Tanzania has several international airports, including Julius Nyerere International Airport, which is a major hub for regional and international flights.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nTanzania's economy is expected to continue growing over the next few years, driven by a range of factors, including increased investment in infrastructure, a rise in commodity prices, and a growing services sector.
