[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Tanzania has a diverse range of transportation modes, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities like Dar es Salaam and Dodoma having more comprehensive systems. Most people in Tanzania get around using **daladala** (minibus) or **bajaji** (three-wheeled taxi) services, which are affordable and widely available. However, the condition of roads and vehicles can be a challenge, especially during the rainy season.

In larger cities, public transportation is relatively well-organized, with designated bus stops and routes. However, in smaller towns and rural areas, transportation options may be limited, and travelers may need to rely on **matatu** (shared taxis) or **pikipiki** (motorcycle taxis). The government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of modern bus systems.
