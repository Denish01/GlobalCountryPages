The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities like Dar es Salaam and Dodoma having more comprehensive systems. Most people in Tanzania get around using **daladala** (minibus) or **bajaji** (three-wheeled taxi) services, which are affordable and widely available. However, the condition of roads and vehicles can be a challenge, especially during the rainy season.\n\nIn larger cities, public transportation is relatively well-organized, with designated bus stops and routes. However, in smaller towns and rural areas, transportation options may be limited, and travelers may need to rely on **matatu** (shared taxis) or **pikipiki** (motorcycle taxis). The government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of modern bus systems.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$20 | Good coverage in larger cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Tanzania |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Extensive network, variable quality |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$2.00 | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.00 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Available in larger cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.50 | $0.30 | $3-$6 | Uber, Bolt available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in cities |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, mostly for highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | Variable quality, frequent departures |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$300 | Typical route, e.g., Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **daladala** or **bajaji** services instead of taxis or ride-hailing apps.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure safety and fair pricing.\n- Always negotiate the fare before starting your journey, especially when using **matatu** or **pikipiki** services.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep valuables secure, especially in crowded public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car or hiring a driver for longer trips or rural areas, as public transportation may be limited.\n- Download ride-hailing apps like Uber or Bolt to get around major cities, and use online resources to plan your route and estimate costs.",
