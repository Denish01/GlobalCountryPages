  "content": "Tanzania is generally cheaper than Uganda, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20% in favor of Tanzania.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTanzania GDP per Capita (PPP): 1,104\nUganda GDP per Capita (PPP): 744\nTanzania Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nUganda Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Tanzania\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Tanzania vs Uganda [/SECTION]\nTanzania and Uganda are two neighboring countries in East Africa, both offering a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. When it comes to the cost of living, Tanzania is generally considered to be the more affordable option, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The economic context of both countries is largely driven by agriculture, with Tanzania having a more diversified economy and a stronger tourism sector. Uganda, on the other hand, has a smaller but more rapidly growing economy, with a focus on infrastructure development and industrialization.\n\nThe cost of living difference between Tanzania and Uganda is significant, with Tanzania being around 15-20% cheaper overall. This is largely due to the lower cost of accommodation, particularly in the larger cities such as Dar es Salaam and Arusha. Additionally, the cost of food and transportation in Tanzania is also lower, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and travelers on a budget. However, it's worth noting that Uganda has a more developed public transportation system, and the cost of internet and mobile phone services is lower in Uganda.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Tanzania (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 250 | 20% more expensive in Uganda |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 180 | 20% more expensive in Uganda |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 500 | 25% more expensive in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Tanzania (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 6 | 20% more expensive in Uganda |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 120 | 20% more expensive in Uganda |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 2.5 | 25% more expensive in Uganda |\n| Coffee | 1 | 1.5 | 50% more expensive in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Tanzania (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 25 | 25% more expensive in Uganda |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.6 | 20% more expensive in Uganda |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1 | 1.1 | 10% more expensive in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Tanzania (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 40 | 20% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 25 | 16% cheaper in Uganda |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 8 | 20% cheaper in Uganda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Tanzania (USD) | Uganda (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 600 | 17% savings in Tanzania |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1000 | 20% savings in Tanzania |\n| Comfortable | 1200 | 1500 | 20% savings in Tanzania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Tanzania is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation, particularly in larger cities\n- Food and dining, with lower prices for meals and groceries\n- Transportation, with lower prices for taxis and fuel\n- Overall cost of living, with a 15-20% difference in favor of Tanzania\n- **Uganda is cheaper for:**\n- Utilities and internet, with lower prices for electricity, water, and mobile phone services\n- Public transportation, with a more developed system and lower prices\n- Coffee and other beverages, with lower prices in cafes and restaurants\n- Mobile phone plans, with lower prices and more options available\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Tanzania and Uganda, the decision ultimately depends on your individual priorities and lifestyle.
