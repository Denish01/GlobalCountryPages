  "content": "The education system in Tanzania is a 7-4-2-3 structure, with seven years of primary education, four years of secondary education, two years of advanced secondary education, and three to four years of university education, providing students with a wide range of learning opportunities.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 77.9%\nSchool System: 13 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Swahili\nAcademic Calendar: 9 months\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 1000 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Tanzania is divided into several levels, with primary education being compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 13. The primary education level is also known as **standard one to seven**, and it is free for all students. After completing primary education, students can proceed to secondary education, which is divided into two levels: **ordinary level** and **advanced level**. Ordinary level education is for four years, while advanced level education is for two years. Students who complete their secondary education can then apply for tertiary education, which includes universities, colleges, and vocational training institutions.\n\nThe quality of education in Tanzania varies between public and private schools. Public schools are often overcrowded and underfunded, which can affect the quality of education. On the other hand, private schools are generally better equipped and have more qualified teachers, but they are also more expensive. The government has been working to improve the quality of education in public schools by implementing various reforms, such as the introduction of **free education** for all students and the recruitment of more qualified teachers.\n\nDespite the efforts to improve the education system, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the major challenges is the lack of infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Many schools in rural areas lack basic facilities such as classrooms, libraries, and laboratories, which can make it difficult for students to learn effectively. Another challenge is the shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in subjects such as mathematics and science.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
