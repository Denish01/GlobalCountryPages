Tanzania has several international airports, with Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro International Airport near Arusha being the main entry points. You can fly directly to Tanzania from major hubs in Europe, Asia, and Africa, including Amsterdam, Dubai, and Nairobi. If you prefer to enter the country overland, you can cross the border from neighboring countries such as Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia. The main overland entry points are at Namanga, Holili, and Tunduma, where you can take a bus or taxi to your final destination.

The main international airports in Tanzania offer a range of facilities, including currency exchange, restaurants, and car rental services. If you are planning to enter the country overland, it is a good idea to research the border crossing procedures and requirements in advance, as these can change frequently. Additionally, be sure to check the current health and safety guidelines before traveling to Tanzania, as these can also change.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Tanzania has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities and tourist destinations. The main domestic airlines are Precision Air, Air Tanzania, and Coastal Aviation, which offer flights to destinations such as Zanzibar, Kilimanjaro, and the Serengeti. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way ticket from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar can cost around $100-$200, while a flight from Arusha to the Serengeti can cost $200-$300. It is a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.

When booking domestic flights, be sure to check the baggage restrictions and requirements, as these can vary between airlines. Additionally, consider booking a flight that includes a scenic route, such as a flight over the Serengeti or Mount Kilimanjaro, for a unique and memorable experience.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Tanzania's rail network is limited, with only a few routes operating between major cities. The main rail line runs from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma, with stops in cities such as Dodoma and Tabora. The trains are often slow and unreliable, but can be a scenic and affordable way to see the countryside. There are no high-speed rail options in Tanzania, and the booking process can be complicated, with limited online resources available. However, taking the train can be a unique and memorable experience, with opportunities to see rural villages and wildlife along the way.

If you are planning to take the train, be sure to research the schedule and booking process in advance, and consider booking a first-class ticket for more comfort and amenities. Additionally, be prepared for delays and changes in the schedule, and consider bringing food and water with you, as these may not be available on the train.

The buses are often crowded and uncomfortable, but can be a affordable way to see the countryside. Prices vary depending on the route and company, but a one-way ticket from Dar es Salaam to Arusha can cost around $10-$20.

When taking the bus, be sure to research the company and route in advance, and consider booking a ticket in advance to ensure availability. Additionally, be prepared for delays and changes in the schedule, and consider bringing food and water with you, as these may not be available on the bus.
