[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Tanzania is a sovereign country with a lower-middle-income economy, classified as such by the World Bank. The country has been experiencing steady economic growth over the past decade, with an average annual GDP growth rate of around 6-7%. This growth has been driven by a combination of factors, including a growing services sector, increased investment in infrastructure, and a rise in commodity prices. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a large informal sector, limited access to finance, and a dependence on a few key exports.

The Tanzanian economy is also characterized by a significant development gap between the urban and rural areas, with the former experiencing faster economic growth and higher living standards. The government has been working to address this gap through investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, as well as initiatives to promote rural development and poverty reduction. Overall, Tanzania's economy is on a positive trajectory, but it will require continued reforms and investments to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.

The country's economic development is also influenced by its strategic location in East Africa, with access to several regional markets and trade agreements. Tanzania is a member of the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which provides it with a large market for its exports and access to a range of trade and investment opportunities. However, the country still faces significant competition from other regional economies, and it will need to continue to invest in its infrastructure and human capital to remain competitive.
