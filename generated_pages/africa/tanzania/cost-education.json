  "content": "The cost of education in Tanzania varies widely, with public schools being generally more affordable, but often lacking in quality, while private and international schools offer higher standards at a significantly higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 3.2%\nLiteracy Rate: 77%\nSchool System: 7 years of compulsory primary education, followed by 4 years of secondary education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: TZS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nTanzania's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. The public sector is generally considered to be of lower quality, with overcrowded classrooms, limited resources, and a lack of qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools in Tanzania offer a higher standard of education, with better facilities, more qualified teachers, and smaller class sizes. The language of instruction in Tanzania is **Swahili**, with **English** being introduced as a second language from the third year of primary school. Compulsory education in Tanzania lasts for 7 years, from the age of 7 to 14, after which students can choose to attend secondary school for a further 4 years.\n\nThe availability of international schools in Tanzania is limited, with most being located in the major cities of **Dar es Salaam** and **Arusha**. These schools offer a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and **British A-levels**, and are generally considered to be of high quality. However, they are also very expensive, making them inaccessible to all but the wealthiest Tanzanians and expatriates.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, overcrowded classrooms |\n| Private Primary | $200-$1,000 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to international standard |\n| Public Secondary | $50-$100 (subsidized) | Limited resources, overcrowded classrooms |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,500 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to international standard |\n| International School | $2,000-$10,000 | High-quality facilities and teaching, range of curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited places, competitive entry |\n| Private University | $1,000-$5,000 | $2,000-$10,000 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to international standard |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$10,000 | $5,000-$20,000 | University of Dar es Salaam, high-quality facilities and teaching |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$100 | Limited availability, especially outside major cities |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Range of quality and subjects, from basic to advanced |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$200 | Range of languages and levels, from beginner to advanced |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Basic supplies, such as textbooks and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools, prices vary depending on quality and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Tanzania are generally considered to be the international schools in **Dar es Salaam** and **Arusha**, which offer a range of curricula and high-quality facilities.\n- Scholarships are available for Tanzanian students, especially for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, but competition is fierce and funding is limited.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Tanzania, with many universities and schools offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The quality of education in Tanzania is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, such as **Kenya** and **South Africa**.\n- The **Tanzanian government** has introduced a range of initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of **free primary education** and the establishment of **teacher training colleges**.\n- Expats and international students should be aware that the education system in Tanzania can be very different from what they are used to, and should research carefully before choosing a school or university.",
