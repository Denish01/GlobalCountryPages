[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Tanzania is divided into several levels, with primary education being compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 13. The primary education level is also known as **standard one to seven**, and it is free for all students. After completing primary education, students can proceed to secondary education, which is divided into two levels: **ordinary level** and **advanced level**. Ordinary level education is for four years, while advanced level education is for two years. Students who complete their secondary education can then apply for tertiary education, which includes universities, colleges, and vocational training institutions.

The quality of education in Tanzania varies between public and private schools. Public schools are often overcrowded and underfunded, which can affect the quality of education. On the other hand, private schools are generally better equipped and have more qualified teachers, but they are also more expensive. The government has been working to improve the quality of education in public schools by implementing various reforms, such as the introduction of **free education** for all students and the recruitment of more qualified teachers.

Despite the efforts to improve the education system, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the major challenges is the lack of infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Many schools in rural areas lack basic facilities such as classrooms, libraries, and laboratories, which can make it difficult for students to learn effectively. Another challenge is the shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in subjects such as mathematics and science.
