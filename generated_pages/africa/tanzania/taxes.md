[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Tanzania has a **territorial taxation** system, where tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the taxpayer's residence. However, residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with a credit given for foreign taxes paid. To be considered a tax resident in Tanzania, an individual must be physically present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year, or have a permanent home in Tanzania and be physically present in the country at any time during the year.

The tax system in Tanzania is administered by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), which is responsible for collecting taxes, as well as providing guidance and support to taxpayers. The TRA also has the authority to conduct audits and investigations to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations. Taxpayers in Tanzania can file their tax returns electronically, and the TRA provides a range of online services and resources to help taxpayers understand and comply with their tax obligations.
