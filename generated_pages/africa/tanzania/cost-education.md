[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Tanzania's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. The public sector is generally considered to be of lower quality, with overcrowded classrooms, limited resources, and a lack of qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools in Tanzania offer a higher standard of education, with better facilities, more qualified teachers, and smaller class sizes. The language of instruction in Tanzania is **Swahili**, with **English** being introduced as a second language from the third year of primary school. Compulsory education in Tanzania lasts for 7 years, from the age of 7 to 14, after which students can choose to attend secondary school for a further 4 years.

The availability of international schools in Tanzania is limited, with most being located in the major cities of **Dar es Salaam** and **Arusha**. These schools offer a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and **British A-levels**, and are generally considered to be of high quality. However, they are also very expensive, making them inaccessible to all but the wealthiest Tanzanians and expatriates.
