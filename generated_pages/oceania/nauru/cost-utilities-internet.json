  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Nauru can be relatively high due to the country's remote location and limited infrastructure, with a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment averaging around $250-$300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($275 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($100 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.35 per kWh)\nCurrency: AUD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nNauru's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with a high reliance on imported fuel for electricity generation. As a result, utility costs can be volatile and subject to fluctuations in global fuel prices. The cost of utilities in Nauru is generally higher during the dry season, which runs from May to October, due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has implemented measures to reduce the country's reliance on imported fuel and increase the use of renewable energy sources, but these efforts are still in the early stages.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Nauru is a major concern, with frequent power outages and water shortages affecting many households. The government has invested in upgrading the country's utility infrastructure, including the construction of a new power plant and improvements to the water supply system. However, much work remains to be done to bring the country's utility infrastructure up to modern standards. Despite these challenges, the cost of utilities in Nauru has remained relatively stable in recent years, with some fluctuations due to changes in global fuel prices.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane or LPG) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 10-20 Mbps | Digicel, Telecom Nauru |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 50-100 Mbps | Digicel, Telecom Nauru |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Digicel, Telecom Nauru |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Digicel, Telecom Nauru |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | Digicel, Telecom Nauru |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | (available with international subscription) |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | (available with international subscription) |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited selection, mostly local content) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Nauru, it's best to contact the relevant providers (Digicel or Telecom Nauru for internet and phone, and the Nauru Utilities Corporation for electricity and water) and arrange for connection at your new address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer better value for heavy users.\n- Digicel and Telecom Nauru are the main internet providers in Nauru, with similar pricing and service quality.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- Be prepared for occasional power outages and water shortages, and consider investing in a backup generator or water storage system if you live in an area prone to these issues.",
