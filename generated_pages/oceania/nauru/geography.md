[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Nauru is a small island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, northeast of Australia. It is situated about 2,800 kilometers northeast of Brisbane, Australia, and is part of the Micronesia region. Nauru does not share any land borders with other countries, but it is nearest to Kiribati, which is located to the east. The island is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and increased storm activity.

Nauru's location in the Pacific Ocean makes it a significant stopover for seabirds and marine life. The island is also an important hub for the Pacific Islands region, with many international organizations and governments maintaining a presence on the island. Despite its small size, Nauru plays an important role in regional affairs and is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum. The island's strategic location also makes it an important location for shipping and trade, with many cargo vessels and passenger ships passing through its waters.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Nauru is a small, circular island with a total land area of approximately 21.3 square kilometers. The island's terrain is generally flat, with a few hills and ridges, including the Command Ridge, which is the highest point on the island. The island's coastline is approximately 30 kilometers long and is characterized by coral reefs, rocky shores, and sandy beaches. The interior of the island is largely barren and rocky, with few trees or other vegetation.

The island's landscape has been significantly altered by phosphate mining, which was the mainstay of Nauru's economy for many years. The mining activities have left large areas of the island barren and devoid of vegetation, and have also created significant environmental problems, including soil erosion and water pollution. Despite these challenges, the island still has some natural beauty, including its coral reefs and marine life, which are popular with tourists and fishermen.

The island's geology is also unique, with a large deposit of phosphate rock that covers much of the island. The phosphate was formed from the guano deposits of seabirds, which accumulated over thousands of years. The phosphate mining activities have extracted much of this resource, leaving behind a legacy of environmental damage and economic challenges for the island.
