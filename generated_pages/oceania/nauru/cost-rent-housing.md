[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Nauru's housing market is relatively small and limited, with a high demand for accommodation due to the country's small size and limited land availability. The rental market is mostly driven by government employees, expatriates, and locals, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months. Deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent, and tenant rights are protected under the Nauru Tenancy Act. Compared to its regional neighbors, Nauru's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in countries like Australia but higher than in some Pacific Island nations.

The Nauru government has implemented various initiatives to address the country's housing shortage, including the development of new residential areas and the renovation of existing buildings. However, the housing market remains competitive, and renters may need to act quickly to secure a suitable property. It is essential for renters to understand their rights and responsibilities under the Nauru Tenancy Act and to carefully review their lease agreement before signing.
