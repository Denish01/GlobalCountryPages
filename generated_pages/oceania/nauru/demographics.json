The population growth rate is relatively slow, at around 0.4% per annum, which is largely due to a combination of factors including a declining fertility rate and a lack of natural resources. The country's population is largely urbanized, with the majority of residents living in the capital city of Yaren. Nauru's population has historically been influenced by migration patterns, with many residents moving to other Pacific Island nations, such as Australia and New Zealand, in search of employment and education opportunities.\n\nThe population of Nauru is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 22.4 years. This is reflected in the country's high percentage of youth, with around 30% of the population under the age of 15. The population density of Nauru is relatively high, at around 555.2 people per square kilometer, which is largely due to the country's small land area. Life expectancy in Nauru is around 66.3 years, which is lower than many other developed countries.\n\nNauru's population has also been impacted by a range of social and economic challenges, including high levels of unemployment and poverty. The country's economy is largely dependent on phosphate mining, which has had a significant impact on the environment and the health of the population.
