# Nauru History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Nauru is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans thousands of years, from the arrival of the first Polynesian settlers to the country's modern era as a sovereign nation.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Nauru began around 1000 BC, when the first Polynesian settlers arrived on the island. These early inhabitants developed a thriving society, with a rich culture and tradition. In 1798, the British explorer John Fearn became the first European to sight Nauru, and over the next century, the island was visited by various European explorers and traders. In 1888, Nauru was annexed by Germany and became a German colony, which had a profound impact on the island's culture, economy, and politics. Following Germany's defeat in World War I, Nauru was mandated to Australia by the League of Nations, and it remained under Australian administration until it gained independence in 1968. Since then, Nauru has faced numerous challenges, including phosphate mining, economic difficulties, and environmental concerns.

The pre-colonial era in Nauru was characterized by a complex system of **chiefs** and **clans**, with a strong emphasis on traditional customs and practices. The arrival of European colonizers had a significant impact on the island's culture and way of life, introducing new technologies, languages, and belief systems. The colonial period was marked by the exploitation of Nauru's natural resources, particularly **phosphate**, which was mined extensively by the Germans and later by the Australians. The legacy of colonialism continues to shape Nauru's modern era, with the country struggling to balance its economic development with environmental and social concerns.

In recent years, Nauru has faced significant challenges, including **climate change**, which poses a major threat to the island's very existence. Rising sea levels, increased storm activity, and drought have all had a devastating impact on Nauru's ecosystem and infrastructure. The country has also struggled with **economic development**, relying heavily on **foreign aid** and **phosphate mining** to sustain its economy. Despite these challenges, Nauru remains a sovereign nation, with a strong sense of identity and a determination to forge its own path in the world.

The modern era in Nauru has been marked by a series of significant events, including the country's **independence** in 1968, the **phosphate boom** of the 1970s and 1980s, and the **environmental crisis** of the 1990s and 2000s.
