  "content": "The cost of transportation in Nauru can vary greatly, with a monthly transit pass costing around $60 USD, while a taxi start rate can be as high as $5 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($60 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($5 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.50 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (No)\nCurrency: AUD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nNauru is a small island nation with limited transportation options. The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and private vehicles. The quality of public transit is relatively poor, with limited routes and frequencies. Most people get around the island by using taxis or private vehicles, as the bus system is not well-developed. The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system makes it difficult for visitors to get around without relying on taxis or rental cars.\n\nThe island's small size and limited infrastructure mean that transportation costs can be relatively high. However, the government has been working to improve the transportation system, including the introduction of new buses and the development of a more comprehensive road network. Despite these efforts, the lack of competition and limited options mean that transportation costs can be high, especially for visitors. The cost of fuel is also relatively high, which can make private vehicle ownership and rental expensive.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $60 | Limited routes and frequencies |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $3 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used for short distances |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$15 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, limited options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.40 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $80-$120 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$30 | Limited options, not always available |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available, Nauru has only one international airport |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using the bus system or walking/biking for short distances.\n- As there are no ride-hailing apps available, it's best to negotiate taxi fares in advance or use a reputable taxi company.\n- Be aware that traffic can be limited, but road conditions can be poor, especially during rainy weather.\n- Consider renting a car for the day to explore the island, but be aware that prices can be high and availability limited.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to ensure safety on the road.\n- Be prepared for limited parking options and high parking fees in the city center.",
