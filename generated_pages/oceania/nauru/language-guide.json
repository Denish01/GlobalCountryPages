  "content": "The official languages spoken in Nauru are Nauruan and English, with Nauruan being the primary language used by the majority of the population.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Nauruan, English\nWidely Spoken: \nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Austronesian\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Nauru is unique, with Nauruan being a distinct language within the Austronesian language family. Nauruan is the primary language used by the majority of the population, with English being widely used as a secondary language, particularly in government, education, and tourism. There are no regional dialects of Nauruan, but the language has been influenced by other Pacific languages, such as Gilbertese, which is spoken in neighboring Kiribati. English is widely understood, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry, but proficiency can vary. Many Nauruans also speak some Gilbertese, particularly in the north of the island.\n\nNauruan is a complex language with its own distinct grammar and vocabulary, and it is an important part of Nauruan culture and identity. Efforts have been made to preserve and promote the language, including the development of a Nauruan language dictionary and language classes for children. Despite the widespread use of English, Nauruan remains the dominant language in everyday life, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Nauruan are likely to be warmly received.\n\nThe use of English in Nauru is largely a legacy of the country's history as a British colony, and it has become an important language for international communication and trade. Many Nauruans have also been educated in English, which has helped to promote its use in government, business, and education. However, there are concerns that the increasing use of English may lead to a decline in the use of Nauruan, and efforts are being made to promote the language and ensure its continued use.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Kam na mauri | kahm nah mow-ree | formal |\n| Hello | Idim | ee-deem | informal |\n| Thank you | Kamsiya | kahm-see-yah |  |\n| Please | Ko | koh |  |\n| Yes / No | Oo / Ei | oh / ay |  |\n| Excuse me | Ekkele | eh-keh-leh |  |\n| How much? | Taofi nena | tah-oh-fee neh-nah |  |\n| Where is...? | Iko ena... | ee-koh eh-nah |  |\n| I don't understand | Nao ko ekkele | nah-oh koh eh-keh-leh |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Ko ekkele ingilis | koh eh-keh-leh eeng-lee-is |  |\n| Help! | Ekkai | eh-kay |  |\n| Goodbye | Tio | tee-oh |  |\n| Sorry | Ekkele | eh-keh-leh |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Tan | tahhn |\n| 2 | Uo | oo-oh |\n| 3 | Iti | ee-tee |\n| 4 | Aua | ah-oo-ah |\n| 5 | Imi | ee-mee |\n| 6 | Ono | oh-noh |\n| 7 | Iti-iti | ee-tee ee-tee |\n| 8 | Aua-ua | ah-oo-ah ah-oo-ah |\n| 9 | Iti-ono | ee-tee oh-noh |\n| 10 | Tanim | tah-neem |\n| 100 | Eka | eh-kah |\n| 1000 | Eka-tanim | eh-kah tah-neem |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when interacting with locals, using formal language and titles such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" when addressing older individuals.\n- Avoid using gestures or body language that may be considered rude or insulting, such as pointing with the feet or touching someone's head.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Nauruan, such as \"Kam na mauri\" (hello) and \"Kamsiya\" (thank you), to show respect and appreciation for the culture.\n- Be patient and listen carefully when communicating, as English proficiency may vary and accents can be strong.\n- Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms when communicating with non-English speakers.\n- Respect local customs and traditions, particularly when visiting villages or attending cultural events.\n- Avoid public displays of affection, such as kissing or hugging, as they are generally frowned upon in Nauruan culture.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication and language barriers.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a language class or workshop to learn more about the Nauruan language and culture.\n- Listen to Nauruan music and watch Nauruan videos to get a feel for the language and culture.\n- Practice speaking with locals and try to learn a few basic phrases in Nauruan to show respect and appreciation for the culture.",
