[SECTION] How Nauru Is Divided [/SECTION]
Nauru is a small island nation with a total area of approximately 21.3 square kilometers. The country is divided into 14 districts, each with its own local government. The districts are not further divided into states or provinces, but rather serve as the primary administrative divisions of the country. The capital, Yaren, is one of the 14 districts and serves as the center of government and commerce.

The administrative structure of Nauru is relatively simple, with the national government responsible for providing services and infrastructure to the entire country. The local governments in each district have some autonomy to manage their own affairs, but the national government plays a significant role in decision-making and resource allocation. This structure allows for efficient governance and coordination, given the small size of the country.
