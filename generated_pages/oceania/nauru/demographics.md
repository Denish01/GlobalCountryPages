[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Nauru has a relatively small population, with a total of approximately 11,680 individuals, according to the latest estimates.

The country's population is largely urbanized, with the majority of residents living in the capital city of Yaren.

This is reflected in the country's high percentage of youth, with around 30% of the population under the age of 15. The population density of Nauru is relatively high, at around 555.2 people per square kilometer, which is largely due to the country's small land area.
