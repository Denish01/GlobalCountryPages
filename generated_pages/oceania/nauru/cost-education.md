[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Nauru is relatively small, with a focus on providing free or subsidized education to all citizens. The public education system is generally considered to be of good quality, with a literacy rate of around 95%. The language of instruction is primarily English, although Nauruan is also taught in schools. Compulsory education lasts for 10 years, from primary to secondary school. There are limited options for private and international schools, but they are available for those who can afford them.

Private education in Nauru is generally considered to be of higher quality than public education, with better resources and more experienced teachers. However, it can be expensive, and is not an option for many Nauruan families. International schools are also available, but they are typically catered towards expat families and can be very expensive. The curriculum is often based on the Australian or New Zealand curriculum, and can provide a good foundation for students who plan to study abroad.
