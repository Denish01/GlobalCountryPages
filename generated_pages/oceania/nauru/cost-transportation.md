[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Nauru is a small island nation with limited transportation options. The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and private vehicles. The quality of public transit is relatively poor, with limited routes and frequencies. Most people get around the island by using taxis or private vehicles, as the bus system is not well-developed. The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system makes it difficult for visitors to get around without relying on taxis or rental cars.

The island's small size and limited infrastructure mean that transportation costs can be relatively high. However, the government has been working to improve the transportation system, including the introduction of new buses and the development of a more comprehensive road network. Despite these efforts, the lack of competition and limited options mean that transportation costs can be high, especially for visitors. The cost of fuel is also relatively high, which can make private vehicle ownership and rental expensive.
