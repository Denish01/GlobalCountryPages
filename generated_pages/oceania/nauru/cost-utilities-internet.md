[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Nauru's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with a high reliance on imported fuel for electricity generation. As a result, utility costs can be volatile and subject to fluctuations in global fuel prices. The cost of utilities in Nauru is generally higher during the dry season, which runs from May to October, due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has implemented measures to reduce the country's reliance on imported fuel and increase the use of renewable energy sources, but these efforts are still in the early stages.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Nauru is a major concern, with frequent power outages and water shortages affecting many households. The government has invested in upgrading the country's utility infrastructure, including the construction of a new power plant and improvements to the water supply system. However, much work remains to be done to bring the country's utility infrastructure up to modern standards. Despite these challenges, the cost of utilities in Nauru has remained relatively stable in recent years, with some fluctuations due to changes in global fuel prices.
