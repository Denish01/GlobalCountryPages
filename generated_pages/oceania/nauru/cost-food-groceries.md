[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Nauru are generally higher compared to the regional average due to the country's remote location and reliance on imports. The cost of living in Nauru is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which affects the prices of groceries and other essential items. As a result, eating out can be expensive, and home cooking is a more affordable option for many residents. The eating-out culture in Nauru is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many people preferring to cook at home using traditional ingredients and recipes.

Despite the high cost of food, Nauru offers a unique culinary experience, with a mix of traditional and modern dishes. The country's cuisine is heavily influenced by its Pacific Island heritage, with popular dishes such as coconut crab, fish, and root vegetables. However, the high cost of imports and limited availability of fresh produce can make it challenging for residents to access a wide range of food options. To mitigate this, many people in Nauru rely on **subsistence farming** and fishing to supplement their diets, which can help reduce their food expenses.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Nauru can be significant, with supermarkets generally offering a wider range of products at higher prices. However, the local market can offer fresher produce and more competitive prices for traditional items such as fruits, vegetables, and seafood. When shopping at the local market, it is essential to **haggle** and negotiate prices, as this is a common practice in Nauru. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have fixed prices, and customers can expect to pay the listed price.

In general, it is recommended to buy fresh produce and traditional items at the local market, while supermarkets may be a better option for imported goods and staples such as rice, flour, and sugar. However, the availability of products can vary depending on the season and supply chain, so it is essential to be flexible and adapt to the local market conditions. By shopping at both supermarkets and local markets, residents and visitors can take advantage of the unique offerings and prices of each.
