The rental market is mostly driven by government employees, expatriates, and locals, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months. Deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent, and tenant rights are protected under the Nauru Tenancy Act. Compared to its regional neighbors, Nauru's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in countries like Australia but higher than in some Pacific Island nations.\n\nThe Nauru government has implemented various initiatives to address the country's housing shortage, including the development of new residential areas and the renovation of existing buildings. However, the housing market remains competitive, and renters may need to act quickly to secure a suitable property. It is essential for renters to understand their rights and responsibilities under the Nauru Tenancy Act and to carefully review their lease agreement before signing.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$600 | $200-$400 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $500-$800 | $300-$600 | Fully furnished, self-contained |\n| 2 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $500-$900 | Suitable for families, modern appliances |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,400 | Spacious, fully equipped, secure parking |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, close to amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | Residential areas, convenient access to town |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | Limited amenities, scenic views, peaceful environment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Yaren**: The capital city, with a range of accommodation options, including apartments and houses, $500-$1,000 per month\n- **Denigomodu**: A residential area with modern amenities, close to the city center, $400-$900 per month\n- **Nibok**: A coastal neighborhood with scenic views, suitable for families, $300-$700 per month\n- **Anetan**: A quiet, rural area with limited amenities, ideal for those seeking a peaceful environment, $200-$500 per month\n- **Buada**: A lagoon-side neighborhood with stunning views, popular with expats, $600-$1,200 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Nauru [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and understand the current prices and trends to avoid overpaying\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable property\n- Carefully review the lease agreement and ensure you understand the terms and conditions\n- Consider factors such as proximity to work, schools, and amenities when choosing a neighborhood\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market can be competitive, and properties may be snapped up quickly\n- [CALLOUT] Be aware of scams and ensure you are dealing with a legitimate landlord or property manager to avoid potential pitfalls.",
