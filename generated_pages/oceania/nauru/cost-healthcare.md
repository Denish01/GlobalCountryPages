[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Nauru's healthcare system is primarily public, with the government providing most healthcare services through the Nauru Hospital and various community health centers. The public healthcare system is generally free or low-cost for locals, but the quality of care can be limited, and there may be long waiting times for certain services. For foreigners, the cost of healthcare can be higher, and it is recommended that they have health insurance that covers them for medical treatment in Nauru. Private healthcare services are limited in Nauru, but there are some private clinics and medical facilities that offer more comprehensive care, often at a higher cost.

The healthcare system in Nauru is generally geared towards providing basic medical care, with more complex medical procedures often requiring medical evacuation to other countries, such as Australia or New Zealand. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of new medical equipment and the training of healthcare professionals. However, the healthcare system in Nauru still faces various challenges, including limited resources, a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease.
