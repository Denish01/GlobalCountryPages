        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Nauru, a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean, has a unique and complex history. The island was first inhabited by Micronesian and Polynesian peoples around 1000 BC. In 1798, British sailor John Fearn became the first European to visit the island. Nauru was subsequently claimed by Germany in 1888 and became a German colony. During World War I, Nauru was occupied by Australia, and after the war, it was mandated to Australia by the League of Nations. In 1947, the United Nations Trust Territory of Nauru was established, with Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as trustees. Nauru gained its independence on January 31, 1968.</p>
        <p>Nauru's history is closely tied to the phosphate mining industry, which began in the early 20th century. The island's phosphate deposits were discovered in 1900, and mining began in 1906. The phosphate industry dominated Nauru's economy for many years and played a significant role in the country's development. In 1967, the Nauru Phosphate Corporation was established to manage the industry, and it remains a key player in the country's economy today.</p>
        <p>Nauru's path to independence was marked by a series of agreements and negotiations with the trustee countries. The Nauru Independence Convention was held in 1967, and the country's constitution was adopted on January 17, 1968. On January 31, 1968, Nauru officially gained its independence, with Hammer DeRoburt as its first president. Since then, Nauru has developed its own government, economy, and international relationships.</p>
        <p>Today, Nauru is a sovereign nation and a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Pacific Islands Forum. The country continues to face challenges related to its small size, limited resources, and remote location. However, Nauru has made significant progress in recent years, and its people are working to build a sustainable and prosperous future.</p>
