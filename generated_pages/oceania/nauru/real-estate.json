However, the market is also subject to fluctuations in the global economy, particularly in the phosphate mining industry, which is the primary source of revenue for the country.\n\nThe price trajectory of properties in Nauru has been relatively stable in recent years, with some fluctuations due to changes in the global economy. However, the prices are generally considered to be high compared to other Pacific Island nations, due to the limited availability of land and the high demand for housing.
