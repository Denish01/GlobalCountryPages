        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Nauru's economy is a unique case, driven primarily by its rich phosphate deposits. The country has been heavily reliant on phosphate mining, which has been the mainstay of its economy for decades. However, the depletion of phosphate reserves has led to a significant decline in the country's economic fortunes. Nauru is classified as an upper-middle-income economy, but its development level is hindered by its limited economic diversification and lack of infrastructure. The country's economy is also heavily influenced by its remote location and limited connectivity to the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>Nauru's economic trajectory has been marked by significant challenges, including a decline in phosphate production, a lack of economic diversification, and a heavy reliance on foreign aid. The country has struggled to develop other industries, including manufacturing and tourism, due to its limited resources and infrastructure. However, the government has been working to develop the country's financial services sector, which has shown promise as a potential driver of economic growth.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, Nauru's economy has shown resilience, and the government has been working to implement reforms to diversify the economy and improve the business environment. The country has also been working to develop its renewable energy sector, which is seen as a key area of growth. With the support of international organizations and donor countries, Nauru is working to overcome its economic challenges and achieve sustainable economic growth.</p>
