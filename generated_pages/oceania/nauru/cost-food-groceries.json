The cost of living in Nauru is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which affects the prices of groceries and other essential items. As a result, eating out can be expensive, and home cooking is a more affordable option for many residents. The eating-out culture in Nauru is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many people preferring to cook at home using traditional ingredients and recipes.\n\nDespite the high cost of food, Nauru offers a unique culinary experience, with a mix of traditional and modern dishes. The country's cuisine is heavily influenced by its Pacific Island heritage, with popular dishes such as coconut crab, fish, and root vegetables. However, the high cost of imports and limited availability of fresh produce can make it challenging for residents to access a wide range of food options. To mitigate this, many people in Nauru rely on **subsistence farming** and fishing to supplement their diets, which can help reduce their food expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 3.75 AUD | Imported from Australia |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.00 | 3.00 AUD | Locally baked |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $3.00 | 4.50 AUD | Imported from Australia |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50 | 2.25 AUD | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8.00 | 12.00 AUD | Imported from Australia |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12.00 | 18.00 AUD | Imported from Australia |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 7.50 AUD | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3.00 | 4.50 AUD | Locally grown |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2.00 | 3.00 AUD | Locally grown |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.50 | 2.25 AUD | Locally grown |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10.00 | 15.00 AUD | Limited availability |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.50 | 2.25 AUD | Locally bottled |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | Traditional dishes such as coconut crab and fish |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | One person, limited options |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$40 | Three courses, moderate prices |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$75 | Upscale, limited options |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | Limited availability |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$10 | Wide range of options |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | Limited availability |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | Wide range of options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Nauru can be significant, with supermarkets generally offering a wider range of products at higher prices. However, the local market can offer fresher produce and more competitive prices for traditional items such as fruits, vegetables, and seafood. When shopping at the local market, it is essential to **haggle** and negotiate prices, as this is a common practice in Nauru. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have fixed prices, and customers can expect to pay the listed price.\n\nIn general, it is recommended to buy fresh produce and traditional items at the local market, while supermarkets may be a better option for imported goods and staples such as rice, flour, and sugar. However, the availability of products can vary depending on the season and supply chain, so it is essential to be flexible and adapt to the local market conditions. By shopping at both supermarkets and local markets, residents and visitors can take advantage of the unique offerings and prices of each.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Nauru is to buy fresh produce and traditional items at the local market and cook at home.\n- **Coconut crab** is a local staple that is good value and can be found at many restaurants and markets.\n- **Fresh fish** is widely available and can be purchased at a reasonable price, making it a great option for those looking for a affordable and healthy meal.\n- It is recommended to avoid buying imported goods such as meat and dairy products, as they can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- **Root vegetables** such as taro and yam are widely available and can be purchased at a low cost, making them a great addition to any meal.\n- Visitors and residents can also try **traditional dishes** such as fish stew and coconut rice, which are often served at local restaurants and markets.",
