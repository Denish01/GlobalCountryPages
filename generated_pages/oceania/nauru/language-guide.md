[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Nauru is unique, with Nauruan being a distinct language within the Austronesian language family. Nauruan is the primary language used by the majority of the population, with English being widely used as a secondary language, particularly in government, education, and tourism. There are no regional dialects of Nauruan, but the language has been influenced by other Pacific languages, such as Gilbertese, which is spoken in neighboring Kiribati. English is widely understood, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry, but proficiency can vary. Many Nauruans also speak some Gilbertese, particularly in the north of the island.

Nauruan is a complex language with its own distinct grammar and vocabulary, and it is an important part of Nauruan culture and identity. Efforts have been made to preserve and promote the language, including the development of a Nauruan language dictionary and language classes for children. Despite the widespread use of English, Nauruan remains the dominant language in everyday life, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Nauruan are likely to be warmly received.

The use of English in Nauru is largely a legacy of the country's history as a British colony, and it has become an important language for international communication and trade. Many Nauruans have also been educated in English, which has helped to promote its use in government, business, and education. However, there are concerns that the increasing use of English may lead to a decline in the use of Nauruan, and efforts are being made to promote the language and ensure its continued use.
