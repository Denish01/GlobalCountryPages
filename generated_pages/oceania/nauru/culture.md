# Nauru Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Nauru's culture is a unique blend of traditional and modern influences, shaped by its history as a small island nation in the Pacific. The Nauruan people are the indigenous inhabitants of the island, and their culture is characterized by a strong sense of community and respect for tradition. The country's cultural identity is also influenced by its historical ties to other Pacific Island nations, as well as its more recent interactions with European and Australian cultures. The Nauruan language is the primary language spoken on the island, but English is also widely spoken, particularly in formal and business settings.

The ethnic makeup of Nauru is predominantly Nauruan, with a small number of expatriates and foreign workers. The country's cultural identity is closely tied to its traditional way of life, which is based on fishing, agriculture, and community-based activities. The Nauruan people place a strong emphasis on family and community, and their cultural practices and traditions reflect this. For example, the traditional Nauruan system of **chiefly titles** and **clans** is still an important part of Nauruan society, and is reflected in the country's social and cultural practices.

Nauru's cultural identity is also influenced by its Christian heritage, which was introduced to the island by European missionaries in the 19th century. Today, Christianity is the predominant religion in Nauru, and plays an important role in the country's cultural and social life. The Nauruan people are known for their warm hospitality and welcoming nature, and visitors to the island are often struck by the strong sense of community and camaraderie that exists among the local population.
