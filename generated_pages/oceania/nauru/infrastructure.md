# Nauru Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Nauru is relatively underdeveloped, with limited access to reliable electricity, water, and transportation, posing significant challenges to the country's economic growth and development.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 80% of population
Internet Penetration: 35%
Road Network: 30 km, poor quality
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 1
Major Ports: 1
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Nauru's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including a decline in phosphate mining, which was the primary source of revenue. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's energy sector, with a shift towards renewable energy sources. However, much work remains to be done to address the country's infrastructure deficit. The government has been working to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.

The country's small size and remote location make it difficult to develop and maintain a comprehensive infrastructure network. The lack of economies of scale and high transportation costs also contribute to the challenges faced by the country. Despite these challenges, the government has been working to develop the country's infrastructure, with a focus on improving the business environment and attracting foreign investment. The Asian Development Bank and other international organizations have provided significant funding and technical assistance to support the country's infrastructure development.

Nauru's infrastructure development has also been hindered by a lack of skilled labor and limited access to technology. The country has a small and relatively unskilled workforce, which can make it difficult to maintain and operate complex infrastructure systems. The government has been working to address this issue through training programs and education initiatives. However, much work remains to be done to develop the country's human resources and increase its capacity to manage and maintain its infrastructure.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- The primary source of electricity in Nauru is diesel generators, which are expensive and unreliable.
- The country has made significant progress in recent years in increasing access to electricity, with 80% of the population now having access to electricity.
- However, power outages are still frequent, and the reliability of the energy supply is a major concern.
- The government has been working to develop the country's renewable energy sector, with a focus on solar and wind power.
- A new solar power plant has been constructed with funding from the Australian government, which is expected to increase the country's energy security and reduce its reliance on diesel generators.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- Access to safe drinking water is a major challenge in Nauru, with many households relying on rainwater collection and wells.
- The country's water supply is limited, and the quality of the water is often poor, with high levels of contamination and salinity.
- Sanitation coverage is also limited, with many households lacking access to proper toilets and sewage systems.
- The government has been working to improve the country's water and sanitation infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to safe drinking water and improving sanitation facilities.
- A new water supply project has been launched with funding from the Asian Development Bank, which aims to increase access to safe drinking water for all households in the country.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- Mobile phone coverage is widespread in Nauru, with most households having access to a mobile phone.
- However, internet penetration is limited, with only 35% of the population having access to the internet.
- The country's telecommunications sector is dominated by a single provider, which has limited competition and innovation.
- The government has been working to improve the country's telecommunications infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to broadband and improving the reliability of the network.
- A new fiber-optic cable has been laid with funding from the World Bank, which is expected to increase the country's internet bandwidth and improve the quality of the network.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The Nauru government has launched a major infrastructure development project, which aims to improve the country's roads, ports, and energy infrastructure.
- The project is being funded by the Asian Development Bank and the Australian government, and is expected to be completed over the next five years.
- The government has also launched a new water supply project, which aims to increase access to safe drinking water for all households in the country.
- A new solar power plant has been constructed with funding from the Australian government, which is expected to increase the country's energy security and reduce its reliance on diesel generators.
- The government has also been working to improve the country's telecommunications infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to broadband and improving the reliability of the network.
