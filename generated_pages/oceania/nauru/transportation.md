[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Nauru International Airport is the main entry point to the country, with direct flights from Brisbane, Australia, and Nadi, Fiji, operated by **Nauru Airlines** and **Pacific Air**. There are no overland entry points, as Nauru is a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean. The airport is located near the capital, Yaren, and is the hub for all international flights to and from the country. 

Travelers can fly to Nauru from major airports in Australia, Fiji, and other Pacific Island nations, with connecting flights available from Asia, Europe, and North America. However, flight schedules and availability may be limited, so it's essential to plan and book ahead. The airport is relatively small, with basic facilities, including a restaurant, shop, and currency exchange office. Upon arrival, visitors can take a taxi or bus to their destination, as there are no car rental desks or ride-hailing services available at the airport.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
There are no domestic flights within Nauru, as the country is small and the distance between the capital, Yaren, and other parts of the island is relatively short. However, **Nauru Airlines** operates charter flights to the surrounding islands and atolls, which can be booked in advance. The cost of charter flights varies depending on the destination and the number of passengers, but approximate costs range from $200 to $500 per person for a one-way trip. It's recommended to book charter flights through a local travel agent or tour operator, as they can provide more information and assistance with booking and arrangements.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in Nauru, as the country's small size and limited infrastructure make it unnecessary. The lack of a rail network means that visitors must rely on other modes of transportation, such as taxis, buses, and car rentals, to get around the island. 

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There is a limited bus service in Nauru, operated by the **Nauru Bus Service**, which connects the capital, Yaren, with other parts of the island. The buses are not very frequent, and the routes are limited, but they provide a cheap and convenient way to get around. The cost of a bus ticket is around $2-$5, depending on the distance traveled. However, the bus service is not very reliable, and visitors may need to wait for a long time for a bus to arrive.
