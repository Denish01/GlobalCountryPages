The public healthcare system is generally free or low-cost for locals, but the quality of care can be limited, and there may be long waiting times for certain services. For foreigners, the cost of healthcare can be higher, and it is recommended that they have health insurance that covers them for medical treatment in Nauru. Private healthcare services are limited in Nauru, but there are some private clinics and medical facilities that offer more comprehensive care, often at a higher cost.\n\nThe healthcare system in Nauru is generally geared towards providing basic medical care, with more complex medical procedures often requiring medical evacuation to other countries, such as Australia or New Zealand. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of new medical equipment and the training of healthcare professionals. However, the healthcare system in Nauru still faces various challenges, including limited resources, a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have limited hours and services |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Limited specialist services available in public system |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public clinics may have limited eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospital may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$200 | Private hospitals offer more comprehensive care |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | More complex surgeries may require medical evacuation |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals offer more comprehensive maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Limited availability of MRI scans in public system |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public clinics may have limited X-ray services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital and clinic services, limited specialist care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Private hospital and clinic services, comprehensive specialist care |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Medical evacuation, comprehensive international coverage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication is generally available at public clinics and private pharmacies, with costs ranging from $5-$20 per prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at private pharmacies, with costs ranging from $5-$10 per item.\n- Public clinics may have limited availability of certain medications, and patients may need to purchase them from private pharmacies.\n- Some medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, may require a prescription from a doctor.\n- Pharmacy hours are generally limited, with most pharmacies closing by 5 pm.\n- Credit cards and cash are widely accepted at private pharmacies, but public clinics may only accept cash.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, patients should call the emergency number 110 or visit the Nauru Hospital, which is the main public hospital in the country.
