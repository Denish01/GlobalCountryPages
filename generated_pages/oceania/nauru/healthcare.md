[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Nauru's healthcare system is primarily publicly funded, with the government providing basic medical services through its public health facilities. However, the quality of care is often limited by a lack of resources, equipment, and specialized medical personnel. The public healthcare system is generally accessible to all citizens, but the private sector plays a minor role in providing additional services. Urban areas, such as the capital Yaren, tend to have better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas. Despite these challenges, the Nauruan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investments in healthcare infrastructure and training for medical staff.

The healthcare system in Nauru faces significant challenges, including a high burden of **non-communicable diseases** such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, which are major contributors to morbidity and mortality. The system also struggles with limited access to specialized care, particularly for conditions requiring advanced medical interventions. As a result, many patients are referred overseas for treatment, often to Australia or New Zealand, which can be costly and logistically challenging.

Nauru's geographic isolation and limited resources also pose significant challenges to the healthcare system. The country's small size and lack of economic diversification make it difficult to attract and retain skilled medical professionals, and the healthcare system is often reliant on foreign aid and assistance. Despite these challenges, the Nauruan government is working to strengthen its healthcare system and improve access to quality medical care for its citizens.
