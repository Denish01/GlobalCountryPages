# The Truth About Fiji - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Fiji, an island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, has a rich and diverse history. The first inhabitants of Fiji were the **Lapita people**, who arrived around 1000 BCE. These early settlers developed a complex society, with a system of chiefs and a thriving trade network. In 1643, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight Fiji. However, it was not until the 19th century that European colonization began in earnest. Fiji was ceded to Britain in 1874, and it became a **British colony**. During this period, the British brought large numbers of indentured laborers from India to work on Fiji's sugar plantations.
