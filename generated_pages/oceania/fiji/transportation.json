  "content": "To get around in Fiji, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and rental cars, as well as ferries to travel between the islands.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Nadi International Airport (NAN), Nausori International Airport (SUV)\nDomestic Air Network: extensive\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nFiji is easily accessible by air, with two main international airports: Nadi International Airport and Nausori International Airport, which is located near the capital city of Suva. Nadi International Airport is the primary entry point for most visitors, with direct flights from major hubs such as Los Angeles, Sydney, and Auckland. You can also fly into Fiji from other Pacific Island nations, such as Tonga and Vanuatu. There are no overland entry points to Fiji, as it is an island nation.\n\nIf you're traveling from within the Pacific region, you can also take a ferry or a cruise ship to Fiji. However, this option is less common and typically takes longer than flying. Fiji's main ports are located in Suva, Lautoka, and Levuka, and they receive cargo ships and cruise liners from around the world. To get to Fiji, you can also consider flying into a nearby country, such as New Zealand or Australia, and then taking a connecting flight to Fiji.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nFiji has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between the main islands. The main domestic airlines are Fiji Airways, Northern Air, and Pacific Island Air. They operate flights from Nadi International Airport and Nausori International Airport to other islands, such as Taveuni, Kadavu, and the Mamanuca and Yasawa island groups. You can book domestic flights online or through a local travel agent, and approximate costs range from $100 to $300 USD per person for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and airline.\n\nWhen booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to book in advance to secure the best rates, especially during peak travel seasons. You can also consider booking a package deal that includes accommodation and activities, which can be a convenient and cost-effective option. Additionally, some airlines offer special discounts for residents, students, and seniors, so it's worth checking with the airline to see if you're eligible for any discounts.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nFiji does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. However, there are plans to develop a railway system in the future, which would connect the main cities and towns. For now, you'll need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around the islands.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nFiji has a moderate network of buses and coaches that operate on the main islands. The main bus companies are Pacific Transport, Coral Sun, and Sunbeam Transport, and they offer routes between the major towns and cities. Bus fares are relatively affordable, with prices starting from around $1 to $5 USD per trip, depending on the route and distance. You can pay the driver directly when you board the bus, and it's a good idea to have small bills and coins handy.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Suva, Nadi, Lautoka | $1-$3 | Frequent services, affordable |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10/km | Metered taxis, available at airports and towns |\n| Ride-Hailing | Suva, Nadi | $5-$10 | Local alternatives, such as Vatu and Yatu |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Some islands | $5-$10 | Limited availability, negotiable fares |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Fiji, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country or an international driver's license.\n- Road conditions in Fiji can be moderate to poor, especially on rural roads and during the wet season.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high in Fiji, with prices starting from around $1.50 USD per liter.\n- Car rental companies are available at the main airports and towns, and prices start from around $40 USD per day.\n- When driving in Fiji, be aware of the local traffic rules and customs, such as driving on the left-hand side of the road and wearing a seatbelt.\n- Be cautious when driving at night, as some roads can be poorly lit and there may be pedestrians and animals on the road.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- When taking a taxi, make sure to agree on the fare before you start your journey, or ensure the meter is working.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas and public transport.\n- When using local buses, be prepared for crowded conditions and limited luggage space.\n- Consider downloading local transport apps, such as Vatu and Yatu, to book rides and track your journey.\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, especially when visiting rural areas and villages.\n- When driving, be mindful of the local speed limits and road conditions, and avoid driving at night if possible.\n- Consider purchasing travel insurance that covers transportation and accidents, in case of any unexpected events.\n- Be prepared for occasional transport disruptions, such as strikes or natural disasters, and plan accordingly.",
