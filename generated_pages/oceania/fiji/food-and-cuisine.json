The traditional Fijian diet consists of fresh seafood, root vegetables, and coconuts, while Indian and Chinese cuisine has introduced a wide range of spices, vegetables, and cooking techniques. Regional variations are also evident, with the eastern islands having a stronger Polynesian influence and the western islands having a more Indian-influenced cuisine. As a result, Fijian cuisine is a unique and flavorful blend of different cultures and traditions.\n\nFijian cuisine is also known for its use of **lovo**, a traditional underground oven, which is used to cook a variety of dishes, including meat, fish, and vegetables. The lovo is a central part of Fijian culture and is often used for special occasions and celebrations. In addition to lovo, Fijian cuisine also makes use of **coconut milk**, which is a staple ingredient in many dishes, including curries, soups, and desserts.\n\nThe Fijian diet is also influenced by its tropical climate, with a wide range of fresh fruits and vegetables available throughout the year. Popular fruits include **mangoes**, **pineapples**, and **papayas**, while popular vegetables include **taro**, **yams**, and **cassava**. With its unique blend of cultural influences and fresh, local ingredients, Fijian cuisine is a must-try when visiting the islands.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kokoda | Raw Fish | Raw fish marinated in coconut milk and lime juice | High-end restaurants in Suva and Nadi |\n| Palusami | Vegetable Dish | Steamed taro leaves filled with coconut cream and vegetables | Traditional Fijian restaurants |\n| Lovo | Meat Dish | Meat cooked in an underground oven with coconut milk and spices | Traditional Fijian restaurants |\n| Vaka | Seafood Dish | Fresh seafood cooked in coconut milk and spices | Seafood restaurants in coastal areas |\n| Duruka | Vegetable Dish | Steamed or boiled duruka (a type of yam) served with coconut milk and spices | Local markets and food stalls |\n| Wahoo | Fish Dish | Grilled or fried wahoo fish served with coconut milk and spices | Seafood restaurants in coastal areas |\n| Rakiraki | Meat Dish | Grilled or fried meat (usually pork or chicken) served with coconut milk and spices | Local markets and food stalls |\n| Thali | Indian Dish | A selection of Indian curries and side dishes, including rice, roti, and vegetables | Indian restaurants in Suva and Nadi |\n| Vakalolo | Dessert | A traditional Fijian dessert made with coconut milk, sugar, and flour | Local markets and food stalls |\n| Kava | Beverage | A traditional Fijian drink made from the roots of the kava plant | Local markets and food stalls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Pineapple and coconut** from street vendors, $1-$2 USD\n- **Fresh fish** from markets, $5-$10 USD per kilogram\n- **Vakalolo** from local bakeries, $2-$3 USD per piece\n- **Kava** from street vendors, $2-$5 USD per cup\n- **Duruka** from local markets, $1-$2 USD per piece\n- **Fried cassava** from street vendors, $2-$3 USD per serving\n- **Coconut water** from street vendors, $1-$2 USD per liter\n- **Fresh fruit salad** from markets, $3-$5 USD per serving\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Kava**, a traditional Fijian drink made from the roots of the kava plant, $2-$5 USD per cup\n- **Coconut water**, a refreshing and hydrating drink, $1-$2 USD per liter\n- **Fresh fruit juice**, such as pineapple or orange, $3-$5 USD per liter\n- **Fijian beer**, such as Fiji Gold or Fiji Bitter, $5-$10 USD per bottle\n- **Wine**, available in most restaurants and bars, $10-$20 USD per bottle\n- **Fresh coconut milk**, a creamy and delicious drink, $2-$3 USD per liter\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with your hands** is common in traditional Fijian settings, but not in formal restaurants\n- **Tipping** is expected in restaurants and bars, 5-10% of the total bill\n- **Reservations** are recommended for high-end restaurants, especially during peak season\n- **Dress code** is casual in most restaurants, but formal attire may be required in high-end establishments\n- **Trying local cuisine** is highly encouraged, and many restaurants offer traditional Fijian dishes\n- **Learning a few Fijian phrases**, such as \"kerekere\" (please) and \"vinaka\" (thank you), can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local markets**, such as the Suva Municipal Market, offer a wide range of fresh produce and traditional Fijian dishes\n- **Food courts**, such as the one in the Port Denarau Marina, offer a variety of international cuisine, including Fijian, Indian, and Chinese\n- **Traditional Fijian restaurants**, such as the ones in the village of Navala, offer a unique and authentic dining experience\n- **High-end restaurants**, such as the ones in the resorts of the Coral Coast, offer fine dining and international cuisine\n- **Street food stalls**, such as the ones in the town of Nadi, offer a quick and affordable meal\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Suva Municipal Market**, located in the heart of Suva, offers a wide range of fresh produce, traditional Fijian dishes, and local handicrafts\n- **Port Denarau Marina**, located in Nadi, offers a variety of international cuisine, including Fijian, Indian, and Chinese, as well as a range of shops and entertainment options\n- **Navala Village**, located in the Ba Province, offers a unique and authentic Fijian dining experience, with traditional Fijian cuisine and cultural performances\n- **Koroyanitu National Heritage Park**, located in the Lautoka Province, offers a range of traditional Fijian dishes, including lovo and kokoda, as well as stunning natural scenery and hiking trails\n- **Fiji Food Festival**, held annually in Suva, offers a celebration of Fijian cuisine, with food stalls, cooking demonstrations, and cultural performances",
