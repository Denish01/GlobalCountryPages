[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji's healthcare system is structured to provide universal access to healthcare services, with both public and private providers playing a crucial role. The public healthcare system is managed by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, which operates hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country. The quality of care in public facilities can vary, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed hospitals than rural areas. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality services, but at a higher cost. The majority of the population relies on public healthcare services, while those who can afford it opt for private care.

The quality of care in Fiji is generally good, with many healthcare professionals having received training in countries such as Australia and New Zealand. However, there are still challenges related to access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas where facilities and personnel may be limited. Urban areas, such as Suva and Nadi, have better access to healthcare services, including specialized care and advanced medical equipment.

Despite these challenges, Fiji has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on preventive care, health promotion, and disease control. The government has also implemented initiatives to increase access to healthcare services, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, women, and the elderly.
