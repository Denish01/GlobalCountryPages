[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji's internet quality is generally good, with average download speeds of 10 Mbps, allowing for smooth browsing, social media, and video streaming. However, there is a notable urban vs rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in urban areas like Suva and Nadi, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in Fiji is also affected by the weather, with heavy rainfall and cyclones potentially causing disruptions to services.

The Fijian government has been investing in the development of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, including the rollout of fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of mobile networks. This has led to improvements in internet speeds and coverage, particularly in urban areas. However, more needs to be done to address the rural-urban divide and ensure that all areas of the country have access to reliable and fast internet services.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Fiji is relatively easy, with several mobile carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. The two main carriers, Vodafone and Digicel, have outlets at Nadi International Airport and in major towns, where you can purchase a SIM card with a valid passport and proof of address. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans start from around 5 USD for 1 GB of data. Recommended carriers include Vodafone, Digicel, and Inkk Mobile, which offer a range of plans to suit different needs and budgets.

It's worth noting that some carriers may require you to register your SIM card, which can be done at the point of purchase or online. This is a straightforward process that requires you to provide some personal details and proof of identity. Once you have purchased and registered your SIM card, you can top up your account with credit, which can be done at outlets across the country or online.
