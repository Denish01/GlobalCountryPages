[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Fijian property market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by tourism and foreign investment. The market is characterized by a mix of **freehold** and **leasehold** properties, with the latter being more common. Prices have been increasing, particularly in urban areas such as Suva and Nadi, where demand for housing and commercial space is high. The rural areas, on the other hand, offer more affordable options, but with limited amenities and infrastructure. The Fijian government has implemented various initiatives to promote foreign investment and stimulate economic growth, which has had a positive impact on the property market.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a range of properties available, from **residential homes** to **commercial spaces**. However, the market can be competitive, particularly in popular areas, and buyers need to be prepared to act quickly when they find a suitable property. The price trajectory is expected to continue upward, driven by demand from foreign investors and locals alike. Urban areas are experiencing the most significant growth, with prices increasing by up to 10% per annum in some areas.

The Fijian property market is also characterized by a strong **rental market**, with many locals and expatriates seeking rental accommodation. This presents opportunities for investors to generate rental income, particularly in areas with high demand such as Suva and Nadi. However, the rental market is subject to regulations, and landlords must comply with **tenancy laws** and **rental regulations**.
