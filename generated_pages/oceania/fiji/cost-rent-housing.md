[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji's rental market is relatively stable, with a mix of modern apartments and traditional houses available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under the Fiji Rental Housing Act, which outlines the responsibilities of landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Tonga and Vanuatu, Fiji's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a balance between affordability and quality of living. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with Suva and other urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas.

The Fijian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the housing market, including the development of affordable housing schemes and the provision of subsidies for low-income families. Despite these efforts, there is still a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly in urban areas. As a result, many residents opt for shared accommodation or look for apartments outside of the city center. Expats and foreigners can also find suitable housing options, but may need to be prepared for higher prices and a more competitive market.
