Fiji has a smaller economy with a GDP per capita of $9,900, while New Zealand has a more developed economy with a GDP per capita of $43,600. The cost of living in Fiji is generally lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper than in New Zealand. Fiji's economy is driven by tourism, agriculture, and remittances, while New Zealand's economy is more diversified, with a strong service sector and a significant manufacturing industry.\n\nThe overall cost of living in Fiji is approximately 30-40% lower than in New Zealand.
