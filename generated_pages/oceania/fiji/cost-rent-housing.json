Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under the Fiji Rental Housing Act, which outlines the responsibilities of landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Tonga and Vanuatu, Fiji's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a balance between affordability and quality of living. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with Suva and other urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas.\n\nThe Fijian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the housing market, including the development of affordable housing schemes and the provision of subsidies for low-income families. Despite these efforts, there is still a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly in urban areas. As a result, many residents opt for shared accommodation or look for apartments outside of the city center. Expats and foreigners can also find suitable housing options, but may need to be prepared for higher prices and a more competitive market.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | modern appliances, secure building |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $400-$800 | family size, spacious living area |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,500 | $600-$1,200 | luxurious finishes, prime location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$4,000 | prime locations, modern developments |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,500 | residential areas, established neighborhoods |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | rural areas, agricultural land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Suva Point: $400-$700 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a popular area with modern amenities and a vibrant nightlife\n- Tamavua: $300-$600 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a family-friendly neighborhood with easy access to schools and shopping centers\n- Lami: $250-$500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a coastal area with a relaxed atmosphere and stunning ocean views\n- Nabua: $200-$400 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a residential area with a mix of traditional and modern housing options\n- Laucala Bay: $500-$1,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, an upscale area with luxurious amenities and a prime location\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Fiji [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and compare prices to find the best value for your budget\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property and navigate the rental process\n- Be prepared to provide documentation, such as a passport and proof of income, to secure a rental agreement\n- [CALLOUT] Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit without inspecting the property and signing a formal agreement\n- Utilities, such as electricity and water, are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Fiji, so be prepared to provide your own furniture and appliances if necessary",
