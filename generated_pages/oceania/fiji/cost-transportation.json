The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Suva and Nadi having more frequent and reliable services. Most people in Fiji get around using buses, which are an affordable and convenient option, or by using taxis, which are readily available in urban areas. The country's geography, with many islands and rugged terrain, can make transportation challenging, but the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu have a relatively good road network.\n\nIn addition to buses and taxis, Fiji also has a number of private transportation options, including car rentals and tours. Many tourists opt for these services, which can be more expensive but offer more flexibility and convenience. The country's transportation system is also influenced by its economy, with a GDP per capita PPP of $15,450 and an inflation rate of 4.5%, which can impact the cost of transportation. For example, the cost of fuel is around $1.20-$1.50 USD per liter, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.50 | $30-$50 | Good coverage in Suva and Nadi, less frequent in rural areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Fiji |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$3 | N/A | Common in rural areas, routes vary |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Fiji |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-$3 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Available in Suva and Nadi |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$5 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | ONO, Yaqona available in Suva and Nadi |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 |  |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.40 |  |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, depending on rental company and location |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in Suva and Nadi |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable in Fiji |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | From Suva to Nadi, depending on bus company and route |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | From Suva to Nadi, depending on airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Fiji |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using buses or minivans, which are often cheaper than taxis.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like ONO or Yaqona for convenient and affordable transportation in Suva and Nadi.\n- Always negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting your journey, especially for longer trips.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for flexibility and convenience, but be aware of the costs and driving conditions.\n- Use the **Fiji Bus** app to plan your bus route and track your journey in real-time.",
