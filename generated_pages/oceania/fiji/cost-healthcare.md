[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, but it is more affordable. For locals, the public system provides a range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic surgeries, often at little to no cost. However, foreigners and those seeking higher-quality care often opt for private facilities, which can be more expensive but offer better amenities and services. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can add up quickly.

The healthcare system in Fiji is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. The ministry operates a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country, offering a range of services, including maternal and child health, infectious disease control, and emergency medical services. However, the public system can be limited in terms of specialized care and advanced medical equipment, which is often only available in private facilities. As a result, those seeking specialized care or higher-quality services may need to seek treatment in private hospitals or clinics, which can be more expensive.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call 911 or 917 for an ambulance, which will take you to the nearest public hospital. However, if you are seeking private care, you may want to consider calling a private hospital or clinic directly to arrange for transportation. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private facilities, such as the Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva, which offers a range of services, including emergency care, surgical services, and specialized care. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuations, which can be arranged through your health insurance provider or a private emergency medical services company. 

In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to remain calm and seek help as quickly as possible. If you are in a rural area, you may need to travel to a larger town or city to access medical care, which can be time-consuming and costly. As a result, it is crucial to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including access to a reliable means of transportation and a way to communicate with medical professionals. Additionally, it is recommended to research local medical facilities and emergency services before traveling to Fiji, so you know what to expect in case of an emergency.
