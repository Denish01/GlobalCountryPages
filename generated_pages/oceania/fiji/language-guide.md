[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji's linguistic landscape is characterized by a mix of indigenous, colonial, and immigrant languages. The country has three official languages: English, Fijian, and Hindi. English is the most widely spoken language and is used as the primary language for government, education, and tourism. Fijian, also known as Na Vosa Vakaviti, is the indigenous language and is spoken by the majority of the population. Hindi is spoken by the Indo-Fijian community, which makes up a significant portion of the population. Regional dialects and minority languages are also present, with the Yasawa and Lau dialects being notable examples.

The Fijian language has several dialects, with the standard dialect being based on the Bau dialect. The language is a member of the Austronesian language family and is spoken by around 350,000 people. Hindi, on the other hand, is an Indo-European language and is spoken by around 250,000 people in Fiji. English is widely understood and is used as a **lingua franca** among people of different linguistic backgrounds. This means that tourists and visitors can easily communicate with locals, especially in urban areas and tourist destinations.

In addition to the official languages, there are several minority languages spoken in Fiji, including Rotuman and Kiribati. These languages are spoken by smaller communities and are not as widely spoken as the official languages. However, they are still an important part of Fiji's linguistic diversity and cultural heritage. Overall, Fiji's linguistic landscape is characterized by a rich diversity of languages and dialects, with English playing a key role in facilitating communication among people of different backgrounds.
