  "content": "Fiji's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and developing facilities, with significant investments in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 50%\nRoad Network: 3,440 km, moderate quality with some paved and many unpaved roads\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nFiji's infrastructure development level is moderately advanced, with a strong focus on tourism and agriculture. The government has invested heavily in recent years to upgrade the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy facilities. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The capital city, Suva, has a relatively well-developed infrastructure, while rural areas often lack access to these basic services. The Fijian government has recognized the need to address this gap and has implemented various initiatives to improve infrastructure in rural areas.\n\nThe country's infrastructure has been affected by natural disasters, such as cyclones and floods, which have damaged roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. To address this, the government has implemented disaster-risk reduction and management strategies, including the construction of flood-resistant roads and bridges. Fiji has also received significant funding from international organizations, such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, to support its infrastructure development plans.\n\nFiji's infrastructure development plans are aligned with the country's overall development strategy, which aims to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the living standards of its citizens. The government has identified key sectors, such as tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, as priority areas for investment and has developed strategies to support their growth. The development of infrastructure, such as roads, ports, and energy facilities, is critical to the growth of these sectors and the overall economy.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 3,440 km | Moderate | Many unpaved roads, particularly in rural areas |\n| Railways | none | - | - |\n| Airports | 4 international, 12 domestic | Good | Nadi International Airport is the main gateway |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Suva and Lautoka are the main ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Fiji's power generation is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a growing focus on **renewable energy** sources, such as hydro and solar power.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing its electricity access, with 99% of the population now having access to electricity.\n- However, the reliability of the electricity supply is still a concern, with frequent outages and load shedding during peak periods.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy, including the development of solar and wind power projects.\n- Fiji aims to increase its renewable energy share to 80% of its total energy mix by 2030, in line with its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but there are concerns about the quality of water in rural areas, where many communities rely on **rainwater harvesting** and **groundwater** sources.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- However, there are still significant challenges in rural areas, where many communities lack access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve water and sanitation services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sanitation facilities.\n- Fiji has also made progress in promoting **water conservation** and **efficient use** of water resources, particularly in the agriculture sector.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with all major operators offering 4G services in urban areas and 3G services in rural areas.\n- **Fiber optic** cables have been laid to connect the main islands, improving internet speeds and reliability.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to promote the use of **information and communication technology** (ICT) in various sectors, including education, healthcare, and commerce.\n- Fiji has a relatively well-developed **postal service**, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services across the country.\n- The country is also planning to roll out **5G services** in the near future, which is expected to further improve internet speeds and connectivity.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Fijian government has launched a **major road upgrade project**, which aims to improve the quality and safety of the country's road network.\n- The **Nadi Airport** is being upgraded to increase its capacity and improve facilities, with funding from the Asian Development Bank.\n- Fiji is also investing in **renewable energy** projects, including solar and wind power, to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and promote sustainable energy.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **water and sanitation** services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sanitation facilities.\n- The **Fiji National Development Plan** outlines the country's development priorities, including infrastructure development, and provides a framework for implementing these plans.",
