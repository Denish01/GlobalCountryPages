The cost of living in Fiji is also influenced by the country's growing tourism industry, which drives up prices for accommodations, food, and other services. However, eating out in Fiji can be relatively affordable, especially if you opt for local cuisine and street food. The Fijian diet is rich in fresh seafood, fruits, and vegetables, which are readily available and relatively inexpensive. On the other hand, imported goods and luxury items can be quite pricey.\n\nThe country's food prices are also affected by seasonal fluctuations, with prices tend to be higher during peak tourist season (June to September). Additionally, the Fijian government's efforts to promote local agriculture and reduce reliance on imports have led to an increase in the production and consumption of local produce, which has helped to stabilize food prices. Overall, Fiji offers a unique and affordable dining experience, with a mix of traditional Fijian cuisine, Indian, Chinese, and European influences. Whether you're looking for a quick snack or a fine dining experience, Fiji has something to offer for every budget and taste.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2-$3 | 4-6 FJD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1-$2 | 2-4 FJD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-$3 | 4-6 FJD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 2-4 FJD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6-$8 | 12-16 FJD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10-$12 | 20-24 FJD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-$6 | 10-12 FJD | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 4-6 FJD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 2-4 FJD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 2-4 FJD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8-$10 | 16-20 FJD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-$2 | 2-4 FJD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like **kokoda**, **lovo**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person, **Fijian curry**, **fish and chips**) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$50 | (3 courses, **seafood**, **steak**) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, **gourmet** cuisine) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Fiji offers a range of options, from modern supermarkets to traditional local markets. Supermarkets like **MHCC** and **New World** offer a wide selection of products, including imported goods, but tend to be pricier than local markets. On the other hand, local markets like the **Suva Municipal Market** and **Nadi Market** offer fresh produce, meats, and other staples at lower prices. However, the quality and variety of products may vary, and bargaining is often expected. It's best to buy fresh produce, meats, and seafood at local markets, while opting for supermarkets for imported goods and other essentials.\n\nIn general, local markets offer better value for money, especially for fresh produce and traditional Fijian ingredients. However, supermarkets are more convenient and offer a wider range of products, including organic and specialty items. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to bargain and negotiate prices, as this is a common practice in Fijian culture. Additionally, be sure to check the quality and freshness of products before purchasing, as some items may be past their expiration dates or of poor quality.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries and street food stalls is a great way to experience Fijian cuisine and save money.\n- **Kokoda**, a traditional Fijian dish made with raw fish, coconut milk, and spices, is a must-try and relatively inexpensive.\n- Fresh seafood, fruits, and vegetables are abundant and affordable in Fiji, making them great options for meals and snacks.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, especially luxury items, as they can be very pricey.\n- **Lovo**, a traditional Fijian feast, is a great way to experience local cuisine and culture, and can be relatively affordable if you opt for a local restaurant or community event.\n- When shopping at local markets, be sure to bargain and negotiate prices, and always check the quality and freshness of products before purchasing.",
