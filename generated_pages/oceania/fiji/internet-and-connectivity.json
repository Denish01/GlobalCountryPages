  "content": "The internet in Fiji is relatively well-developed, with good mobile network coverage and widespread WiFi availability, making it easy for tourists and remote workers to stay connected during their stay. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 10 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Good\nMain Carriers: Vodafone, Digicel, Inkk Mobile\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Widespread\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nFiji's internet quality is generally good, with average download speeds of 10 Mbps, allowing for smooth browsing, social media, and video streaming. However, there is a notable urban vs rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in urban areas like Suva and Nadi, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in Fiji is also affected by the weather, with heavy rainfall and cyclones potentially causing disruptions to services.\n\nThe Fijian government has been investing in the development of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, including the rollout of fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of mobile networks. This has led to improvements in internet speeds and coverage, particularly in urban areas. However, more needs to be done to address the rural-urban divide and ensure that all areas of the country have access to reliable and fast internet services.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Fiji is relatively easy, with several mobile carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. The two main carriers, Vodafone and Digicel, have outlets at Nadi International Airport and in major towns, where you can purchase a SIM card with a valid passport and proof of address. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and data plans start from around 5 USD for 1 GB of data. Recommended carriers include Vodafone, Digicel, and Inkk Mobile, which offer a range of plans to suit different needs and budgets.\n\nIt's worth noting that some carriers may require you to register your SIM card, which can be done at the point of purchase or online. This is a straightforward process that requires you to provide some personal details and proof of identity. Once you have purchased and registered your SIM card, you can top up your account with credit, which can be done at outlets across the country or online.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vodafone | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Digicel | Visitor Plan | 2 GB | 10 | Valid for 14 days |\n| Inkk Mobile | Data Plan | 5 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Vodafone | Premium Plan | 10 GB | 30 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many resorts and hotels offering free WiFi to guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is well-established in Fiji, with many cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are available in major towns, offering fast and reliable WiFi, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and printing services\n- Public WiFi is available in some areas, including airports and public libraries, but can be slow and unreliable\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi, making it easy to stay connected while dining out\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like The Hive in Suva and the Fiji Coworking Space in Nadi offer fast and reliable WiFi, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and printing services\n- Reliable cafe chains like The Coffee Club and Cafe 30 offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and satellite internet are available, but can be expensive and slow\n- VPNs are recommended to ensure secure and private browsing, particularly when using public WiFi\n- Some hotels and resorts also offer coworking spaces and meeting rooms, making them a good option for remote workers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major issue in Fiji, but some websites may be blocked due to copyright or other restrictions\n- [CALLOUT] Be aware of your data usage, as roaming charges can be high and data plans can be expensive\n- VPNs are recommended to ensure secure and private browsing, particularly when using public WiFi\n- Roaming alternatives like local SIM cards and mobile hotspots can be more cost-effective than roaming with your home carrier\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Fiji, so it's best to purchase a physical SIM card\n- Be cautious when using public WiFi, as it can be slow and unreliable, and may not be secure\n- [RATING] Internet quality: 4/5, with good speeds and coverage in urban areas, but slower speeds and more frequent outages in rural areas.",
