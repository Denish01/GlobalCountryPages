# Best Time to Visit Fiji — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Fiji is from July to September, when the weather is dry and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities and island hopping. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Fiji: July to September. Peak season: June to October. Budget season: November to April. Avoid: January to March and December due to the wet season and cyclone risks. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji has a tropical marine climate, with two distinct seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by low humidity, plenty of sunshine, and gentle breezes. This is the best time to visit Fiji, as the weather is perfect for snorkeling, diving, and exploring the islands. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by high humidity, heavy rainfall, and a higher risk of cyclones. During this time, some tourist facilities may be closed, and travel can be more challenging.

The climate in Fiji varies depending on the region, with the western islands tend to be drier than the eastern islands. The mountainous regions of the main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, are generally cooler than the coastal areas. The dry season is the peak tourist season, with the highest prices and largest crowds. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with lower prices and fewer tourists.

Fiji's seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time for outdoor activities, such as hiking, birdwatching, and water sports. The wet season, while not ideal for outdoor activities, is a great time to see the islands' lush vegetation and waterfalls in full bloom. Additionally, the wet season is a good time to spot marine life, such as whales and dolphins, which migrate to Fijian waters during this time.
