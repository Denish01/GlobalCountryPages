# Fiji Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Fiji's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and developing facilities, with significant investments in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 99% of population
Internet Penetration: 50%
Road Network: 3,440 km, moderate quality with some paved and many unpaved roads
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji's infrastructure development level is moderately advanced, with a strong focus on tourism and agriculture. The government has invested heavily in recent years to upgrade the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy facilities. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The capital city, Suva, has a relatively well-developed infrastructure, while rural areas often lack access to these basic services. The Fijian government has recognized the need to address this gap and has implemented various initiatives to improve infrastructure in rural areas.

The country's infrastructure has been affected by natural disasters, such as cyclones and floods, which have damaged roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. To address this, the government has implemented disaster-risk reduction and management strategies, including the construction of flood-resistant roads and bridges. Fiji has also received significant funding from international organizations, such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, to support its infrastructure development plans.

Fiji's infrastructure development plans are aligned with the country's overall development strategy, which aims to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the living standards of its citizens. The government has identified key sectors, such as tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, as priority areas for investment and has developed strategies to support their growth. The development of infrastructure, such as roads, ports, and energy facilities, is critical to the growth of these sectors and the overall economy.
