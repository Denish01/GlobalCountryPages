  "content": "Fiji is generally cheaper than Tonga, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nFiji GDP per Capita (PPP): $9,850\nTonga GDP per Capita (PPP): $6,380\nFiji Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nTonga Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Fiji\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Fiji vs Tonga [/SECTION]\nFiji and Tonga are two island nations in the Pacific Ocean, known for their beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and rich cultural heritage. When it comes to the cost of living, Fiji is generally considered to be the more affordable option. The country has a more developed economy and a larger population, which has led to a more competitive market and lower prices for goods and services. Tonga, on the other hand, is a smaller and more isolated country, with a higher cost of living due to its limited resources and reliance on imports.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Fiji has a more diversified economy, with a strong tourism industry, agriculture, and manufacturing sector. Tonga, on the other hand, has a smaller and more limited economy, with a greater reliance on foreign aid and remittances. As a result, Fiji is generally able to offer lower prices for goods and services, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees. However, Tonga has a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, which may appeal to those looking for a slower pace of life.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Fiji (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $550 | 27% more expensive in Tonga |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $250 | $350 | 29% more expensive in Tonga |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $700 | $900 | 22% more expensive in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Fiji (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $10 | $15 | 33% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $300 | $400 | 25% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Beer (500ml) | $3 | $4 | 25% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Coffee | $2 | $3 | 33% more expensive in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Fiji (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 40% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1 | $1.50 | 33% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1.50 | 20% more expensive in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Fiji (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $100 | $150 | 33% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $30 | $40 | 25% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $15 | 33% more expensive in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Fiji (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $800 | $1,100 | 27% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Mid-Range | $1,200 | $1,600 | 25% more expensive in Tonga |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $2,500 | 20% more expensive in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Fiji is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices that are 20-30% lower than in Tonga\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices that are 25-35% lower than in Tonga\n  - Transportation, with fuel prices that are 15-20% lower than in Tonga\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices that are 20-30% lower than in Tonga\n- **Tonga is cheaper for:**\n  - Some imported goods, such as electronics and clothing, which may be 10-20% cheaper than in Fiji\n  - Certain types of accommodation, such as guesthouses and homestays, which may be 10-20% cheaper than in Fiji\n  - Some tourist activities, such as snorkeling and diving, which may be 10-20% cheaper than in Fiji\n  - Traditional Tongan goods and services, such as handicrafts and local tours, which may be 10-20% cheaper than in Fiji\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFiji and Tonga are both great options for those looking to live or visit the Pacific Islands.
