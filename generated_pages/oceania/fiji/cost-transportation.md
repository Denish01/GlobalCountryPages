[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with buses and taxis being the most common modes of public transportation. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Suva and Nadi having more frequent and reliable services. Most people in Fiji get around using buses, which are an affordable and convenient option, or by using taxis, which are readily available in urban areas. The country's geography, with many islands and rugged terrain, can make transportation challenging, but the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu have a relatively good road network.

In addition to buses and taxis, Fiji also has a number of private transportation options, including car rentals and tours. Many tourists opt for these services, which can be more expensive but offer more flexibility and convenience. The country's transportation system is also influenced by its economy, with a GDP per capita PPP of $15,450 and an inflation rate of 4.5%, which can impact the cost of transportation. For example, the cost of fuel is around $1.20-$1.50 USD per liter, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.
