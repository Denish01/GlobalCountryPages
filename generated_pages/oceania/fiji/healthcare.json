  "content": "Healthcare in Fiji is a mixed system that provides both public and private services, with varying levels of quality and accessibility across the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 911\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nFiji's healthcare system is structured to provide universal access to healthcare services, with both public and private providers playing a crucial role. The public healthcare system is managed by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, which operates hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country. The quality of care in public facilities can vary, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed hospitals than rural areas. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality services, but at a higher cost. The majority of the population relies on public healthcare services, while those who can afford it opt for private care.\n\nThe quality of care in Fiji is generally good, with many healthcare professionals having received training in countries such as Australia and New Zealand. However, there are still challenges related to access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas where facilities and personnel may be limited. Urban areas, such as Suva and Nadi, have better access to healthcare services, including specialized care and advanced medical equipment.\n\nDespite these challenges, Fiji has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on preventive care, health promotion, and disease control. The government has also implemented initiatives to increase access to healthcare services, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, women, and the elderly.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Colonial War Memorial Hospital | Suva | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Lautoka Hospital | Lautoka | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Nadi Hospital | Nadi | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Yes |\n| Pacific Private Hospital | Suva | Private | Cardiology, oncology, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Fiji Private Hospital | Nadi | Private | General medicine, surgery, dental care | Yes |\n| Ba Hospital | Ba | Public | General medicine, surgery, maternity care | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expats, as it provides access to higher-quality private healthcare services.\n- Local insurance options are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended, as it can provide coverage for emergency medical evacuations and other unexpected medical expenses.\n- Expats and foreigners can purchase private health insurance plans from local or international providers, with costs varying depending on the level of coverage and age of the individual.\n- **Group health insurance** plans are also available for companies and organizations, providing coverage for employees and their dependents.\n- It is essential to carefully review and compare different insurance plans to ensure that they meet your specific needs and budget.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are widely available in urban areas, with many pharmacies and drug stores located in Suva and other major towns.\n- Prescription requirements vary depending on the type of medication, with some medications available over-the-counter and others requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- Common brands of medications are available, including international brands and local generics.\n- The cost of medications can vary, with some medications being relatively expensive, particularly in private pharmacies.\n- It is essential to ensure that any medications purchased are from reputable sources and are not counterfeit or expired.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Fiji, as these diseases are prevalent in the country.\n- **Hepatitis B** and **rabies** vaccinations are also recommended for certain individuals, such as healthcare workers and those who will be spending time in rural areas.\n- Fiji is at risk for **dengue fever**, **zika**, and **chikungunya**, and visitors should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, with some areas having contaminated water supplies, and visitors should drink bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, with some foods being contaminated with bacteria or other pathogens, and visitors should eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and seafood.\n- It is essential to take precautions to prevent **sunburn** and **heat stroke**, particularly during outdoor activities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Fiji is not a major destination for medical tourism, but some private hospitals and clinics offer specialized services such as **dental care** and **cosmetic surgery**.\n- The **Pacific Private Hospital** in Suva is a popular destination for medical tourists, offering a range of services including cardiology and orthopedics.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with some procedures costing up to 50% less than in countries such as Australia and New Zealand.\n- However, it is essential to carefully research and evaluate the quality and safety of any medical facility before seeking treatment.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a medical emergency, call **911** or visit the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance services** are available in urban areas, but may not be reliable in rural areas.\n- It is essential to have a **first aid kit** and know basic first aid techniques, particularly when traveling to remote areas.\n- In the event of a serious medical emergency, **medical evacuation** to a nearby country such as Australia or New Zealand may be necessary.\n- It is essential to have **travel insurance** that covers emergency medical evacuations and other unexpected medical expenses.",
