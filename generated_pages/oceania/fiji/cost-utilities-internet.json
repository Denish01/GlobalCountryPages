  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Fiji can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($50 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: FJD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nFiji's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and telecommunications services. However, the costs of these services can fluctuate due to factors such as fuel prices, seasonal demand, and government subsidies. For example, electricity costs can increase during the summer months when air conditioning usage is higher. Additionally, the Fijian government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, such as subsidies for low-income households and investments in renewable energy sources.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Fiji is generally good, with a high level of access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there can be occasional disruptions to services, particularly during natural disasters such as cyclones. The cost of utilities can also vary depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have higher costs than rural areas. Overall, the cost of utilities in Fiji is relatively stable, but it's essential to factor in seasonal variations and potential fluctuations in the cost of fuel and other factors.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (bottled gas) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in municipal rates) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | Vodafone, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 50-100 Mbps | Vodafone, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Vodafone, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Vodafone, Digicel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Vodafone, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Fiji TV) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Fiji, it's recommended to contact the relevant providers (e.g. Vodafone, Digicel, Fiji Electricity Authority) and provide proof of identity and address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available for households that want to manage their energy usage and costs more effectively.\n- The best internet providers in Fiji are Vodafone and Digicel, which offer a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using **rainwater harvesting** systems to reduce water consumption.\n- It's also a good idea to regularly review and compare utility plans and prices to ensure that you're getting the best value for your money.",
