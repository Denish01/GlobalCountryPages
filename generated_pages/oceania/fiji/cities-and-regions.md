[SECTION] How Fiji Is Divided [/SECTION]
Fiji is divided into four administrative divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. These divisions are further divided into provinces, which are governed by the provincial councils. The divisions are based on geographical and cultural differences, with each division having its own unique characteristics and attractions. The capital city, Suva, is located in the Central Division and serves as the country's economic and cultural hub.

The administrative structure of Fiji is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of government services and to promote local governance. The divisions and provinces work together to provide services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. The system also allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, enabling communities to make decisions that are tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.
