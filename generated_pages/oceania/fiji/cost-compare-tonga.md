[SECTION] Overview: Fiji vs Tonga [/SECTION]
Fiji and Tonga are two island nations in the Pacific Ocean, known for their beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and rich cultural heritage. When it comes to the cost of living, Fiji is generally considered to be the more affordable option. The country has a more developed economy and a larger population, which has led to a more competitive market and lower prices for goods and services. Tonga, on the other hand, is a smaller and more isolated country, with a higher cost of living due to its limited resources and reliance on imports.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Fiji has a more diversified economy, with a strong tourism industry, agriculture, and manufacturing sector. Tonga, on the other hand, has a smaller and more limited economy, with a greater reliance on foreign aid and remittances. As a result, Fiji is generally able to offer lower prices for goods and services, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees. However, Tonga has a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, which may appeal to those looking for a slower pace of life.
