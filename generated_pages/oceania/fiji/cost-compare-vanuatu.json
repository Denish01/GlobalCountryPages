  "content": "Fiji is generally cheaper than Vanuatu, with an overall cost of living that is around 10-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nFiji GDP per Capita (PPP): 9,850\nVanuatu GDP per Capita (PPP): 7,960\nFiji Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nVanuatu Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Fiji\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Fiji vs Vanuatu [/SECTION]\nFiji and Vanuatu are two island nations in the Pacific, known for their stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly people. When it comes to the cost of living, Fiji is generally considered to be the more affordable option. Fiji's economy is more developed, with a stronger tourism industry and a more diverse range of industries, which has helped to keep prices lower. In contrast, Vanuatu's economy is more reliant on agriculture and fishing, which can make it more vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. As a result, Fiji is often the better choice for expats, students, and retirees who are looking for a more affordable Pacific island lifestyle.\n\nThe cost of living in Fiji is around 10-20% lower than in Vanuatu, depending on the specific items and services being compared. This is due to a range of factors, including lower housing costs, cheaper food and transportation, and more competitive pricing for utilities and internet services. However, it's worth noting that Vanuatu has a more relaxed and laid-back atmosphere, which can make it an attractive option for those who prioritize lifestyle over cost. Overall, Fiji is the better choice for those who are looking for a more affordable Pacific island lifestyle, while Vanuatu is better suited to those who prioritize relaxation and a slower pace of life.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Fiji (USD) | Vanuatu (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 550 | 27% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 350 | 29% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 1,100 | 27% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Fiji (USD) | Vanuatu (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 400 | 25% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 4 | 25% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Fiji (USD) | Vanuatu (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 1.5 | 33% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1.5 | 20% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Fiji (USD) | Vanuatu (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 33% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Vanuatu |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Fiji (USD) | Vanuatu (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1,200 | 33% cheaper in Fiji |\n| Mid-Range | 1,500 | 2,500 | 40% cheaper in Fiji |\n| Comfortable | 3,000 | 4,500 | 33% cheaper in Fiji |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Fiji is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices around 25-30% lower than in Vanuatu\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices around 30-40% lower than in Vanuatu\n  - Transportation, with taxi and fuel prices around 20-30% lower than in Vanuatu\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices around 25-40% lower than in Vanuatu\n- **Vanuatu is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain types of fresh produce, which can be around 10-20% cheaper than in Fiji\n  - Local handicrafts and souvenirs, which can be around 10-20% cheaper than in Fiji\n  - Certain types of accommodation, such as guesthouses and hostels, which can be around 10-20% cheaper than in Fiji\n  - Scuba diving and snorkeling trips, which can be around 10-20% cheaper than in Fiji\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees who are looking for a more affordable Pacific island lifestyle, Fiji is generally the better choice.
