The population growth rate is approximately 0.7%, which is relatively low compared to other developing countries. The urban population accounts for about 55% of the total population, with the majority living in the capital city of Suva and other major towns. Fiji has a relatively high life expectancy of 73 years, and the fertility rate is 2.5 children per woman, which is slightly above the replacement rate. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 28 years.\n\nIn terms of population trends, Fiji has experienced a significant shift from rural to urban areas, with many people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities. This has led to the growth of cities such as Suva, Nadi, and Lautoka, which are now major hubs for commerce, education, and healthcare. However, this urbanization trend has also put pressure on the country's infrastructure and services, particularly in terms of housing, transportation, and healthcare.\n\nFiji's population is also influenced by migration patterns, with many Fijians living and working abroad, particularly in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. This has led to a significant diaspora community, with many Fijians maintaining strong ties to their homeland while also contributing to the economy and culture of their adopted countries.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Indigenous Fijians | 56% | Rural and urban areas | Native to Fiji, with a strong cultural identity |\n| Indo-Fijians | 38% | Urban and rural areas | Descendants of Indian indentured laborers, with a distinct cultural identity |\n| Rotumans | 1.2% | Rotuma Island | A distinct ethnic group with their own language and culture |\n| Chinese | 1.5% | Urban areas | Descendants of Chinese immigrants, with a significant presence in trade and commerce |\n| Europeans | 0.5% | Urban areas | Descendants of European settlers, with a significant presence in business and government |\n| Other Pacific Islanders | 2.5% | Urban and rural areas | Includes people from other Pacific Island countries, such as Tonga and Vanuatu |\n[/TABLE]\nFiji's ethnic diversity is a significant aspect of its cultural identity, with a mix of indigenous Fijians, Indo-Fijians, and other ethnic groups.
