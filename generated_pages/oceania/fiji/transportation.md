[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Fiji is easily accessible by air, with two main international airports: Nadi International Airport and Nausori International Airport, which is located near the capital city of Suva. Nadi International Airport is the primary entry point for most visitors, with direct flights from major hubs such as Los Angeles, Sydney, and Auckland. You can also fly into Fiji from other Pacific Island nations, such as Tonga and Vanuatu. There are no overland entry points to Fiji, as it is an island nation.

If you're traveling from within the Pacific region, you can also take a ferry or a cruise ship to Fiji. However, this option is less common and typically takes longer than flying. Fiji's main ports are located in Suva, Lautoka, and Levuka, and they receive cargo ships and cruise liners from around the world. To get to Fiji, you can also consider flying into a nearby country, such as New Zealand or Australia, and then taking a connecting flight to Fiji.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Fiji has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between the main islands. The main domestic airlines are Fiji Airways, Northern Air, and Pacific Island Air. They operate flights from Nadi International Airport and Nausori International Airport to other islands, such as Taveuni, Kadavu, and the Mamanuca and Yasawa island groups. You can book domestic flights online or through a local travel agent, and approximate costs range from $100 to $300 USD per person for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and airline.

When booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to book in advance to secure the best rates, especially during peak travel seasons. You can also consider booking a package deal that includes accommodation and activities, which can be a convenient and cost-effective option. Additionally, some airlines offer special discounts for residents, students, and seniors, so it's worth checking with the airline to see if you're eligible for any discounts.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Fiji does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. However, there are plans to develop a railway system in the future, which would connect the main cities and towns. For now, you'll need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around the islands.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Fiji has a moderate network of buses and coaches that operate on the main islands. The main bus companies are Pacific Transport, Coral Sun, and Sunbeam Transport, and they offer routes between the major towns and cities. Bus fares are relatively affordable, with prices starting from around $1 to $5 USD per trip, depending on the route and distance. You can pay the driver directly when you board the bus, and it's a good idea to have small bills and coins handy.
