[SECTION] Overview: Fiji vs Vanuatu [/SECTION]
Fiji and Vanuatu are two island nations in the Pacific, known for their stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly people.

Fiji's economy is more developed, with a stronger tourism industry and a more diverse range of industries, which has helped to keep prices lower.

The cost of living in Fiji is around 10-20% lower than in Vanuatu, depending on the specific items and services being compared. This is due to a range of factors, including lower housing costs, cheaper food and transportation, and more competitive pricing for utilities and internet services. However, it's worth noting that Vanuatu has a more relaxed and laid-back atmosphere, which can make it an attractive option for those who prioritize lifestyle over cost. Overall, Fiji is the better choice for those who are looking for a more affordable Pacific island lifestyle, while Vanuatu is better suited to those who prioritize relaxation and a slower pace of life.
