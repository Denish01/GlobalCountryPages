[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji has a **territorial taxation** system, meaning that individuals and companies are only taxed on their Fiji-sourced income. However, **worldwide taxation** applies to residents, who are taxed on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. To be considered a tax resident in Fiji, an individual must have been present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year, or have a permanent home in Fiji and be present in the country for at least 30 days in a calendar year.

The tax system in Fiji is relatively straightforward, with a focus on simplicity and ease of compliance. The Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) is responsible for administering the tax system, including collecting taxes, providing taxpayer services, and enforcing tax laws. Taxpayers can register for a tax identification number (TIN) online or through a tax agent, and are required to file tax returns annually.
