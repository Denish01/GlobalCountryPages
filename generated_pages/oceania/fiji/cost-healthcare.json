  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Fiji can vary significantly depending on whether you opt for public or private services, with public healthcare being generally more affordable but often limited in terms of quality and availability, while private healthcare offers better facilities and services at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $213\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 8.3%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911 or 917\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: FJD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nFiji's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, but it is more affordable. For locals, the public system provides a range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic surgeries, often at little to no cost. However, foreigners and those seeking higher-quality care often opt for private facilities, which can be more expensive but offer better amenities and services. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can add up quickly.\n\nThe healthcare system in Fiji is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. The ministry operates a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country, offering a range of services, including maternal and child health, infectious disease control, and emergency medical services. However, the public system can be limited in terms of specialized care and advanced medical equipment, which is often only available in private facilities. As a result, those seeking specialized care or higher-quality services may need to seek treatment in private hospitals or clinics, which can be more expensive.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics often have long wait times, while private clinics offer more personalized care |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Specialist care is often only available in private facilities |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics offer more advanced services, such as orthodontics and cosmetic dentistry |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Private optometrists often have more advanced equipment and a wider range of services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs often offer faster turnaround times and more comprehensive testing options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals often have longer wait times and more basic facilities |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations and better amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals often have more advanced equipment and more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals offer more personalized care and better amenities for new mothers |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private hospitals often have more advanced imaging equipment and faster turnaround times |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Public hospitals often have more basic equipment and longer wait times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays, but often has limited coverage for specialized care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers a wider range of services, including specialist care and advanced medical procedures, often with higher coverage limits |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers a full range of medical services, including emergency evacuations and repatriations, often with worldwide coverage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, are widely available in pharmacies and often cost between $5-$20 per prescription\n- Prescription rules vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter or with a simple prescription from a doctor\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but can be limited in rural areas\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as cold and flu remedies, are often priced similarly to those in other countries, around $10-$30 per packet\n- Some medications, such as those for chronic conditions, may require a prescription from a specialist and can be more expensive, often costing $50-$100 per month\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary medications with you when traveling to Fiji, as availability and pricing can vary\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call 911 or 917 for an ambulance, which will take you to the nearest public hospital. However, if you are seeking private care, you may want to consider calling a private hospital or clinic directly to arrange for transportation. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private facilities, such as the Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva, which offers a range of services, including emergency care, surgical services, and specialized care. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuations, which can be arranged through your health insurance provider or a private emergency medical services company. \n\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to remain calm and seek help as quickly as possible. If you are in a rural area, you may need to travel to a larger town or city to access medical care, which can be time-consuming and costly. As a result, it is crucial to have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including access to a reliable means of transportation and a way to communicate with medical professionals. Additionally, it is recommended to research local medical facilities and emergency services before traveling to Fiji, so you know what to expect in case of an emergency.",
