An invitation letter from a Fijian company and proof of sufficient funds are typically required. **Students:** Students require a pre-arranged visa and must provide proof of enrollment at a Fijian educational institution. The duration of the visa is typically tied to the length of the course of study. **Workers:** Workers require a pre-arranged visa and must have a job offer from a Fijian employer.
