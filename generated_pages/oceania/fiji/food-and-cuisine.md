[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Fiji's cuisine is a reflection of its cultural diversity, with influences from its indigenous Melanesian people, as well as Indian, Chinese, and European settlers. The traditional Fijian diet consists of fresh seafood, root vegetables, and coconuts, while Indian and Chinese cuisine has introduced a wide range of spices, vegetables, and cooking techniques. Regional variations are also evident, with the eastern islands having a stronger Polynesian influence and the western islands having a more Indian-influenced cuisine. As a result, Fijian cuisine is a unique and flavorful blend of different cultures and traditions.

Fijian cuisine is also known for its use of **lovo**, a traditional underground oven, which is used to cook a variety of dishes, including meat, fish, and vegetables. The lovo is a central part of Fijian culture and is often used for special occasions and celebrations. In addition to lovo, Fijian cuisine also makes use of **coconut milk**, which is a staple ingredient in many dishes, including curries, soups, and desserts.

The Fijian diet is also influenced by its tropical climate, with a wide range of fresh fruits and vegetables available throughout the year. Popular fruits include **mangoes**, **pineapples**, and **papayas**, while popular vegetables include **taro**, **yams**, and **cassava**. With its unique blend of cultural influences and fresh, local ingredients, Fijian cuisine is a must-try when visiting the islands.
