  "content": "[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]\nFiji's culture is a unique blend of indigenous Fijian, European, Indian, and Chinese influences. The country's strategic location in the Pacific has made it a crossroads for various cultures, resulting in a distinct cultural identity. The indigenous Fijian people, known as the iTaukei, make up around 56% of the population, while people of Indian descent account for around 37%. The remaining population consists of Europeans, Chinese, and other Pacific Islanders. The official languages of Fiji are English, Fijian, and Hindi, reflecting the country's diverse cultural makeup.\n\nThe iTaukei people have a rich cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on community, respect for tradition, and a deep connection to the land and sea. Their culture is characterized by a complex system of chiefs and clans, with a strong focus on ceremonial and ritual practices. The influence of European colonization and Indian immigration has also had a significant impact on Fijian culture, with the introduction of new customs, languages, and traditions. Today, Fiji is a multicultural society, with a vibrant and dynamic cultural scene that reflects its diverse history and influences.\n\nFiji's cultural identity is also shaped by its geographic location and natural environment. The country's tropical islands, coral reefs, and lush forests have inspired a deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors. Many Fijians live in rural areas, where traditional practices such as fishing, farming, and craftsmanship are still an integral part of daily life. The country's cultural identity is also reflected in its music, dance, and art, which often feature traditional instruments, costumes, and motifs.\n\n[SECTION] Food & Cuisine [/SECTION]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Must-Try? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kokoda | Appetizer | Raw fish marinated in coconut milk and lime juice | Yes |\n| Lovo | Main Course | Meat and vegetables cooked in an underground oven | Yes |\n| Palusami | Side Dish | Steamed taro leaves filled with coconut cream and onions | Yes |\n| Vakalolo | Dessert | Traditional Fijian donuts made with coconut milk and sugar | Yes |\n| Duruka | Side Dish | Boiled or roasted tropical plant with a sweet and nutty flavor | No |\n| Wahoo | Main Course | Grilled or fried fish often served with a side of coconut rice | Yes |\n| Kava | Beverage | Traditional Fijian drink made from the roots of the kava plant | Yes |\n| Coconut Water | Beverage | Fresh and refreshing drink made from young coconuts | Yes |\n\nFijian cuisine is a fusion of traditional and international flavors, with a strong emphasis on fresh seafood, coconut milk, and tropical fruits.
