# Best Time to Visit Tonga — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Tonga is during the dry season, from May to October, when the weather is warm and sunny, with minimal rainfall and low humidity. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Tonga: May to October. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: November to April. Avoid: February to April due to the wet season and potential cyclones. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Tonga has a tropical marine climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, from May to October, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C. This period is ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and whale watching. The wet season, from November to April, is marked by increased rainfall and higher humidity, with a higher risk of cyclones. During this time, some tourist facilities and attractions may be closed, and travel can be more challenging.

The climate in Tonga is influenced by its location in the Pacific Ocean, with the trade winds and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) playing a significant role in shaping the country's weather patterns. The ITCZ, a belt of low-pressure systems near the equator, brings warm and moist air to the region, resulting in increased rainfall during the wet season. The trade winds, on the other hand, bring cooler and drier air from the southeast, contributing to the dry season's pleasant weather.

Tonga's geography also affects the climate, with the island's elevation and topography influencing the distribution of rainfall and temperature. The higher elevations on the islands of Tongatapu and Vava'u tend to be cooler and more humid than the coastal areas, while the low-lying areas are more prone to flooding during heavy rainfall events.
