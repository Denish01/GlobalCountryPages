[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Tonga is dominated by the **Tongan language**, which is a member of the Polynesian language family. Tongan is the first language of the vast majority of the population, and it is the primary language used in government, education, and daily life. English, on the other hand, is widely used as a second language, particularly in business, tourism, and education. Many Tongans speak English as a second language, and it is commonly used in official contexts, such as government and education. There are also some regional dialects of Tongan, but they are generally mutually intelligible.

Tongan is a **verb-based language**, which means that the verb is the central component of a sentence. It is also a highly **context-dependent language**, which means that the meaning of a sentence can depend on the context in which it is spoken. For example, the same word can have different meanings depending on the tone and pitch used to pronounce it. English is widely understood in Tonga, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. However, it is still a good idea to learn some basic **Tongan phrases**, such as greetings and expressions of gratitude, to show respect for the local culture.

The use of English in Tonga is **widespread**, particularly in urban areas such as **Nukualofa**, the capital city. Many signs, menus, and official documents are written in both Tongan and English, making it relatively easy for English-speaking tourists to navigate the country. However, it is still a good idea to learn some basic Tongan phrases, such as greetings and expressions of gratitude, to show respect for the local culture. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Tonga is characterized by a mix of Tongan and English, with Tongan being the dominant language and English being widely used as a second language.
