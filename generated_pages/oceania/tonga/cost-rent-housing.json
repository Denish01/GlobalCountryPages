Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under the Tongan **Fair Rent Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Fiji and Samoa, Tonga's housing costs are relatively moderate, with rent prices slightly lower than in Fiji but higher than in Samoa.\n\nThe housing market in Tonga is also influenced by the country's **tourism industry**, with many properties being used as holiday rentals or guesthouses. This can lead to a shortage of long-term rentals, particularly during peak tourist season. However, for those willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available in the suburbs and rural areas. With a **GDP per capita** of $7,803, Tonga has a relatively high standard of living, which can contribute to higher housing costs.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | fully furnished, with kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $300-$500 | suitable for families, with additional amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $450-$700 | spacious, with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, close to amenities and services |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, with easy access to city center |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | scenic areas, with limited access to amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Kolomotu'a**: a popular neighborhood for expats, with a range of housing options and amenities, rent range $300-$500 per month\n- **Ma'ufanga**: a coastal neighborhood with stunning views, rent range $400-$700 per month\n- **Nukunuku**: a suburban neighborhood with a mix of housing options, rent range $200-$400 per month\n- **Pangai**: a central neighborhood with easy access to amenities, rent range $350-$600 per month\n- **Sopu**: a rural neighborhood with scenic views, rent range $150-$300 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Tonga [/SECTION]\n- Research thoroughly: look for properties online, and ask around for recommendations\n- Inspect the property: before signing a lease, make sure to inspect the property for any damage or needed repairs\n- Negotiate the rent: it's common to negotiate the rent, especially for longer-term leases\n- Understand the lease: make sure to read and understand the lease agreement before signing\n- Consider furnished options: many properties in Tonga come furnished, which can be convenient for expats\n- Be prepared for **out-of-pocket expenses**: some utilities, such as electricity and water, may not be included in the rent.
