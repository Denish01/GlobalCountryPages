  "content": "The cost of education in Tonga varies depending on the type of institution and the level of education, with public schools generally being free or subsidized, while private and international schools can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 5.3%\nLiteracy Rate: 99%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 12 months\nCurrency: TOP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Tonga is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for ensuring that all children have access to quality education. The country has a relatively high literacy rate, with approximately 99% of the population able to read and write. The language of instruction is primarily **Tongan**, although **English** is also widely used, particularly in secondary and tertiary education. Compulsory education in Tonga lasts for 6 years, from ages 5 to 11, and is generally provided free of charge by the government. However, the quality of public education can vary, and some parents may choose to send their children to private schools, which can offer a higher level of education and better facilities.\n\nIn terms of international schools, there are a limited number of options available in Tonga, primarily catering to the children of expatriates and wealthy locals. These schools often follow international curricula, such as the **International Baccalaureate** or **Cambridge International Examinations**, and can provide a high-quality education that is recognized globally. However, the cost of attending an international school in Tonga can be prohibitively expensive for many families, with annual fees ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 or more.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Generally good quality, but facilities may be limited |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to excellent |\n| Public Secondary | $100-$500 (subsidized) | Quality can vary, with some schools offering better facilities and teaching |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Generally higher quality than public schools, with better facilities and teaching |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | High-quality education, international curricula, and excellent facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Limited options, but generally affordable |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Higher quality, but more expensive |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$6,000 | $6,000-$12,000 | **University of the South Pacific** has a campus in Tonga, offering high-quality education |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited options, but generally affordable |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Can be expensive, but may be necessary for some students |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | **English language courses** are popular among locals and expats |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Generally affordable, but may need to be imported |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools, but generally affordable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **University of the South Pacific** is a top-ranked university with a campus in Tonga, offering high-quality education and international recognition.\n- **Scholarships** are available for students who wish to pursue higher education, both locally and internationally.\n- **Online learning options** are becoming increasingly popular in Tonga, particularly for those who cannot access traditional education institutions.\n- Education quality in Tonga is generally good, but can vary depending on the institution and level of education.\n- **International schools** are a good option for expats and those who want a high-quality, internationally recognized education.\n- **Language courses** are a good way to learn **Tongan** or **English**, and can be beneficial for both locals and expats.",
