The archipelago is made up of 176 islands, of which 36 are inhabited, and is divided into three main groups: Tongatapu, Ha'apai, and Vava'u. Tonga is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the north, east, and south, and is surrounded by Fiji and Samoa to the west and northwest. The country's strategic location in the Pacific makes it a popular stopover for travelers and sailors.\n\nThe islands of Tonga are scattered over a vast area of the Pacific, with the capital city Nukualofa located on the southern coast of Tongatapu, the largest island. The country's location in the Pacific makes it prone to natural disasters such as cyclones and tsunamis, but also provides a unique opportunity to experience the rich culture and history of the region. The surrounding waters are home to a diverse range of marine life, including whales, dolphins, and sea turtles, making Tonga a popular destination for scuba diving and snorkeling.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe terrain of Tonga is characterized by coral reefs, white sandy beaches, and lush tropical forests. The islands are volcanic in origin, with the highest point being Kao Island, which rises to an elevation of 1,046 meters. The landscape is dominated by rugged hills and mountains, with steep cliffs and valleys carved out by ancient rivers. The coastal areas are generally flat and low-lying, with coral reefs and lagoons providing a habitat for a diverse range of marine life.\n\nThe islands of Tonga are covered in a thick layer of vegetation, with tropical forests, grasslands, and swamps providing a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna. The country is home to several species of birds, including the Tongan whistler and the blue-crowned lorikeet, as well as a variety of reptiles and amphibians. The coastal areas are lined with palm trees, hibiscus, and frangipani, giving the islands a picturesque and tropical feel.\n\nThe geology of Tonga is characterized by volcanic rocks, coral limestone, and sedimentary deposits. The islands are surrounded by coral reefs, which provide a barrier against the open ocean and create a calm and sheltered environment for marine life to thrive. The reefs are also an important source of food and income for the local population, with fishing and tourism being major industries in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Summer | December to February | 25-30°C | High | Humid and hot, with frequent rain showers |\n| Autumn | March to May | 20-25°C | Moderate | Mild and pleasant, with occasional rain showers |\n| Winter | June to August | 18-22°C | Low | Cool and dry, with clear skies and calm seas |\n| Spring | September to November | 20-25°C | Moderate | Mild and pleasant, with occasional rain showers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: June to August.
