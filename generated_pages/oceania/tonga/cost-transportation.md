[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Tonga is a small island nation with limited transportation options, and most people rely on **private vehicles**, **taxis**, or **buses** to get around. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with a network of buses and taxis connecting major towns and cities. However, the frequency and coverage of public transportation can be limited, especially in rural areas. The main transportation modes in Tonga include buses, taxis, and ferries, which connect the islands and provide access to remote areas.

The government has invested in improving the road network, and the condition of roads is generally good. However, the lack of public transportation options can make it difficult for people to get around, especially for those who do not own a private vehicle. In addition, the limited availability of **ride-hailing services** and **car-sharing options** can make it challenging for tourists and locals alike to find affordable and convenient transportation.
