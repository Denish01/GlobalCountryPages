[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Tonga is relatively small and developing, with a mix of traditional and modern properties. The market is driven by a combination of local demand and foreign investment, particularly in the tourism sector. Currently, the market is experiencing a steady growth in prices, especially in the capital city of Nukualofa, due to limited supply and increasing demand. Urban areas tend to have higher property prices compared to rural areas, where land is more readily available and affordable. However, rural areas often lack modern amenities and infrastructure, making them less attractive to some investors.

The Tongan government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including the development of new subdivisions and infrastructure projects. These initiatives are expected to increase the supply of properties and improve the overall attractiveness of the market. Additionally, the growing tourism industry is driving demand for **holiday homes** and **short-term rentals**, which is contributing to the growth of the property market.

The price trajectory of the property market in Tonga is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the increasing demand for properties and the limited supply. However, the market is not without its challenges, including the risk of **natural disasters** and the need for **property maintenance**. Despite these challenges, the property market in Tonga offers opportunities for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and tap into the growing tourism industry.
