[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Tonga is a small island nation with a developing economy, classified as upper-middle income by the World Bank. The country has a high level of human development, with a strong focus on education and healthcare. However, the economy is vulnerable to external shocks, including natural disasters and fluctuations in global commodity prices. The government has implemented policies to promote economic growth and diversification, including the development of the tourism sector and the promotion of foreign investment.

The economy of Tonga is also heavily reliant on remittances from Tongan citizens living abroad, which account for a significant portion of the country's GDP. The government has implemented measures to encourage the repatriation of these funds, including the establishment of a national remittance system. Despite these efforts, the economy remains vulnerable to external factors, including changes in global economic conditions and the impact of climate change.

Tonga's economic trajectory is shaped by its strategic location in the Pacific, with opportunities for trade and investment with neighboring countries and the wider region. The country is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum and the World Trade Organization, and has trade agreements with several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union. However, the economy faces significant challenges, including a lack of economic diversification, a high level of dependence on imports, and a need for infrastructure development.
