The government of Tonga is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the prime minister, who is responsible for advising the monarch and overseeing the administration of the government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Legislative Assembly, a unicameral body with 26 seats, 17 of which are elected by the people and 9 of which are held by nobles. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, and the Magistrates' Court. Tonga's system of government is **unitary**, with a centralized authority and no federal or regional governments.

The separation of powers in Tonga is designed to provide checks and balances on each branch of government. The monarch serves as a symbol of national unity and has significant influence, but their powers are limited by the constitution. The prime minister and the Legislative Assembly are responsible for making laws and overseeing the administration of the government. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are consistent with the constitution.

Tonga's **constitutional monarchy** has been in place since 1875, when the constitution was first adopted. The constitution has been amended several times since then, with the most recent amendments being made in 2010. The constitution establishes the framework for the government and the relationship between the monarch, the prime minister, and the Legislative Assembly.
