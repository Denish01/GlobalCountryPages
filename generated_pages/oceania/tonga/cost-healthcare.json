The public healthcare system is generally more affordable and accessible to locals, with most services being free or low-cost. However, the quality of care can vary, and some specialized services may not be available. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have **health insurance** that covers them in Tonga, as medical evacuation to another country may be necessary for serious conditions. Locals can access public healthcare services for free or at a low cost, but they may also choose to use private facilities if they can afford it.\n\nThe healthcare system in Tonga is generally geared towards providing basic medical care, with more complex cases often being referred to other countries such as Fiji or New Zealand. For this reason, it is essential for foreigners and locals alike to have a plan in place for accessing higher-level medical care if needed. **Health insurance** can provide peace of mind and financial protection in case of unexpected medical expenses. It is also important to note that some medical services, such as **dental care** and **optometry**, may not be widely available in Tonga, and foreigners may need to plan ahead for these services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have limited hours and availability |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Limited specialist services available in public system |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public system may have limited eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospital emergency room may have limited resources |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Public system may have limited surgical capabilities |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Limited availability of advanced imaging services |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Widely available in public and private facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Private hospital care, specialist services, advanced imaging |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Comprehensive medical coverage, including medical evacuation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medication** is generally available at public and private pharmacies, but the selection may be limited.\n- **Over-the-counter medication** is widely available, but prices may vary depending on the pharmacy and location.\n- **Antibiotics** and other essential medications are generally affordable, with prices starting from $5-$10.\n- **Specialized medication**, such as insulin or asthma inhalers, may be more expensive, with prices ranging from $20-$50.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Prescription rules** are generally similar to those in other countries, with most medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call for help as soon as possible.
