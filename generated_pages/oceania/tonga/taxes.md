Tonga operates a **territorial taxation** system, where only income earned within the country is subject to tax, except for residents who are taxed on their worldwide income. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must have been present in Tonga for at least six months in the tax year. Non-residents are only taxed on their Tongan-sourced income. The tax system is relatively simple, with a focus on encouraging foreign investment and economic growth.

The residency rules for tax purposes in Tonga are based on the individual's physical presence in the country. An individual is considered a resident if they have a permanent home in Tonga, or if they have been present in the country for at least six months in the tax year.
