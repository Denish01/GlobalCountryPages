# Tonga Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Tonga is relatively underdeveloped, with a focus on improving roads, energy, and telecommunications, but still facing challenges in providing reliable and widespread access to basic services, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 88% of population
Internet Penetration: 41%
Road Network: 680 km, moderate quality
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 1 international, 5 domestic
Major Ports: 3
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Tonga's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other Pacific Island nations. Recent investments have focused on upgrading roads, improving energy generation and distribution, and expanding telecommunications services. However, there remains a significant urban-rural gap in access to basic infrastructure services, with Nukualofa, the capital, generally having better access to services such as electricity, water, and internet. The government has been working to address these disparities through various development projects and initiatives. Despite these efforts, the country's infrastructure remains vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and tsunamis, which can cause significant damage and disruption to services.

The Tongan government has been actively seeking international assistance and investment to support infrastructure development, including funding from organizations such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. These investments have helped to improve the country's infrastructure, but more work is needed to achieve comprehensive and reliable access to basic services. The government has also been promoting private sector investment in infrastructure, particularly in the areas of energy and telecommunications.

Tonga's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic development, with the government seeking to promote economic growth and diversification through improvements in infrastructure. The country's strategic location in the Pacific makes it an important hub for trade and commerce, and the government is working to develop its infrastructure to support this role. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled labor and limited resources, which can hinder infrastructure development.

[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]
[TABLE]
| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roads | 680 km | Moderate | Mostly sealed, but some rural areas have poor road conditions |
| Railways | none | - | No rail network in Tonga |
| Airports | 1 international, 5 domestic | Good | Fua'amotu International Airport is the main airport |
| Ports | 3 major | Moderate | Ports in Nukualofa, Neiafu, and Pangai |
[/TABLE]

Tonga's transport infrastructure is relatively limited, with a focus on road transport and sea transport. The country has no rail network, and its airport and port facilities are limited. However, the government has been working to upgrade these facilities, including the expansion of Fua'amotu International Airport and the development of new port facilities. The country's road network is mostly sealed, but some rural areas have poor road conditions, making it difficult to access basic services.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- The main source of power generation is diesel, with some renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, being developed
- The reliability of the electricity supply is a concern, with frequent outages and load shedding during peak periods
- The government has been working to improve the efficiency and reliability of the energy sector, including the development of new power generation facilities and the upgrade of existing infrastructure
- Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are being promoted as a way to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels and improve energy security
- The Tonga Energy Roadmap 2010-2020 sets out a plan for the development of the energy sector, including the promotion of renewable energy and the improvement of energy efficiency

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- Access to safe drinking water is a concern, particularly in rural areas, where many people rely on rainwater collection and traditional water sources
- Sanitation coverage is relatively low, with many households lacking access to improved sanitation facilities
- The government has been working to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation, including the development of new water supply systems and the upgrade of existing infrastructure
- Water conservation is a major concern, particularly during periods of drought, and the government has been promoting water-saving measures and the use of rainwater collection systems
- The country's water and sanitation sector is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and tsunamis, which can cause significant damage to infrastructure and disrupt services

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- Mobile phone coverage is relatively widespread, with most areas having access to mobile phone services
- Internet penetration is relatively low, but has been increasing in recent years, particularly in urban areas
- The government has been working to improve telecommunications services, including the development of new fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of existing infrastructure
- The country's telecommunications sector is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and tsunamis, which can cause significant damage to infrastructure and disrupt services
- The Tonga Telecommunications Corporation is the main provider of telecommunications services, but there are also several private sector operators offering services

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The Tonga Road Upgrade Project, funded by the Asian Development Bank, aims to upgrade the country's road network and improve access to basic services
- The Tonga Energy Sector Development Project, funded by the World Bank, aims to improve the efficiency and reliability of the energy sector and promote the use of renewable energy sources
- The Nukualofa Port Development Project, funded by the Japanese government, aims to upgrade the port facilities in Nukualofa and improve the country's trade and commerce capabilities
- The Tonga Water and Sanitation Sector Development Project, funded by the Australian government, aims to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation, particularly in rural areas
- The Tonga Telecommunications Development Project, funded by the Chinese government, aims to improve telecommunications services, including the development of new fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of existing infrastructure
