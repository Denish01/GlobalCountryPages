  "content": "The population of Tonga is primarily composed of indigenous Tongans, with a small number of expatriates and foreign workers, totaling approximately 100,179 people.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 0.11 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.4%\nMedian Age: 22.4 years\nUrban Population: 23.1%\nPopulation Density: 134 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 76.4 years\nFertility Rate: 3.9 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nTonga's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in the Pacific region, with a total population of approximately 100,179 people. The population growth rate is relatively low, at 0.4% per annum, which is largely due to a decline in fertility rates and an increase in urbanization. The majority of the population lives in rural areas, with approximately 76.9% of the population residing in rural villages. However, there is a growing trend towards urbanization, with many young people moving to the capital city, Nukualofa, in search of employment and education opportunities.\n\nThe population of Tonga is also characterized by a high level of migration, with many Tongans living and working abroad, particularly in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with estimates suggesting that up to 50% of the total Tongan population lives abroad. Remittances from these migrant workers are an important source of income for many families in Tonga, and play a significant role in the country's economy.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by a small and dispersed population, Tonga has made significant progress in recent years in terms of economic development and social welfare. The country has a relatively high level of human development, with access to education and healthcare being generally good. However, there are still significant challenges to be addressed, particularly in terms of poverty and inequality, with many people living in rural areas lacking access to basic services and infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tongan | 96.5% | Throughout the country | Indigenous Polynesian people |\n| European | 2.2% | Nukualofa and other urban areas | Primarily of British and Australian descent |\n| East Asian | 0.6% | Nukualofa and other urban areas | Primarily of Chinese descent |\n| Pacific Islander | 0.5% | Nukualofa and other urban areas | From other Pacific Island countries, including Fiji and Samoa |\n| Other | 0.2% | Nukualofa and other urban areas | Including people of mixed ethnicity and other minority groups |\n[/TABLE]\nTonga is a culturally homogeneous society, with the vast majority of the population being indigenous Tongans.
