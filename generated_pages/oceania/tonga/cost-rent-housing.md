[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Tonga's rental market is relatively small, with a limited supply of properties available for rent, particularly in the city center. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under the Tongan **Fair Rent Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Fiji and Samoa, Tonga's housing costs are relatively moderate, with rent prices slightly lower than in Fiji but higher than in Samoa.

The housing market in Tonga is also influenced by the country's **tourism industry**, with many properties being used as holiday rentals or guesthouses. This can lead to a shortage of long-term rentals, particularly during peak tourist season. However, for those willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available in the suburbs and rural areas. With a **GDP per capita** of $7,803, Tonga has a relatively high standard of living, which can contribute to higher housing costs.
