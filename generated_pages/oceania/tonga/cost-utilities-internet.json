  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Tonga can vary, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $250 USD, while internet plans with 60 Mbps speed can cost around $50 to $100 USD per month.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($75 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.35 per kWh)\nCurrency: TOP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nTonga's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and telecommunications services. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand during the summer months (December to February) resulting in increased electricity and water costs. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but outages and disruptions can still occur, particularly during severe weather events. Overall, the quality of utility infrastructure in Tonga is good, but there is room for improvement in terms of efficiency and reliability.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Tonga is also influenced by the country's remote location and limited economy of scale, which can drive up prices. However, the government has implemented initiatives to promote renewable energy and reduce dependence on imported fuels, which is expected to lead to more stable and affordable utility prices in the long term. Additionally, the increasing competition in the telecommunications sector has led to more affordable internet and phone plans, making it easier for residents and businesses to access these essential services.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (bottled gas) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | Tonga Communications, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 60-100 Mbps | Tonga Communications, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Digicel, Vodafone |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Digicel, Vodafone |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-150 | varies | Tonga Communications, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (Tonga-based streaming services) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Tonga, it is recommended to contact the relevant providers (e.g. Tonga Communications for internet and phone, Tonga Power for electricity) and provide proof of residency and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience.\n- The best internet providers in Tonga are Tonga Communications and Digicel, which offer reliable and fast connections.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of promotional offers and discounts from service providers.\n- It is also a good idea to monitor your usage and adjust your plans accordingly to avoid excess charges and minimize waste.",
