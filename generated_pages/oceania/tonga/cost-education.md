[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Tonga is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for ensuring that all children have access to quality education. The country has a relatively high literacy rate, with approximately 99% of the population able to read and write. The language of instruction is primarily **Tongan**, although **English** is also widely used, particularly in secondary and tertiary education. Compulsory education in Tonga lasts for 6 years, from ages 5 to 11, and is generally provided free of charge by the government. However, the quality of public education can vary, and some parents may choose to send their children to private schools, which can offer a higher level of education and better facilities.

In terms of international schools, there are a limited number of options available in Tonga, primarily catering to the children of expatriates and wealthy locals. These schools often follow international curricula, such as the **International Baccalaureate** or **Cambridge International Examinations**, and can provide a high-quality education that is recognized globally. However, the cost of attending an international school in Tonga can be prohibitively expensive for many families, with annual fees ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 or more.
