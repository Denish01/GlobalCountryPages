[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Tonga has a **mixed healthcare system**, which combines public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable and accessible to locals, with most services being free or low-cost. However, the quality of care can vary, and some specialized services may not be available. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have **health insurance** that covers them in Tonga, as medical evacuation to another country may be necessary for serious conditions. Locals can access public healthcare services for free or at a low cost, but they may also choose to use private facilities if they can afford it.

The healthcare system in Tonga is generally geared towards providing basic medical care, with more complex cases often being referred to other countries such as Fiji or New Zealand. For this reason, it is essential for foreigners and locals alike to have a plan in place for accessing higher-level medical care if needed. **Health insurance** can provide peace of mind and financial protection in case of unexpected medical expenses. It is also important to note that some medical services, such as **dental care** and **optometry**, may not be widely available in Tonga, and foreigners may need to plan ahead for these services.
