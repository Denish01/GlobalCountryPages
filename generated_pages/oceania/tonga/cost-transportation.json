The quality of public transit is relatively good, with a network of buses and taxis connecting major towns and cities. However, the frequency and coverage of public transportation can be limited, especially in rural areas. The main transportation modes in Tonga include buses, taxis, and ferries, which connect the islands and provide access to remote areas.\n\nThe government has invested in improving the road network, and the condition of roads is generally good. However, the lack of public transportation options can make it difficult for people to get around, especially for those who do not own a private vehicle. In addition, the limited availability of **ride-hailing services** and **car-sharing options** can make it challenging for tourists and locals alike to find affordable and convenient transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-2 | $30-50 | Good coverage in Nukualofa |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-5 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly in Nukualofa |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2-3 | $1-2 | $5-10 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited options, mostly in Nukualofa |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50-2.00 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20-1.80 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-80 | Economy car, depending on the rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited parking options in Nukualofa |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Limited frequency, mostly on main islands |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-200 | Typical route, depending on the airline and season |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **public buses** or **minibuses**, which are relatively affordable and cover most areas.\n- For longer distances, **domestic flights** may be a more convenient option, but be prepared for higher costs.\n- When using **taxis**, it's a good idea to **negotiate the fare** before starting your journey to avoid any surprises.\n- Be aware of **limited parking options** in Nukualofa and plan accordingly.\n- Consider **renting a car** for more flexibility and convenience, especially if you plan to explore the islands.\n- Always **wear a seatbelt** and follow local traffic rules to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.",
