Citizens of over 30 countries can enter Tonga visa-free, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or need to apply for a visa in advance. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development.\n\nTonga's visa policy is also influenced by its membership in regional organizations, such as the Pacific Islands Forum, and its relationships with other countries in the region.

However, the visa requirements and regulations can change, so it is essential to check with the Tongan embassy or consulate for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 31 days | Can extend stay up to 6 months |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 31 days | Can extend stay up to 6 months |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 31 days | Can extend stay up to 6 months |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 31 days | Can extend stay up to 6 months |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 31 days | Can extend stay up to 6 months |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Visa required | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Visa required | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Tonga visa-free for up to 31 days, with the option to extend their stay up to 6 months.
