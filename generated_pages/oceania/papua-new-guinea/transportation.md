[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea has two main international airports: Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby and Kagamuga Airport in Mount Hagen. Direct flights are available from major hubs in Australia, Asia, and the Pacific, with **Air Niugini** being the national carrier. You can also enter the country overland from Indonesia, but this is not a common route due to the remote and rugged terrain. The main overland entry point is at the border town of Wutung, where you can cross from Indonesia's Papua province into Papua New Guinea's Sandaun province.

For those traveling from nearby countries, there are also several smaller airports and airstrips that receive international flights, including Gurney Airport in Alotau and Tokua Airport in Rabaul. However, these flights are often less frequent and may require a connection in a larger hub. It's also worth noting that Papua New Guinea has a number of **visa requirements** and **health regulations** that must be met before entering the country, so be sure to research these before planning your trip.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea has an extensive domestic air network, with **Air Niugini** and several smaller airlines operating flights to many of the country's provinces. The main routes connect Port Moresby to major towns like Lae, Mount Hagen, and Goroka, as well as to smaller destinations like Madang and Wewak. Booking domestic flights can be done online or through a local travel agent, and approximate costs range from $100 to $500 USD per flight, depending on the route and time of year. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as flights can fill up quickly.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea has no rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a railway system. As a result, there are no train or rail options available for getting around the country. This is due in part to the country's rugged terrain and lack of infrastructure, which has made it difficult to build and maintain a rail network.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are several bus and coach companies that operate in Papua New Guinea, connecting major towns and cities. These buses are often crowded and may not be as comfortable as those in other countries, but they are a relatively affordable option for getting around. The main bus companies include **PMV Bus Service** and **Boroko Bus Service**, which operate routes between Port Moresby, Lae, and other major towns. Fares are generally around $10 to $50 USD per trip, depending on the route and distance.
