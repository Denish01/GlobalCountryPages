As a result, utility costs can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the region and availability of services. The cost of utilities is also affected by seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season. Additionally, the lack of competition in the utility market means that prices can be higher than in other countries.\n\nThe Papua New Guinea government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, with investments in new power plants and water supply systems. However, the progress has been slow, and many areas still rely on traditional sources of energy, such as wood and charcoal. The cost of utilities is also affected by the country's remote location, with many areas accessible only by air or sea, which increases the cost of transporting goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $75 | $100 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (bottled gas) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in municipal fees) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$135** | **$180** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $60-$80 | 10-20 Mbps | Digicel, Telikom PNG |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-$150 | 50-100 Mbps | Digicel, Telikom PNG |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-$20 | 1-5 GB | Digicel, Telikom PNG |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$50 | 5-20 GB | Digicel, Telikom PNG |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-$150 | varies | Digicel, Telikom PNG |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | (available in major cities) |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | (available in major cities) |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited content) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the local service providers, such as Digicel or Telikom PNG, and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help to budget and manage electricity costs.\n- The best internet providers in Papua New Guinea are Digicel and Telikom PNG, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transport or walk instead of driving.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with service providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
