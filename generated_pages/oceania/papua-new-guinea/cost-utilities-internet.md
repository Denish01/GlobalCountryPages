[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Papua New Guinea is still developing, with many areas lacking access to reliable electricity, water, and gas supplies. As a result, utility costs can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the region and availability of services. The cost of utilities is also affected by seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season. Additionally, the lack of competition in the utility market means that prices can be higher than in other countries.

The Papua New Guinea government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, with investments in new power plants and water supply systems. However, the progress has been slow, and many areas still rely on traditional sources of energy, such as wood and charcoal. The cost of utilities is also affected by the country's remote location, with many areas accessible only by air or sea, which increases the cost of transporting goods and services.
