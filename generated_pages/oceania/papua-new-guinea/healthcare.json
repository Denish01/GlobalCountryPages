  "content": "Healthcare in Papua New Guinea is a mixed system that faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of accessibility and quality of care, especially in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 111\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nPapua New Guinea's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the main provider of healthcare services. The public healthcare system is overseen by the National Department of Health, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. However, the public healthcare system faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. The private sector, on the other hand, provides healthcare services to those who can afford them, and is generally considered to be of better quality than the public sector. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a universal healthcare scheme and the establishment of a health insurance scheme for public servants.\n\nThe quality of care in Papua New Guinea varies significantly depending on the location and type of healthcare provider. Urban areas, such as Port Moresby, have better access to healthcare services and higher quality care, while rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services and poorer quality care. This is due in part to the shortage of healthcare professionals in rural areas, as well as the lack of infrastructure and resources. As a result, many people in rural areas rely on traditional medicine and other forms of alternative care.\n\nThe government has made efforts to improve access to healthcare services in rural areas, including the establishment of rural health centers and the deployment of healthcare professionals to these areas. However, more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system in Papua New Guinea. The **universal healthcare scheme**, which was introduced in 2014, aims to provide all citizens with access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their ability to pay. However, the scheme has faced significant challenges, including a lack of funding and a shortage of healthcare professionals.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Port Moresby General Hospital | Port Moresby | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Pacific International Hospital | Port Moresby | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Modilon General Hospital | Madang | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Angau Memorial Hospital | Lae | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| St. Mary's Hospital | Rabaul | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Kundiawa General Hospital | Kundiawa | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is available in Papua New Guinea, but it is not widely available and is generally only accessible to those who can afford it.\n- **Local insurance options** are limited, but some companies, such as Pacific MMI, offer health insurance products.\n- **Coverage for expats** is available through some international insurance companies, such as Allianz and AXA.\n- **Costs** of health insurance in Papua New Guinea can be high, especially for comprehensive coverage.\n- **Government health insurance schemes** are available for public servants and some other groups, but these schemes are not always reliable and may not provide comprehensive coverage.\n- **Self-insurance** is also an option, where individuals pay out-of-pocket for healthcare services, but this can be expensive and may not provide adequate coverage.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Availability of medications** can be limited in Papua New Guinea, especially in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but some medications may be available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available in Papua New Guinea, but some brands may not be available.\n- **Costs** of medications can be high, especially for imported medications.\n- **Traditional medicine** is also widely used in Papua New Guinea, and some traditional remedies may be available at pharmacies and markets.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Papua New Guinea include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid fever.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include rabies, Japanese encephalitis, and meningococcal meningitis.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Papua New Guinea include malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Papua New Guinea, and visitors should avoid drinking untreated water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and visitors should avoid eating undercooked meat and raw vegetables.\n- **Insect-borne diseases** such as dengue fever and Zika virus are also present in Papua New Guinea.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Papua New Guinea, due to the limited availability of high-quality healthcare services.\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Papua New Guinea are not well-established, but some hospitals may offer specialized services such as orthopedic surgery.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are limited in Papua New Guinea, but some hospitals, such as the Port Moresby General Hospital, have received international accreditation.\n- **Cost savings** for medical tourism in Papua New Guinea may not be significant, due to the high costs of healthcare services and the limited availability of specialized services.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **What to do in an emergency** is to call the emergency number, 111, or to go to the nearest hospital.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can be a concern in Papua New Guinea, especially in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be far away, especially in rural areas, and transportation to hospital may be limited.\n- **Insurance claims** should be made as soon as possible after an emergency, and visitors should have all necessary documents and information ready.\n- **Emergency evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, and visitors should have a plan in place for emergency evacuation, including a reliable means of transportation and a destination hospital.",
