Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with deposit requirements usually equivalent to 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under the **Residential Tenancies Act**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as Indonesia and Australia, Papua New Guinea's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center. However, outside of the city center, rental prices can be more affordable, with options available for those on a tighter budget.\n\nThe housing market in Papua New Guinea is also characterized by a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly for low-income households. This has led to the development of informal settlements and squatter communities, where living conditions can be poor and access to basic services such as water and sanitation limited. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented initiatives aimed at increasing access to affordable housing, including the development of new housing estates and the provision of subsidies for low-income households.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $500-$800 | $300-$500 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | fully furnished, modern appliances |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,200 | family-friendly, secure complex |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$1,800 | spacious, executive-style |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$3,500 | prime locations, modern developments |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, established neighborhoods |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | rural areas, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Boroko**: a popular expat neighborhood with a range of accommodation options, including apartments and houses, with rents ranging from $800-$1,500 USD per month\n- **Gordons**: a secure and family-friendly neighborhood with a mix of apartments and houses, with rents ranging from $600-$1,200 USD per month\n- **Konedobu**: a coastal neighborhood with stunning views and a range of accommodation options, including apartments and houses, with rents ranging from $1,000-$2,500 USD per month\n- **Waigani**: a central neighborhood with a range of accommodation options, including apartments and houses, with rents ranging from $800-$1,800 USD per month\n- **Tokarara**: a suburban neighborhood with a mix of apartments and houses, with rents ranging from $400-$1,000 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Papua New Guinea [/SECTION]\n- Research thoroughly: it's essential to research the local market and understand the prices and conditions of different neighborhoods and accommodation options\n- Inspect before signing: always inspect the property before signing a lease to ensure it meets your needs and is in good condition\n- Negotiate rents: rents can often be negotiated, particularly for longer-term leases\n- Be aware of scams: be cautious of scams and always deal with reputable real estate agents or landlords\n- Understand utilities: utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so be sure to factor these costs into your budget\n- Consider security: security is a concern in Papua New Guinea, so consider the safety and security of the neighborhood and property when choosing accommodation.",
