  "content": "The education system in Papua New Guinea is a complex and multifaceted network that provides students with a range of opportunities, from primary education to university-level studies, despite facing various challenges and limitations. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 64.2%\nSchool System: 9 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: English, Tok Pisin, Hiri Motu\nAcademic Calendar: January to December\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 5,000 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Papua New Guinea is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory for 9 years, is divided into two cycles: elementary education (grades 1-3) and primary education (grades 4-8). Secondary education, which is not compulsory, is divided into two levels: lower secondary (grades 9-10) and upper secondary (grades 11-12). Tertiary education, which includes university and college programs, provides students with a range of academic and vocational training opportunities. The quality of education in Papua New Guinea varies, with public schools often facing challenges such as limited resources and inadequate infrastructure, while private schools tend to offer higher-quality education.\n\nThe public education system in Papua New Guinea is free, but it is often underfunded and understaffed, which can result in poor learning outcomes. In contrast, private schools, which are often expensive and exclusive, tend to offer better facilities, more qualified teachers, and higher academic standards. Despite these challenges, the Papua New Guinea government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curriculum standards and the provision of training and support for teachers.\n\nThe education system in Papua New Guinea also faces challenges related to accessibility and equity. Many rural areas lack access to schools, and girls and women often face significant barriers to education, including cultural and social norms that prioritize boys' education. To address these challenges, the government has implemented programs aimed at increasing access to education, particularly for disadvantaged groups, and promoting girls' education and women's empowerment.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
