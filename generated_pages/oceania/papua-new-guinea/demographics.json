The population growth rate is around 2.1%, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The median age is 22 years, indicating a relatively young population.

The population density is approximately 25 people per km2, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The life expectancy is around 65 years, and the fertility rate is approximately 3.8 children per woman.\n\nThe population of Papua New Guinea is expected to continue growing, with estimates suggesting that it will reach around 15 million people by 2030. This growth will likely put pressure on the country's resources, infrastructure, and services.

However, this urbanization trend also poses challenges, such as overcrowding, poverty, and inadequate access to basic services.\n\nThe population of Papua New Guinea is also characterized by significant migration patterns, both within the country and internationally. Many people move from rural areas to urban centers in search of work, education, and better living conditions.
