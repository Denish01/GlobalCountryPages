[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Papua New Guinea is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary greatly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily English, but Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu are also widely spoken. Compulsory education in Papua New Guinea lasts for 12 years, from elementary to secondary school. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of Port Moresby, offering a range of curricula including Australian, British, and American.

The quality of education in Papua New Guinea is a major concern, with many public schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more comprehensive education, with better facilities and more qualified staff. However, the cost of private education is out of reach for many Papua New Guineans, making it a luxury only available to the wealthy. International schools offer a high-quality education, but at a significant cost, making them accessible only to expatriates and wealthy locals.
