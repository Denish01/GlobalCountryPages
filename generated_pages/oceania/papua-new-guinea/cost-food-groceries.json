  "content": "The cost of food in Papua New Guinea can vary significantly depending on the location, with Port Moresby being one of the most expensive cities, and the average monthly grocery budget for one person ranging from $200 to $500 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($10 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($30 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($200-$500 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($3 USD)\nCurrency: PGK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nFood prices in Papua New Guinea are generally higher compared to other countries in the region, largely due to the country's remote location and limited transportation infrastructure. The cost of importing goods, especially food, drives prices up, making it challenging for locals and expats alike to afford basic necessities. However, the eating-out culture is not as prevalent as in other countries, and many people prefer to cook at home, which can be more cost-effective. Traditional staples such as sweet potatoes, taro, and rice are relatively affordable and form a significant part of the local diet.\n\nThe inflation rate in Papua New Guinea is relatively low, at 0.6% in 2024, which has helped to stabilize food prices. However, the cost of living in urban areas, particularly in Port Moresby, is higher compared to rural areas. The government's efforts to improve the agriculture sector and increase local food production have also contributed to a more stable food market. Despite these efforts, food prices can still fluctuate, and it is essential to be mindful of the prices and plan accordingly.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 10 PGK | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | 6 PGK | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 8 PGK | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 5 PGK | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 25 PGK | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 40 PGK | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 20 PGK | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00 | 8 PGK | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 6 PGK | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.20 | 5 PGK | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 30 PGK | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 4 PGK | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (traditional dishes like mumu or saksak) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-$50 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $60-$100 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of food items can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Papua New Guinea. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, especially for imported goods, while local markets offer fresh produce at lower prices. However, the quality and variety of products may differ between the two. It is recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, from local markets, while staples like rice, flour, and canned goods can be purchased from supermarkets. Bargaining is a common practice in local markets, and it is essential to be prepared to negotiate prices.\n\nIn general, local markets offer a more affordable and authentic shopping experience, with a wide range of traditional food items available. However, the condition and quality of the products may vary, and it is crucial to inspect the items carefully before purchasing. Supermarkets, on the other hand, provide a more convenient and hygienic shopping environment, but at a higher cost. It is essential to be aware of the prices and to plan accordingly, taking into account the budget and personal preferences.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Papua New Guinea is to buy traditional staples like sweet potatoes, taro, and rice, which are readily available and affordable.\n- Local markets offer a wide range of fresh produce, including fruits and vegetables, at lower prices compared to supermarkets.\n- **Mumu**, a traditional dish made from pit-cooked pork and vegetables, is a popular and affordable option.\n- **Saksak**, a dish made from sago and coconut milk, is another local staple that is relatively inexpensive.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, especially meat and dairy products, as they can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- Consider purchasing food items in bulk, especially staples like rice and flour, to save money and reduce waste.",
