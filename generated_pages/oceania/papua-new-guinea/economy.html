        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Papua New Guinea's economy is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $1,290. The country has a developing economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, mining, and services. The economy has experienced steady growth over the years, driven by a combination of factors including a growing population, increased investment in the mining and petroleum sectors, and a favorable business environment. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to education and healthcare, and a high level of corruption.</p>
        <p>Papua New Guinea's economy is also highly dependent on the export of natural resources, particularly oil, gas, and minerals. The country is rich in natural resources, with significant reserves of gold, copper, and nickel.

Despite these efforts, the country's economy remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices and is in need of diversification to reduce its reliance on a few key industries.</p>
        <p>The government of Papua New Guinea has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting economic development and reducing poverty. These include investments in infrastructure, such as roads and ports, and programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
