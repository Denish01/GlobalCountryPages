[SECTION] How Papua New Guinea Is Divided [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea is divided into 22 provinces, each with its own provincial government. These provinces are further divided into districts, which are then subdivided into local-level governments. The provinces are grouped into four main regions: the Highlands, the Momase, the Southern, and the Islands. This administrative structure allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while still maintaining a strong central government.

The country's division into provinces and regions reflects its cultural and geographical diversity. The provinces are often defined by the dominant language and cultural groups within them, and each region has its own unique character and identity. For example, the Highlands region is home to many traditional tribal groups, while the Islands region is known for its beautiful beaches and coral reefs.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with few paved roads outside of the major cities. Domestic flights are the most common way to travel between cities, with several airlines operating scheduled services. There are no trains in Papua New Guinea, and buses are often crowded and unreliable. Driving can be challenging, especially outside of the major cities, due to the rugged terrain and lack of road infrastructure. However, many tourists enjoy the adventure of traveling by four-wheel drive or on foot, taking in the stunning scenery and traditional villages along the way.

For those who prefer a more leisurely pace, there are also several tour operators that offer guided tours and transportation services. These can be a good option for those who are short on time or prefer not to navigate the country's challenging roads and infrastructure. Additionally, many of the major cities have taxi services and rental car companies, making it easier to get around without a private vehicle. [CALLOUT] It's always a good idea to research and plan ahead when traveling in Papua New Guinea, as the transportation options can be limited and unpredictable.
