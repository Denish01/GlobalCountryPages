[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea has a limited but developing transportation network, with most people relying on **public motor vehicles (PMVs)**, which are privately owned buses and minivans that operate on fixed routes. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Port Moresby having a more extensive network than other urban areas. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on **walking** or **cycling** for short trips, while others use **taxis** or **ride-hailing services** for longer journeys.

The country's rugged terrain and limited infrastructure make it challenging to develop a comprehensive transportation network. However, efforts are being made to improve the road network and expand public transportation services. In the meantime, visitors and locals alike must be prepared for varying levels of service quality and costs depending on the location and mode of transport. For example, in Port Moresby, the capital city, there are several **bus companies** that operate on fixed routes, while in other cities, **minibuses** and **taxis** are more commonly used.

[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]
- To save money on transport, consider using **public motor vehicles (PMVs)** or **minibuses**, which are often cheaper than taxis or ride-hailing services.
- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Grab or PMV to book taxis or private cars, which can be more convenient and safer than hailing on the street.
- Always **negotiate the fare** before starting a journey, especially when using taxis or PMVs.
- Be aware of **safety concerns**, such as traffic accidents and petty crime, and take necessary precautions to stay safe while traveling.
- Consider **renting a car** for longer trips or to explore rural areas, but be aware of the variable road conditions and limited infrastructure.
- Use **local currency (PGK)** when possible, as not all businesses accept foreign currency, and be prepared for **price variations** between cities and regions.
