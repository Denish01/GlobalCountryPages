[SECTION] How Expensive Is Papua New Guinea? [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea is considered a moderate to expensive country to live in or visit, especially when compared to its neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. The cost of living in Papua New Guinea is higher due to its remote location, limited infrastructure, and reliance on imports. However, the country offers a unique cultural experience and breathtaking natural beauty, making it an attractive destination for adventure seekers and travelers. Compared to its neighbors, Indonesia and Australia, Papua New Guinea is more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food.
