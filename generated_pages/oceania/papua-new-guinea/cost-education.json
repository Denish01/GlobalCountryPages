  "content": "The cost of education in Papua New Guinea varies greatly depending on the type of institution, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private and international schools can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 0.8%\nLiteracy Rate: 64%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 12 months\nCurrency: PGK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Papua New Guinea is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary greatly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily English, but Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu are also widely spoken. Compulsory education in Papua New Guinea lasts for 12 years, from elementary to secondary school. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of Port Moresby, offering a range of curricula including Australian, British, and American.\n\nThe quality of education in Papua New Guinea is a major concern, with many public schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more comprehensive education, with better facilities and more qualified staff. However, the cost of private education is out of reach for many Papua New Guineans, making it a luxury only available to the wealthy. International schools offer a high-quality education, but at a significant cost, making them accessible only to expatriates and wealthy locals.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$50 | Free or subsidized, variable quality |\n| Private Primary | $200-$1,000 | Range by tier, from basic to high-end |\n| Public Secondary | $50-$100 | Free or subsidized, variable quality |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,500 | Range by tier, from basic to high-end |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | Curriculum types include Australian, British, and American |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited scholarships available |\n| Private University | $1,000-$2,500 | $2,000-$5,000 | Range by institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$3,000 | $2,500-$6,000 | University of Papua New Guinea, limited scholarships available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited availability, primarily in urban areas |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Range by tutor and subject |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$200 | Range by institution and language |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Basic supplies, variable cost |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Mandatory for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- Expatriates and international students often opt for international schools, which offer a high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- Scholarships are limited, but available for high-achieving students, particularly in public universities.\n- Online learning options are limited, but some institutions offer distance learning programs.\n- Education quality in Papua New Guinea is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, particularly in public schools.\n- **English language proficiency** is a major advantage for students seeking to pursue higher education or career opportunities.\n- Parents and students should research schools thoroughly, considering factors such as curriculum, facilities, and teacher qualifications, to ensure they find the best fit for their needs and budget.",
