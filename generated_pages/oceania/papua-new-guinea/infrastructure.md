# Papua New Guinea Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Papua New Guinea is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 34% of population
Internet Penetration: 13%
Road Network: 9,000 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 21
Major Ports: 7
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has faced significant challenges in providing basic services to its population, particularly in rural areas. Recent investments in infrastructure development have focused on improving access to electricity, water, and sanitation, as well as upgrading the country's transportation network. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services. The government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including the development of a national infrastructure plan and the establishment of a dedicated infrastructure agency.

The country's infrastructure development has also been hindered by its rugged terrain and lack of connectivity. Many rural areas are accessible only by air or sea, making it difficult and expensive to provide basic services. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant progress in recent years, including the development of new roads, bridges, and airports. The private sector has also played a key role in infrastructure development, with several major companies investing in the country's mining, oil, and gas sectors.

Overall, Papua New Guinea's infrastructure development is a complex and ongoing challenge. While significant progress has been made in recent years, much work remains to be done to provide basic services to the country's population. The government and private sector will need to continue to work together to address the country's infrastructure gaps and provide a foundation for sustainable economic growth and development.
