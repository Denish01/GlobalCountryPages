The market is driven by the country's natural resources sector, with many foreign companies investing in mining, oil, and gas projects. As a result, there is a high demand for rental properties, particularly in Port Moresby and other major cities. The price trajectory of properties in Papua New Guinea has been steadily increasing over the years, with a significant surge in prices in recent years due to the country's economic growth. However, the market is still relatively underdeveloped, and prices can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas.\n\nThe urban property market in Papua New Guinea is dominated by Port Moresby, which is the capital and largest city. The city has a range of properties, from high-end apartments and houses to more affordable options. Lae and Madang are other major cities with a significant property market, with a mix of residential and commercial developments. In contrast, rural areas have limited property developments, with most properties being traditional villages or small towns.\n\nThe property market in Papua New Guinea is also influenced by the country's cultural and traditional practices. For example, land ownership is often communal, with land being held by clans or tribes rather than individual owners. This can make it difficult for foreigners to purchase land, as they may need to navigate complex traditional ownership structures.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Port Moresby | $1,500 | $1,000 | Apartment |\n| Lae | $1,000 | $600 | House |\n| Madang | $800 | $400 | Apartment |\n| Goroka | $600 | $300 | House |\n| Mount Hagen | $500 | $250 | Apartment |\n| Kokoda | $400 | $200 | House |\n| Alotau | $350 | $180 | Apartment |\n| Vanimo | $300 | $150 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Papua New Guinea, but they must obtain approval from the **Internal Revenue Commission** and the **Land Board**.\n- Foreigners can only buy property for **business or investment purposes**, and not for personal use.\n- Foreigners can lease land from local landowners for up to **99 years**, with the option to renew.\n- Foreign companies can own property in Papua New Guinea, but they must be registered with the **Investment Promotion Authority**.\n- Foreigners must obtain a **foreign investment approval** from the **Investment Promotion Authority** before purchasing property.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
