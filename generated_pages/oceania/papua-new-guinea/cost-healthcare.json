  "content": "Healthcare costs in Papua New Guinea can vary significantly depending on the type of care and whether you choose public or private facilities, with the World Bank reporting a health expenditure per capita of $85 in 2023.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $85 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 8.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 111\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: PGK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nPapua New Guinea has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private facilities. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but are typically more expensive and may not be accessible to the general population. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary option, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private care. It is highly recommended to have health insurance when living in or visiting Papua New Guinea, as medical costs can be high and the public system may not provide the level of care that foreigners are accustomed to.\n\nThe healthcare system in Papua New Guinea faces numerous challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, limited access to healthcare facilities, and a high burden of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system, including initiatives to increase access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the quality of care, availability of medical facilities, and the need for health insurance. Many private healthcare facilities in Papua New Guinea cater to foreigners and offer high-quality care, but at a higher cost than public facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private specialists may require upfront payment |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private dentists may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Public eye care services may be limited |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-$10 | $10-$20 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Private hospitals may offer more specialized surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private imaging centers may offer more advanced technology |\n| X-Ray | $10-$30 | Public hospitals may have limited imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Private hospital care, specialized medical services, dental and eye care |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be expensive, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 per month\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may be more expensive than in other countries\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not always have the latest or most advanced medications\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a local doctor\n- Generic medications may be available at a lower cost than brand-name medications\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medications with you when traveling to Papua New Guinea, as they may not be available locally\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek immediate attention at a hospital or medical facility.
