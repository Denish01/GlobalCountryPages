[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the main provider of healthcare services. The public healthcare system is overseen by the National Department of Health, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. However, the public healthcare system faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. The private sector, on the other hand, provides healthcare services to those who can afford them, and is generally considered to be of better quality than the public sector. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a universal healthcare scheme and the establishment of a health insurance scheme for public servants.

The quality of care in Papua New Guinea varies significantly depending on the location and type of healthcare provider. Urban areas, such as Port Moresby, have better access to healthcare services and higher quality care, while rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services and poorer quality care. This is due in part to the shortage of healthcare professionals in rural areas, as well as the lack of infrastructure and resources. As a result, many people in rural areas rely on traditional medicine and other forms of alternative care.

The government has made efforts to improve access to healthcare services in rural areas, including the establishment of rural health centers and the deployment of healthcare professionals to these areas. However, more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system in Papua New Guinea. The **universal healthcare scheme**, which was introduced in 2014, aims to provide all citizens with access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their ability to pay. However, the scheme has faced significant challenges, including a lack of funding and a shortage of healthcare professionals.
