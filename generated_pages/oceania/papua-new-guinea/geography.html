        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Papua New Guinea is located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, situated on the island of New Guinea. It is part of the continent of Oceania and is bordered by two countries: Indonesia to the west and Australia to the south. The country is surrounded by several bodies of water, including the Pacific Ocean to the north and east, the Solomon Sea to the southeast, and the Arafura Sea to the southwest. The island of New Guinea is shared with Indonesia, with Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.</p>
        <p>The country's unique location has resulted in a diverse geography, with a range of landscapes and ecosystems. The island of New Guinea is relatively close to the equator, which contributes to its tropical climate. The country's proximity to the Pacific Ocean and the surrounding seas has also played a significant role in shaping its culture and history, with many coastal communities relying on fishing and trade for their livelihood. The border with Indonesia is a significant one, with the two countries sharing a common island and cultural heritage.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Papua New Guinea is a country of immense geographical diversity, with a range of landscapes and ecosystems. The country is home to some of the most rugged and inaccessible terrain in the world, with dense rainforests, towering mountain ranges, and vast river systems. The <strong>Owen Stanley Range</strong> is one of the most prominent mountain ranges in the country, stretching across the southeastern part of the island and including the country's highest point, <strong>Puncak Jaya</strong>. The range is known for its steep slopes, deep valleys, and diverse flora and fauna.</p>
        <p>The country's terrain is also characterized by numerous rivers, including the <strong>Sepik River</strong> and the <strong>Fly River</strong>, which flow through the northern and southern parts of the island, respectively. These rivers have played a significant role in shaping the country's landscape and have supported the development of many communities along their banks. The country's coastline is also notable, with a range of beaches, bays, and fjords. The <strong>D'Entrecasteaux Islands</strong> and the <strong>Trobriand Islands</strong> are two notable archipelagos located off the country's eastern coast.</p>
        <p>In addition to its rugged terrain, Papua New Guinea is also home to a range of unique and diverse ecosystems. The country's rainforests are some of the most biodiverse in the world, with many species of plants and animals found nowhere else. The <strong>Trans-Fly Ecosystem</strong> is a unique and fragile ecosystem located in the southern part of the island, characterized by a mix of savannas, grasslands, and mangrove forests.</p>
        <h2>Climate By Season</h2>
