[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private facilities. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but are typically more expensive and may not be accessible to the general population. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary option, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private care. It is highly recommended to have health insurance when living in or visiting Papua New Guinea, as medical costs can be high and the public system may not provide the level of care that foreigners are accustomed to.

The healthcare system in Papua New Guinea faces numerous challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, limited access to healthcare facilities, and a high burden of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system, including initiatives to increase access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the quality of care, availability of medical facilities, and the need for health insurance. Many private healthcare facilities in Papua New Guinea cater to foreigners and offer high-quality care, but at a higher cost than public facilities.
