        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Papua New Guinea's culture is defined by its incredible diversity, with over 800 languages spoken across the country. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of the population is equally diverse, with more than 10,000 different ethnic groups. The key influences on Papua New Guinea's culture come from its indigenous heritage, as well as from European, Asian, and Pacific Islander settlers. The country's cultural identity is also shaped by its geographic location, with the island of New Guinea being home to some of the most traditional and isolated societies in the world.</p>
        <p>The cultural identity of Papua New Guinea is also reflected in its <strong>tribal</strong> systems, with many communities maintaining their own unique customs, traditions, and languages. The country's cultural heritage is also evident in its many <strong>traditional festivals</strong> and ceremonies, which are an important part of Papua New Guinean life. The <strong>Hiri trade</strong>, a traditional trade network that existed between the Motu people and other coastal communities, is another example of the country's rich cultural heritage. The Hiri trade played an important role in shaping the country's cultural identity, with the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices between different communities.</p>
        <p>Papua New Guinea's cultural identity is also influenced by its history, with the country having been a German, British, and Australian colony at various points in time. This has resulted in a unique blend of traditional and Western cultural influences, with many Papua New Guineans embracing modernity while still maintaining their traditional customs and practices. The country's cultural identity is also reflected in its <strong>national symbols</strong>, such as the bird of paradise, which is an important cultural icon in Papua New Guinea.</p>
