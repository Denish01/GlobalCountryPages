[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Papua New Guinea is still in the early stages of development, with a significant urban-rural divide in terms of availability and quality. While the capital city Port Moresby and other major towns have relatively better internet connectivity, the rural areas suffer from poor or no coverage at all. The average internet speed in Papua New Guinea is around 5 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. The reliability of the internet is also a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions, especially during bad weather.

The government has been working to improve the internet infrastructure in the country, with initiatives such as the construction of a new undersea cable to connect Papua New Guinea to the global internet network. However, these efforts are still in the early stages, and it may take some time before the internet quality improves significantly. In the meantime, users in Papua New Guinea have to contend with slow speeds, high costs, and limited availability. For tourists and travelers, the best option is to purchase a local SIM card or rent a portable Wi-Fi hotspot to stay connected during their stay.
