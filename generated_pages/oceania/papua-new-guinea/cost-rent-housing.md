[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Papua New Guinea's rental market is relatively small and expensive, particularly in the capital city of Port Moresby, where demand for housing exceeds supply. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with deposit requirements usually equivalent to 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under the **Residential Tenancies Act**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as Indonesia and Australia, Papua New Guinea's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center. However, outside of the city center, rental prices can be more affordable, with options available for those on a tighter budget.

The housing market in Papua New Guinea is also characterized by a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly for low-income households. This has led to the development of informal settlements and squatter communities, where living conditions can be poor and access to basic services such as water and sanitation limited. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented initiatives aimed at increasing access to affordable housing, including the development of new housing estates and the provision of subsidies for low-income households.
