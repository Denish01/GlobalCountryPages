  "content": "The Pitcairn Islands, a remote territory in Oceania, is home to a small and unique population of around 35 residents, with a distinct cultural identity shaped by its history and isolation.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: (5e-05 million)\nPopulation Growth Rate: (-4%)\nMedian Age: (55 years)\nUrban Population: (100%)\nPopulation Density: (0.74 per km2)\nLife Expectancy: (75 years)\nFertility Rate: (1.5 children per woman)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Pitcairn Islands have a tiny population, with the latest estimates suggesting around 35 residents, making it one of the smallest populations in the world. The population has been declining over the years, with a negative growth rate of approximately -4% due to a combination of factors, including low fertility rates and limited job opportunities. The islands' remote location and lack of economic opportunities have led to a steady decline in population, with many young people leaving to pursue education and career opportunities elsewhere. The urban population is 100%, as the entire population resides in the capital, Adamstown, which is the only settlement on the island.\n\nThe population of the Pitcairn Islands is also characterized by a high median age, with approximately 55 years, indicating an aging population. This has significant implications for the islands' economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is nearing retirement age. The population density is very low, with only 0.74 people per square kilometer, making it one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world. The life expectancy is around 75 years, which is relatively high compared to other small island nations.\n\nThe Pitcairn Islands' population has been shaped by its history, with the descendants of the **Bounty** mutineers and their Polynesian companions forming the core of the population. The islands' isolation has helped preserve a unique cultural identity, with a strong sense of community and shared history. However, the declining population and limited economic opportunities pose significant challenges to the long-term sustainability of the community.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pitcairn Islanders | 100% | Adamstown | Descendants of Bounty mutineers and Polynesian companions |\n| European | 0% |  | No significant European population |\n| Polynesian | 0% |  | Some Polynesian ancestry among Pitcairn Islanders |\n| Asian | 0% |  | No significant Asian population |\n| Other | 0% |  | No significant other ethnic groups |\n[/TABLE]\nThe Pitcairn Islands have a homogeneous ethnic population, with all residents identifying as **Pitcairn Islanders**, who are the descendants of the **Bounty** mutineers and their Polynesian companions.
