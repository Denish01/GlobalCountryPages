The islands have no airport, and the primary way to get there is by boat. The **Government of Pitcairn Islands** operates a supply ship, the Claymore II, which travels from Mangareva, French Polynesia, to Pitcairn Island several times a year. This journey can take around 32 hours, depending on the weather conditions. There are no direct flight hubs or overland entry points to the Pitcairn Islands, and visitors must be prepared for a long and potentially rough sea journey.\n\nThe **Claymore II** is not a passenger ferry, but it can accommodate a limited number of passengers. The ship's schedule and availability can be unpredictable, and visitors must be flexible with their travel plans. It is essential to book well in advance and be prepared for the challenges of traveling to such a remote location. The **Pitcairn Island Government** website provides information on the ship's schedule and travel requirements, and it is recommended that visitors check the website regularly for updates.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThere are no domestic flights in the Pitcairn Islands, as the islands have no airport.
