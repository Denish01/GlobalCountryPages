[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The housing market in Pitcairn Islands is unique due to the island's remote location and limited population. The rental market is relatively small, with most properties being owned by the government or local residents. Typical lease terms are short-term, ranging from 6-12 months, and deposit requirements are usually one month's rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through community mediation. Compared to regional neighbors, such as Fiji and Tonga, Pitcairn Islands' housing costs are relatively low. However, the limited availability of housing and lack of infrastructure can make it challenging for expats to find suitable accommodation.

The Pitcairn Islands government plays a significant role in the housing market, providing subsidized housing for locals and managing the limited number of available properties. The island's remote location and limited connectivity also impact the housing market, with most goods and services being imported from New Zealand. As a result, the cost of living on the island can be relatively high, despite the low housing costs. Expats and visitors should be prepared for a unique and challenging living environment, with limited access to amenities and services.
