[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Pitcairn Islands are a remote territory in the Pacific Ocean, and as such, the transportation options are limited. The main mode of transportation is by boat, with the island's supply ship, the Claymore II, being the primary means of transportation to and from the island. Within the island, most people get around on foot or by using the island's limited number of vehicles, which are mostly four-wheel drive trucks and quad bikes. The quality of public transit is not applicable, as there is no public transportation system in place.

The island's rugged terrain and limited infrastructure make it difficult to get around, and the lack of public transportation means that most people rely on their own vehicles or walk to get where they need to go. The island's residents are a close-knit community, and it is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride with their neighbors or friends to get around the island. The island's government also provides some transportation services, including a boat service to and from the island's outer islands.
