[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Pitcairn Islands have a **unitary system** of government, with the Island Council serving as the sole legislative body. The Council is composed of 10 members, including 8 elected representatives, 1 ex-officio member (the Mayor of Adamstown), and 1 appointed member (the Governor's representative). The Island Council is responsible for making laws and overseeing the administration of the island. The **separation of powers** is not strictly defined, as the Executive and Legislative branches are not entirely separate. However, the Governor of the Pitcairn Islands, who represents the British monarch, serves as the head of state and has certain reserve powers.

The Pitcairn Islands' government is also influenced by traditional leadership and community involvement. The **Mayor of Adamstown** serves as the head of government and is responsible for chairing the Island Council. Decision-making is often a collaborative process, involving community leaders and representatives. The island's small population and close-knit community contribute to a unique system of governance that blends formal and informal structures.

The Pitcairn Islands' political system is also shaped by its relationship with the **United Kingdom**. As a British Overseas Territory, the island is subject to the British monarch's authority, and the Governor of the Pitcairn Islands represents the monarch on the island. However, the island has a significant degree of autonomy, with the Island Council responsible for most domestic matters.
