The school is a public institution, and education is free or heavily subsidized for all students. The language of instruction is **English**, and the curriculum is based on the New Zealand education system. The school provides a basic education in subjects such as mathematics, science, and language arts, but the quality of education can be limited by the island's remote location and lack of resources.\n\nThe school system in Pitcairn Islands is not divided into primary and secondary schools, but rather provides a continuous education from age 5 to 15.

There are no private or international schools on the island, and students who wish to pursue higher education must do so off-island.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public School | $0 (free) | Limited resources, basic education |\n| Private School | Not available |  |\n| International School | Not available |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | Not available | Not available | Students typically attend university in New Zealand or other countries |\n| Private University | Not available | Not available |  |\n| Top-Ranked University | Not available | Not available |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $0 (free) | Limited availability, informal care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | Not available |  |\n| Language Course (monthly) | Not available |  |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100-$200 | Limited availability, basic supplies |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The quality of education in Pitcairn Islands is limited by the island's remote location and lack of resources, but the school provides a basic education in essential subjects.\n- There are no **scholarship** opportunities available for students on the island, but students may be eligible for scholarships to attend school in New Zealand or other countries.\n- **Online learning** options are limited on the island due to restricted internet access, but students may be able to access online courses and resources through schools in New Zealand or other countries.\n- The education system in Pitcairn Islands is based on the New Zealand education system, which is considered to be of high quality.\n- Students who wish to pursue higher education must do so off-island, which can be a significant challenge due to the island's remote location and limited access to resources.\n- The **best schools** for expats in Pitcairn Islands are not available, as there are no international schools on the island and the public school provides a basic education to all residents.",
