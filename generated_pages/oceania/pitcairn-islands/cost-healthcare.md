[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Pitcairn Islands is a public system, with the government providing basic medical services to all residents. However, due to the remote location and limited resources, the quality of healthcare can be limited, and many medical procedures and services are not available on the island. Locals and foreigners alike may need to be referred to New Zealand or other nearby countries for more complex medical care. The system is generally designed to provide basic primary care, with more specialized care being referred to outside the island. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the cost of medical evacuations and treatment in other countries.

The public healthcare system in Pitcairn Islands is relatively simple, with a single clinic providing basic medical services. The clinic is staffed by a nurse and a doctor who visits the island periodically. For more complex medical care, patients are typically referred to New Zealand or other nearby countries. Foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for medical services, although some countries have reciprocal healthcare agreements with New Zealand that may cover some costs. It is essential for visitors and expats to have adequate health insurance to cover the cost of medical evacuations and treatment in other countries.
