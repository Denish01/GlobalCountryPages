The government, which is a part of the United Kingdom, has a positive attitude toward foreign investment, but the reality is that the island's tiny population and limited resources make it difficult to establish and sustain a business. The bureaucracy level is relatively low due to the small size of the government, but the lack of skilled labor and limited access to services can create significant challenges. Corruption is not a significant issue due to the small and tight-knit community.\n\nThe Pitcairn Islands government is keen to attract foreign investment to boost the local economy and improve the standard of living for its residents. However, the island's isolation and limited connectivity make it difficult to establish a viable business. The government has implemented some measures to support entrepreneurship, such as providing subsidies for **renewable energy** projects and encouraging **ecotourism** initiatives.
