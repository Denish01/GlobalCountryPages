The capital, Adamstown, is the only settlement on the island and serves as the administrative center. The island's government is responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure to the residents.\n\nThe lack of administrative divisions on the Pitcairn Islands is due to its small size and population. The island's remote location and limited resources also contribute to its simple administrative structure. Despite its small size, the Pitcairn Islands have a unique cultural identity and a rich history, with the island being settled by the descendants of the mutineers from the HMS Bounty in 1790.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Adamstown** (population 35)\nRole: capital, administrative center, and only settlement\nKnown For: Adamstown is the only settlement on the Pitcairn Islands and serves as the administrative center, with a rich history and culture.

The island's rugged terrain and lack of roads make it difficult to get around, and the only way to travel is on foot or by boat. The island's harbour is the main entry point, and boats are used to transport people and goods between the island and other destinations. The lack of transportation infrastructure and limited access to the island make it a challenging destination to visit, but also contribute to its unique charm and character.\n\nVisitors to the Pitcairn Islands typically arrive by boat, and the journey can be long and arduous.
