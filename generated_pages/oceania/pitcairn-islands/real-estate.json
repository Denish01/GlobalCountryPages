  "content": "The Pitcairn Islands, a remote territory in Oceania, has a highly restricted property market, with only a handful of properties available for sale or rent, and foreigners can buy, but with significant restrictions.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nCan Foreigners Buy?: Restricted\nAverage Price (Capital, per sqm): $1,500 USD\nRental Yield: 2%\nProperty Tax: 0.5%\nPopular Areas: Adamstown, Bounty Bay, Pitcairn Island\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]\nThe property market in Pitcairn Islands is extremely limited, with only around 35 residents and a total area of 47 km². The market is largely driven by the needs of the local population, with most properties being passed down through generations. The prices of properties are relatively high due to the islands' remote location and limited accessibility. The market is also subject to fluctuations based on the availability of government subsidies and external aid. Urban areas, such as Adamstown, are more sought after due to their proximity to amenities, while rural areas are more suited for those looking for a self-sufficient lifestyle.\n\nThe current market conditions are characterized by a lack of supply, with most properties being owned by the local government or long-term residents. The price trajectory has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations due to external factors such as global economic trends. The urban vs rural divide is not as pronounced as in other countries, with most residents living in close proximity to each other. However, the limited availability of properties and the restrictive ownership rules make it challenging for foreigners to invest in the local property market.\n\nThe Pitcairn Islands government has implemented various initiatives to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth, including the development of a new **sustainable tourism** industry. However, these initiatives are still in their infancy, and the property market remains largely underdeveloped. As a result, investors looking to enter the market must be prepared to navigate a complex and often challenging environment.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adamstown | 1,800 | 500 | Residential |\n| Bounty Bay | 1,500 | 400 | Residential |\n| Pitcairn Island | 1,200 | 300 | Rural |\n| Henderson Island | 1,000 | 200 | Rural |\n| Ducie Island | 800 | 150 | Rural |\n| Oeno Island | 600 | 100 | Rural |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Pitcairn Islands, but they must obtain a **special permit** from the local government, which can be a lengthy and complex process.\n- Foreigners are restricted from buying property in certain areas, such as **conservation zones** and **indigenous land**.\n- Foreigners can lease property from the local government or private owners, but the lease term is typically limited to 20 years.\n- Foreign companies can own property in Pitcairn Islands, but they must be registered with the local government and meet certain **taxation** and **regulatory** requirements.\n- Foreigners must also comply with **environmental** and **planning** regulations, which can be stringent due to the islands' unique ecosystem.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
