[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet quality in the Pitcairn Islands is generally poor, with slow speeds and limited availability. The island's remote location and small population make it difficult to establish and maintain high-speed internet infrastructure. The urban vs rural divide is not a significant issue, as the island's population is concentrated in Adamstown, the capital. However, the reliability of the internet connection can be a problem, with frequent outages and disruptions due to weather conditions and satellite connectivity issues.

The government and local authorities have made efforts to improve internet connectivity, but the progress has been slow. The island's internet service provider, Pitcairn Island Telecom, offers limited internet plans with slow speeds, making it challenging for residents and visitors to stay connected. The lack of competition and limited infrastructure contribute to the high cost of internet services, making it inaccessible to many.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in the Pitcairn Islands, visitors can purchase one from the Pitcairn Island Telecom office in Adamstown. The process is relatively straightforward, and visitors will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 20 USD, and it comes with a limited data plan. The recommended carrier is Pitcairn Island Telecom, as it is the only mobile network provider on the island.

Visitors can choose from a range of data plans, including prepaid and postpaid options. The data plans are limited, and the speeds are slow, but they can be sufficient for basic internet browsing and communication. It is essential to note that the SIM card may not work outside of the Pitcairn Islands, and roaming services are not available.
