Pitcairn Islands is a remote territory with a high cost of living, mainly due to its isolation and limited access to amenities. The estimated GDP per capita (PPP) of $14,400 suggests a relatively high standard of living, but the reality is that the cost of living is inflated by the need to import most goods and services. A budget of $1,800 per month would be sufficient for basic needs, but it would require careful planning and a simple lifestyle. A mid-range budget of $3,000 per month would provide more comfort and flexibility, while a comfortable lifestyle would require around $4,500 per month. Compared to neighboring countries, Pitcairn Islands is one of the most expensive places to live in the Pacific.

The high cost of living in Pitcairn Islands is driven by the need to import most goods and services, including food, fuel, and construction materials. The lack of economies of scale and the high cost of transportation contribute to the elevated prices. However, the unique culture and stunning natural beauty of the islands make them an attractive destination for those who can afford it. In comparison to other Pacific island nations, Pitcairn Islands is more expensive than Fiji and Samoa, but similar to the Cook Islands and Niue.
