The islands are a British Overseas Territory, and as such, the visa policy is closely tied to that of the United Kingdom. However, due to the remote location and limited accessibility of the islands, the visa requirements are more restrictive than those of the UK. Citizens of certain countries, including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, can enter the Pitcairn Islands without a visa, while others will need to apply for a visa in advance.\n\nThe visa policy of the Pitcairn Islands is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate tourism and other legitimate travel to the islands.

As a result, visitors can expect a rigorous application process and strict entry requirements.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 14 days | Must apply in advance through the Pitcairn Islands Government Office |\n| UK Citizens | No | N/A | 6 months | Can enter visa-free as a British Overseas Territory citizen |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 14 days | Must apply in advance through the Pitcairn Islands Government Office |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 14 days | Must apply in advance through the Pitcairn Islands Government Office |\n| Australian Citizens | No | N/A | 6 months | Can enter visa-free as a citizen of a Commonwealth country |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 14 days | Must apply in advance through the Pitcairn Islands Government Office and provide proof of onward travel |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 14 days | Must apply in advance through the Pitcairn Islands Government Office and provide proof of onward travel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** To visit the Pitcairn Islands as a tourist, you will need to apply for a tourist visa in advance.
