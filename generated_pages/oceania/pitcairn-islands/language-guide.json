  "content": "The official language spoken in Pitcairn Islands is English, and it is widely understood by the population of around 35 residents.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): English\nWidely Spoken: Pitkern, a creole language\nEnglish Proficiency: High\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Germanic, with influences from Polynesian languages\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Pitcairn Islands have a unique linguistic landscape, with English being the primary language used for official purposes and everyday communication. However, the residents also speak Pitkern, a creole language that emerged as a result of the interactions between the British mutineers and the Polynesian women who settled on the island in the late 18th century. Pitkern is a distinctive language that combines elements from English, Tahitian, and other Pacific languages. Despite its small population, the Pitcairn Islands have a relatively high level of English proficiency, making it easy for visitors to communicate with the locals.\n\nThe use of English is widespread, and it is the language used in government, education, and tourism. However, Pitkern remains an important part of the island's cultural heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote its use. Visitors to the island may hear Pitkern being spoken, especially among the older residents, and may even have the opportunity to learn some basic phrases.\n\nThe linguistic landscape of the Pitcairn Islands is also influenced by the island's history and geography. The island's isolation and small population have contributed to the development of a unique dialect and vocabulary, with words and phrases that are not found in standard English. Despite these differences, English remains the dominant language, and visitors who speak English will have no difficulty communicating with the locals.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Wha' sup | WA sup | informal |\n| Thank you | Ki ora | KEE oh-rah | formal |\n| Please | Ples | PLEZ | polite |\n| Yes / No | Aye / Nay | AY / NAY | formal |\n| Excuse me | Skuse me | SKOO-zee meh | polite |\n| How much? | Ha' mach | HAH mach | asking price |\n| Where is...? | Weh deh... | WEH deh | asking location |\n| I don't understand | Mi no savee | MEE no SA-vee | asking for clarification |\n| Do you speak English? | Yu tok English? | YOO tok ING-lish | asking for language |\n| Help! | Hep! | HEP | emergency |\n| Goodbye | Gudba' | GOO-bah | informal |\n| Sorry | Sori | SOH-ree | apology |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Wan | WAHN |\n| 2 | Tu | TOO |\n| 3 | Tri | TREE |\n| 4 | Fo' | FOH |\n| 5 | Faiv | FAYV |\n| 6 | Sikis | SEE-kis |\n| 7 | Sebin | SEH-bin |\n| 8 | Eit | AYT |\n| 9 | Nain | NAYN |\n| 10 | Ten | TEN |\n| 100 | Wan hanred | WAHN HAHN-red |\n| 1000 | Tu thousand | TOO THOW-zand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when interacting with the locals, using phrases like \"please\" and \"thank you\".\n- Use a formal tone when speaking to older residents or in formal situations.\n- Avoid using slang or colloquialisms, as they may not be understood by the locals.\n- Be patient and listen carefully, as the Pitkern language can be challenging to understand for non-native speakers.\n- Use body language and gestures to convey meaning, but avoid pointing or using aggressive gestures.\n- Learn some basic Pitkern phrases to show respect for the local culture and language.\n- Ask for help or clarification if you do not understand something, and do not be afraid to ask for repetition or explanation.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The **Pitcairn Island Government** website provides some basic language resources and phrases for visitors.\n- The **Pitkern Language Dictionary** is a valuable resource for learning the Pitkern language and understanding its grammar and vocabulary.\n- **Google Translate** can be useful for translating basic phrases and words, but may not always provide accurate translations for Pitkern.\n- Visitors can also ask locals for help with translation or interpretation, especially in formal situations or when dealing with official matters.\n- Learning a few basic Pitkern phrases before visiting the island can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and language.",
