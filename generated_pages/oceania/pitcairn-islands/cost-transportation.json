  "content": "The cost of transportation in Pitcairn Islands is relatively high due to the remote location and limited options, with a monthly transit pass not being available and a taxi start rate of around $10 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: (Not Available)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($10 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($2.50 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (No)\nCurrency: NZD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Pitcairn Islands are a remote territory in the Pacific Ocean, and as such, the transportation options are limited. The main mode of transportation is by boat, with the island's supply ship, the Claymore II, being the primary means of transportation to and from the island. Within the island, most people get around on foot or by using the island's limited number of vehicles, which are mostly four-wheel drive trucks and quad bikes. The quality of public transit is not applicable, as there is no public transportation system in place.\n\nThe island's rugged terrain and limited infrastructure make it difficult to get around, and the lack of public transportation means that most people rely on their own vehicles or walk to get where they need to go. The island's residents are a close-knit community, and it is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride with their neighbors or friends to get around the island. The island's government also provides some transportation services, including a boat service to and from the island's outer islands.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly used for transporting goods |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $10 | $2-$5 | $20-$50 | Limited availability, mostly used for transporting tourists |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $50-$100 | To and from the island's airport, which is mostly used for charter flights |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $2.50 | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $2.50 | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $100-$200 | Limited availability, mostly used for tourists |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | Free | Limited parking options, mostly free |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, no toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus | N/A | Not available |\n| Domestic Flight | $500-$1,000 | Charter flights to and from Mangareva, French Polynesia |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best way to get around the island is on foot or by using a four-wheel drive vehicle, as the terrain can be rugged and unforgiving.\n- It is recommended to book transportation services in advance, as options are limited and may not be available at short notice.\n- The island's supply ship, the Claymore II, is the primary means of transportation to and from the island, and it is recommended to book a spot on the ship well in advance.\n- The island's residents are friendly and welcoming, and it is not uncommon for tourists to hitch a ride with locals to get around the island.\n- It is recommended to bring a good map and compass, as well as a means of communication, such as a satellite phone, as the island's infrastructure is limited.\n- The island's government provides some transportation services, including a boat service to and from the island's outer islands, and it is recommended to check with the government for information on these services.",
