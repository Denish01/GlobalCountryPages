[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The Pitcairn Islands have a moderate visa policy, with a limited number of countries having visa-free access. The islands are a British Overseas Territory, and as such, the visa policy is closely tied to that of the United Kingdom. However, due to the remote location and limited accessibility of the islands, the visa requirements are more restrictive than those of the UK. Citizens of certain countries, including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, can enter the Pitcairn Islands without a visa, while others will need to apply for a visa in advance.

The visa policy of the Pitcairn Islands is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate tourism and other legitimate travel to the islands. The government of the Pitcairn Islands has implemented a range of measures to ensure that visitors are properly screened and that the islands' unique environment and culture are protected. As a result, visitors can expect a rigorous application process and strict entry requirements.
