  "content": "The Pitcairn Islands are governed as a **British Overseas Territory**, with a unique system of government that combines elements of democracy and traditional leadership.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Constitutional Monarchy\nHead of State: King Charles III, represented by the Governor of the Pitcairn Islands\nHead of Government: Mayor of Adamstown, currently Charlene Warren-Peu\nLegislature: Island Council, 10 seats (8 elected, 1 ex-officio, 1 appointed)\nLegal System: Common law, based on the laws of New Zealand\nPolitical Stability Index: 1.5 (low to moderate, based on limited data)\nCorruption Index: Not ranked (due to small population and limited economic activity)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe Pitcairn Islands have a **unitary system** of government, with the Island Council serving as the sole legislative body. The Council is composed of 10 members, including 8 elected representatives, 1 ex-officio member (the Mayor of Adamstown), and 1 appointed member (the Governor's representative). The Island Council is responsible for making laws and overseeing the administration of the island. The **separation of powers** is not strictly defined, as the Executive and Legislative branches are not entirely separate. However, the Governor of the Pitcairn Islands, who represents the British monarch, serves as the head of state and has certain reserve powers.\n\nThe Pitcairn Islands' government is also influenced by traditional leadership and community involvement. The **Mayor of Adamstown** serves as the head of government and is responsible for chairing the Island Council. Decision-making is often a collaborative process, involving community leaders and representatives. The island's small population and close-knit community contribute to a unique system of governance that blends formal and informal structures.\n\nThe Pitcairn Islands' political system is also shaped by its relationship with the **United Kingdom**. As a British Overseas Territory, the island is subject to the British monarch's authority, and the Governor of the Pitcairn Islands represents the monarch on the island. However, the island has a significant degree of autonomy, with the Island Council responsible for most domestic matters.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Island Council | Mayor of Adamstown (Charlene Warren-Peu) | Head of government, chairs Island Council |\n| Legislative | Island Council | Mayor of Adamstown (Charlene Warren-Peu) | Makes laws, oversees administration |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of the Pitcairn Islands | Chief Justice (appointed by the Governor) | Interprets laws, resolves disputes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\nThere are no formal **political parties** on the Pitcairn Islands, as the island's small population and unique system of governance make party politics impractical.
