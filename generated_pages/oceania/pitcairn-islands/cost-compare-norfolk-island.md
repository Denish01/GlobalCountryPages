[SECTION] Overview: Pitcairn Islands vs Norfolk Island [/SECTION]
The Pitcairn Islands and Norfolk Island are both remote territories in the Pacific Ocean, but they have distinct economic contexts. The Pitcairn Islands, with a population of just 35 people, have a limited economy that relies heavily on subsistence farming and external aid. In contrast, Norfolk Island has a more developed economy, with a population of around 2,000 people and a mix of tourism, fishing, and agriculture. As a result, the cost of living on the Pitcairn Islands is generally higher, due to the challenges of transporting goods and services to such a remote location.

The cost of living on the Pitcairn Islands is around 20-30% higher than on Norfolk Island, reflecting the difficulties of accessing goods and services in such a remote location. However, both territories have a relatively high cost of living compared to other countries in the region, due to their isolation and limited economic development. For example, the cost of groceries and other essential items is higher on both islands than in larger cities, due to the need to import goods from elsewhere. Despite these challenges, both territories offer a unique and attractive lifestyle for those who value peace, quiet, and a strong sense of community.
