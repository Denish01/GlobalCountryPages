  "content": "The Pitcairn Islands have limited internet connectivity, with options mainly available through satellite connections and a single mobile network carrier, making it a challenging destination for those reliant on high-speed internet.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 2 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Poor\nMain Carriers: Pitcairn Island Telecom\nSIM Card Cost: 20 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet quality in the Pitcairn Islands is generally poor, with slow speeds and limited availability. The island's remote location and small population make it difficult to establish and maintain high-speed internet infrastructure. The urban vs rural divide is not a significant issue, as the island's population is concentrated in Adamstown, the capital. However, the reliability of the internet connection can be a problem, with frequent outages and disruptions due to weather conditions and satellite connectivity issues.\n\nThe government and local authorities have made efforts to improve internet connectivity, but the progress has been slow. The island's internet service provider, Pitcairn Island Telecom, offers limited internet plans with slow speeds, making it challenging for residents and visitors to stay connected. The lack of competition and limited infrastructure contribute to the high cost of internet services, making it inaccessible to many.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in the Pitcairn Islands, visitors can purchase one from the Pitcairn Island Telecom office in Adamstown. The process is relatively straightforward, and visitors will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 20 USD, and it comes with a limited data plan. The recommended carrier is Pitcairn Island Telecom, as it is the only mobile network provider on the island.\n\nVisitors can choose from a range of data plans, including prepaid and postpaid options. The data plans are limited, and the speeds are slow, but they can be sufficient for basic internet browsing and communication. It is essential to note that the SIM card may not work outside of the Pitcairn Islands, and roaming services are not available.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pitcairn Island Telecom | Prepaid | 100 MB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Pitcairn Island Telecom | Postpaid | 500 MB | 20 | Monthly subscription |\n| Pitcairn Island Telecom | Data Add-on | 1 GB | 30 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Pitcairn Island Telecom | Voice and Data | 100 minutes and 100 MB | 40 | Monthly subscription |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally poor, with slow speeds and limited availability.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is non-existent, as there are no cafes on the island.\n- Coworking spaces are not available, and visitors will need to rely on their accommodation or the local telecom office for internet access.\n- Public WiFi is not available, and visitors will need to use their mobile data or purchase a prepaid SIM card.\n- Some government offices and community centers may offer limited WiFi access, but it is not reliable.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are not available, and remote workers will need to rely on their accommodation or the local telecom office for internet access.\n- Reliable cafe chains are not available, and remote workers will need to bring their own equipment and internet connectivity.\n- Backup internet options are limited, and remote workers may need to rely on satellite connections or mobile data.\n- VPN needs are essential, as the island's internet connection may not be secure.\n- Remote workers should consider purchasing a local SIM card or prepaid data plan to stay connected.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a significant issue, but the island's internet connection may be monitored by the local authorities.\n- Blocked sites are not common, but some websites may not be accessible due to the island's limited internet infrastructure.\n- VPN recommendations include using a reputable VPN provider to ensure secure and private internet browsing.\n- Roaming alternatives are not available, and visitors will need to purchase a local SIM card or prepaid data plan to stay connected.\n- eSIM options are not available, and visitors will need to use a physical SIM card or purchase a prepaid data plan.\n- Visitors should be aware of the island's limited internet connectivity and plan accordingly to avoid any disruptions to their work or communication.",
