  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Pitcairn Islands can be relatively high due to the remote location and limited infrastructure, with a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment averaging around $200-$300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($250 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($100 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($50 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.50 per kWh)\nCurrency: NZD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Pitcairn Islands have a basic utility infrastructure, with electricity, water, and garbage collection available, but the quality and reliability of these services can be affected by the remote location and limited resources. The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher costs during the peak summer months (December to February) when tourism is at its highest. The island's government and council work to maintain a stable and affordable cost of living, but the remote location and limited economy can lead to price increases.\n\nThe utility costs on the Pitcairn Islands are generally stable, but can be affected by external factors such as global fuel prices and shipping costs. The island's council and government work to subsidize the cost of utilities and maintain a stable cost of living, but the remote location and limited economy can lead to price increases. The cost of utilities can also vary depending on the location and size of the property, with larger properties and those in more remote areas tend to have higher utility costs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | Not available |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | Included in council rates |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$165** | **$210** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\nThe Pitcairn Islands have limited internet and phone options, with only a few providers offering services.
