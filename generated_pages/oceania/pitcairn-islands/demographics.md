[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The Pitcairn Islands have a tiny population, with the latest estimates suggesting around 35 residents, making it one of the smallest populations in the world. The population has been declining over the years, with a negative growth rate of approximately -4% due to a combination of factors, including low fertility rates and limited job opportunities. The islands' remote location and lack of economic opportunities have led to a steady decline in population, with many young people leaving to pursue education and career opportunities elsewhere. The urban population is 100%, as the entire population resides in the capital, Adamstown, which is the only settlement on the island.

The population of the Pitcairn Islands is also characterized by a high median age, with approximately 55 years, indicating an aging population. This has significant implications for the islands' economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is nearing retirement age. The population density is very low, with only 0.74 people per square kilometer, making it one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world. The life expectancy is around 75 years, which is relatively high compared to other small island nations.

The Pitcairn Islands' population has been shaped by its history, with the descendants of the **Bounty** mutineers and their Polynesian companions forming the core of the population. The islands' isolation has helped preserve a unique cultural identity, with a strong sense of community and shared history. However, the declining population and limited economic opportunities pose significant challenges to the long-term sustainability of the community.
