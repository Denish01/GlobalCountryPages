However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The territory's remote location and limited resources also contribute to higher utility costs compared to other parts of the United States.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Northern Mariana Islands is generally stable, with occasional increases in electricity and water rates. The Commonwealth Utilities Corporation (CUC) is the main provider of electricity, water, and wastewater services, and it offers various payment plans and assistance programs to help residents manage their utility bills. However, the territory's vulnerability to natural disasters such as typhoons can disrupt utility services and impact costs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | not commonly used |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$165** | **$240** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10-20 Mbps | IT&E, Docomo Pacific |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 50-100 Mbps | IT&E, Docomo Pacific |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | IT&E, Docomo Pacific |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | IT&E, Docomo Pacific |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $100-150 | varies | IT&E, Docomo Pacific |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $13.99 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $9.99 | |\n| Local Streaming | $0 | (not available) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents typically need to provide identification, proof of address, and a security deposit to the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation (CUC) or other service providers.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available for residents who want to manage their energy usage and costs more closely.\n- IT&E and Docomo Pacific are the main internet and phone service providers in Northern Mariana Islands, offering a range of plans and bundles.\n- Residents can save on their utility bills by using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and taking advantage of CUC's energy conservation programs. \n- It is also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure the best rates and services are being used.",
