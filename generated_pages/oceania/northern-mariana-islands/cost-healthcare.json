  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Northern Mariana Islands varies depending on the type of service and provider, with public healthcare services generally being more affordable than private ones, and insurance costs ranging from $100 to $500 per month for basic to comprehensive coverage.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: 1,041 USD (according to World Bank, 2019)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 34.6% (according to World Bank, 2019)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Northern Mariana Islands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, but the quality of care can be variable, with some public hospitals and clinics being understaffed and underfunded. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary option, while foreigners and expats may prefer to use private healthcare services. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.\n\nThe healthcare system in the Northern Mariana Islands is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, with many healthcare professionals and medical supplies being imported from the US. This can result in higher costs for certain medical services and procedures. Additionally, the islands' remote location can make it difficult to access specialized medical care, and patients may need to be evacuated to Guam or the US mainland for certain treatments. Overall, the healthcare system in the Northern Mariana Islands is complex and can be challenging to navigate, especially for foreigners and expats.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | 20-50 | 50-100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | 50-100 | 100-200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | 30-70 | 70-150 | |\n| Eye Exam | 20-50 | 50-100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | 10-30 | 30-50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | 100-300 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | 200-500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | 1,000-3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | 2,000-5,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | 500-1,000 | |\n| X-Ray | 50-100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | 100-200 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | 300-500 | Specialist consultations, surgeries, diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | 500-1,000 | Global coverage, evacuation services, advanced medical procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications like **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between 10-30 USD per prescription\n- **Prescription rules** require a doctor's prescription for most medications, but some pharmacies may offer over-the-counter options\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good, with several pharmacies located in Saipan and other major towns\n- **Over-the-counter norms** allow for the purchase of basic medications like **cold and flu remedies** and **allergy medications** without a prescription\n- **Medication prices** can vary depending on the pharmacy and location, with prices tend to be higher in remote areas\n- **Health supplements** and **vitamins** are also widely available, but may not be covered by insurance\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call 911 or visit the emergency room at the Commonwealth Health Center in Saipan.

For foreigners and expats, it is recommended to have a **private health insurance plan** that covers emergency medical evacuation to Guam or the US mainland, as the Northern Mariana Islands may not have the necessary medical facilities to treat complex or critical conditions.
