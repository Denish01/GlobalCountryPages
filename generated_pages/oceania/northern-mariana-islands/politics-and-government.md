[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of the Northern Mariana Islands is a constitutional democracy, with three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The Covenant Agreement, which came into effect in 1986, established the islands' relationship with the US and provides for a significant degree of autonomy in local affairs. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected by popular vote for a four-year term, while the legislature is composed of 20 members, also elected by popular vote. The islands' **separation of powers** is designed to provide checks and balances on each branch of government, ensuring that no one branch has too much authority.

The government of the Northern Mariana Islands is also subject to the authority of the US federal government, which has jurisdiction over matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and immigration. The islands' **unitary system** means that the central government has a significant degree of control over local affairs, although the Covenant Agreement provides for a degree of autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.

The Northern Mariana Islands' political system is designed to promote **representative democracy**, with elected officials accountable to the people. The islands' **electoral system** is based on a simple plurality system, with the candidate receiving the most votes winning the election. The government is also subject to the **rule of law**, with an independent judiciary that interprets the islands' laws and ensures that the government acts in accordance with the Constitution.
