While internet speeds are not exceptionally fast, they are generally sufficient for basic browsing, social media, and streaming. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in the capital city of Saipan, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Northern Mariana Islands is also affected by the territory's vulnerability to natural disasters, such as typhoons, which can cause power outages and damage to infrastructure. Additionally, the islands' remote location can make it difficult to maintain and upgrade internet infrastructure, which can lead to occasional outages and slow speeds. Despite these challenges, the main carriers have made efforts to improve their networks and provide more reliable services, making it possible for residents and tourists to stay connected.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Northern Mariana Islands is relatively straightforward, with several carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. IT&E and Docomo Pacific are two of the main carriers, and they offer a range of plans with varying data allowances and prices. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will typically need to provide a valid passport and may need to show proof of address or a hotel reservation. SIM cards can be purchased at carrier stores, airports, or some retail outlets.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| IT&E | Prepaid | 1GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Docomo Pacific | Tourist Plan | 3GB | 20 | Valid for 14 days |\n| GTA | Visitor Plan | 5GB | 30 | Valid for 30 days |\n| IT&E | Data Add-on | 10GB | 50 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi is generally available and of decent quality, with many hotels offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not as prevalent as in other countries, but some cafes and restaurants do offer free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are limited, but some are available in Saipan, offering reliable WiFi and other amenities\n- Public WiFi is available in some areas, such as the Saipan airport and some public parks\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi to customers, making it relatively easy to stay connected while out and about\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like the Saipan Coworking Space offer reliable WiFi and other amenities, making them a good option for remote workers\n- Cafe chains like The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots or portable WiFi devices can be useful in case of outages or slow speeds\n- VPNs may be necessary to access certain websites or services that are blocked in the Northern Mariana Islands\n- Some hotels and resorts also offer coworking spaces or business centers with reliable WiFi and other amenities\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major issue in the Northern Mariana Islands, but some websites or services may be blocked\n- Using a **VPN** can help to access blocked websites and protect online privacy\n- Roaming alternatives like eSIMs or portable WiFi devices can be a convenient option for travelers\n- Be aware of **data limits** and **roaming charges** when using mobile data, as they can be expensive\n- Regular **power outages** can affect internet availability, so it's a good idea to have a backup plan, such as a portable power bank or a mobile hotspot\n- **Cybersecurity** is an important consideration when using public WiFi or accessing sensitive information online, so be sure to use strong passwords and keep software up to date.",
