The cost of food in the islands is generally higher than in other parts of the world due to its remote location and reliance on imports. The majority of food products are shipped from the United States, Japan, and other countries, which drives up prices. However, the local economy is also influenced by the tourism industry, which supports a range of restaurants and food establishments catering to visitors. Eating out is a popular activity in the Northern Mariana Islands, with many restaurants offering a mix of local, Asian, and Western cuisine. However, home cooking is also common, especially among locals who prefer to prepare traditional dishes using fresh seafood, meats, and produce.\n\nThe high cost of living in the Northern Mariana Islands is also reflected in the prices of groceries and dining out. The islands' remote location and limited agricultural production mean that many food products are imported, which increases their cost. Additionally, the tourism industry drives up demand for certain products, such as fresh seafood and high-end meats, which can also increase prices. However, locals and visitors can find affordable options by eating at local eateries, buying fresh produce at markets, and preparing meals at home. The Northern Mariana Islands' food culture is a unique blend of traditional and modern influences, with popular dishes such as **kelaguen** (a raw fish dish), **tinaktak** (a meat dish), and **apigigi** (a type of breadfruit).\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $3.50 | 3.50 USD | Imported from the US |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.50 | 2.50 USD | Local bakery products |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.20 | 2.20 USD | Imported from the US |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.80 | 1.80 USD | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.50 | 6.50 USD | Imported from the US |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 10.00 USD | Imported from the US |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 5.00 USD | Imported from the US |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3.00 | 3.00 USD | Local produce |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2.00 | 2.00 USD | Local produce |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.50 | 1.50 USD | Local produce |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 8.00 USD | Made from local milk |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.50 | 1.50 USD | Local brand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | (kelaguen, tinaktak, etc.) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | (one person, local cuisine) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | (3 courses, international cuisine) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$120 | (upscale, seafood, etc.) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $6-$8 | (at a bar or restaurant) |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$10 | (at a bar or restaurant) |\n| Cappuccino | $4-$6 | (at a café) |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | (at a convenience store) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries and other products can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in the Northern Mariana Islands. Supermarkets, such as those found in Saipan and other major towns, tend to carry a wide range of imported products, including fresh produce, meats, and dairy products. However, these products are often more expensive than those found at local markets, which specialize in fresh seafood, local produce, and traditional products. At local markets, visitors can find unique products such as **fresh fish**, **coconuts**, and **local handicrafts**. The prices at local markets are often lower than those at supermarkets, but the selection may be limited.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's essential to **bargain** and **negotiate prices**, especially for fresh produce and handicrafts. Vendors often expect customers to haggle, and it's a common practice in the Northern Mariana Islands. Visitors can also find unique products and souvenirs at local markets, such as **wood carvings**, **shell jewelry**, and **traditional clothing**. To get the best value, it's recommended to visit local markets early in the morning, when the selection is fresh and the prices are lower. Supermarkets, on the other hand, offer a wider range of products and fixed prices, making them a more convenient option for visitors who prefer to shop in a more traditional setting.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries and food trucks is a great way to experience the unique flavors of the Northern Mariana Islands at an affordable price.\n- **Fresh seafood** is a staple in the local diet and can be found at many restaurants and markets at a lower cost than imported meats.\n- **Local produce**, such as **coconuts**, **bananas**, and **taro**, is widely available and often cheaper than imported fruits and vegetables.\n- **Traditional dishes**, such as **kelaguen** and **tinaktak**, are often made with local ingredients and can be found at restaurants and markets at a lower cost than international cuisine.\n- **Avoid buying imported products**, such as **meat** and **dairy products**, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- **Visit local markets** to find unique products and souvenirs, and to experience the local culture and cuisine.",
