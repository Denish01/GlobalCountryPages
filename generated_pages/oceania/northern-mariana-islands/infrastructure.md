# Northern Mariana Islands Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Northern Mariana Islands is relatively developed, with a focus on improving **transportation**, **energy**, and **telecommunications** systems, but still faces challenges in providing reliable services to the entire population, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 90% of population
Internet Penetration: 30%
Road Network: 362 km, moderate quality with some paved and unpaved roads
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 3
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands, a territory of the United States, has a relatively small but growing infrastructure base. Recent investments have focused on improving the **transportation** sector, including the upgrade of roads and airports. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with the latter often lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of renewable energy sources and the expansion of telecommunications services.

The territory's infrastructure development is also influenced by its geographic location, with the islands being prone to natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes. As a result, there is a need for **disaster-resistant** infrastructure that can withstand these events. The government has been working to improve the resilience of its infrastructure, including the construction of sea walls and the implementation of early warning systems.

Overall, the infrastructure in Northern Mariana Islands is still in the process of development, with a focus on improving the quality of services and expanding access to rural areas. The government has been working to attract investment and funding from various sources, including the United States federal government and international organizations.
