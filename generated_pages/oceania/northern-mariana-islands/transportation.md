[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands are accessible by air, with the main international airports being Francisco C. Ada/Saipan International Airport, Rota International Airport, and Tinian International Airport. These airports receive direct flights from Guam, which is a major hub for flights to and from the United States, Japan, and other Asian destinations. There are no overland entry points to the Northern Mariana Islands, as they are a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. To get to the Northern Mariana Islands, visitors typically fly into one of the international airports and then take a taxi or rental car to their destination.

The main airlines that operate flights to the Northern Mariana Islands are United Airlines, Japan Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, although there may be other airlines that offer flights depending on the time of year and demand. Visitors can also fly into Guam and then take a connecting flight to the Northern Mariana Islands. It's a good idea to book flights in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and to get the best prices.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The domestic air network in the Northern Mariana Islands is limited, with only a few flights per week between the main islands of Saipan, Rota, and Tinian. The main airline that operates domestic flights is Star Marianas Air, which offers flights between the islands. Flights can be booked online or through a local travel agent, and prices vary depending on the time of year and demand. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200 per person, depending on the route and time of booking.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in the Northern Mariana Islands, so visitors will need to rely on other forms of transportation to get around. This can be a challenge, especially for those who are used to having access to trains and subways in other parts of the world. However, the lack of a rail network also means that the roads are generally less congested, making it easier to get around by car or taxi.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are public buses available on the main island of Saipan, which operate on a limited schedule and route. The buses are a affordable way to get around, with fares starting at around $1 per ride. However, the buses may not be as frequent or convenient as other forms of transportation, such as taxis or rental cars. There are also private bus companies that offer charter services for groups, which can be a good option for those who want to explore the island with a group of people.
