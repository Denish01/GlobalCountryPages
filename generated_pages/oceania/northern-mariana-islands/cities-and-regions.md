[SECTION] How Northern Mariana Islands Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States, located in the Pacific Ocean, and is divided into four municipalities: Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and the Northern Islands. Each municipality has its own local government and is responsible for providing various services to its residents. The capital, Saipan, is the most populated municipality and serves as the economic and cultural hub of the islands. The other municipalities, Tinian and Rota, are smaller and more rural, with a stronger focus on agriculture and tourism.

The Northern Islands, which include the islands of Anatahan, Sarigan, and Farallon de Pajaros, are uninhabited and are primarily used for conservation and research purposes.
