[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, but the quality of care can be variable, with some public hospitals and clinics being understaffed and underfunded. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary option, while foreigners and expats may prefer to use private healthcare services. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.

The healthcare system in the Northern Mariana Islands is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, with many healthcare professionals and medical supplies being imported from the US. This can result in higher costs for certain medical services and procedures. Additionally, the islands' remote location can make it difficult to access specialized medical care, and patients may need to be evacuated to Guam or the US mainland for certain treatments. Overall, the healthcare system in the Northern Mariana Islands is complex and can be challenging to navigate, especially for foreigners and expats.
