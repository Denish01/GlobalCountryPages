  "content": "Getting around in Northern Mariana Islands is relatively easy, with a range of transportation options available, including taxis, rental cars, and public buses, although the lack of a rail network and limited domestic air network may require some planning.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Francisco C. Ada/Saipan International Airport, Rota International Airport, Tinian International Airport (SPN, ROP, TIQ)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe Northern Mariana Islands are accessible by air, with the main international airports being Francisco C. Ada/Saipan International Airport, Rota International Airport, and Tinian International Airport. These airports receive direct flights from Guam, which is a major hub for flights to and from the United States, Japan, and other Asian destinations. There are no overland entry points to the Northern Mariana Islands, as they are a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. To get to the Northern Mariana Islands, visitors typically fly into one of the international airports and then take a taxi or rental car to their destination.\n\nThe main airlines that operate flights to the Northern Mariana Islands are United Airlines, Japan Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, although there may be other airlines that offer flights depending on the time of year and demand. Visitors can also fly into Guam and then take a connecting flight to the Northern Mariana Islands. It's a good idea to book flights in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and to get the best prices.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in the Northern Mariana Islands is limited, with only a few flights per week between the main islands of Saipan, Rota, and Tinian. The main airline that operates domestic flights is Star Marianas Air, which offers flights between the islands. Flights can be booked online or through a local travel agent, and prices vary depending on the time of year and demand. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200 per person, depending on the route and time of booking.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in the Northern Mariana Islands, so visitors will need to rely on other forms of transportation to get around. This can be a challenge, especially for those who are used to having access to trains and subways in other parts of the world. However, the lack of a rail network also means that the roads are generally less congested, making it easier to get around by car or taxi.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThere are public buses available on the main island of Saipan, which operate on a limited schedule and route. The buses are a affordable way to get around, with fares starting at around $1 per ride. However, the buses may not be as frequent or convenient as other forms of transportation, such as taxis or rental cars. There are also private bus companies that offer charter services for groups, which can be a good option for those who want to explore the island with a group of people.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Saipan | $1 | Limited schedule and route |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10 | Metered fares |\n| Ride-Hailing | Saipan | $5-$10 | Local alternatives |\n| Car Rental | Everywhere | $40-$60 per day | Economy cars available |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in the Northern Mariana Islands, visitors will need to have a valid driver's license from their home country or an international driver's license.\n- The roads in the Northern Mariana Islands are generally in moderate condition, with some paved roads and some unpaved roads, especially on the outer islands.\n- Fuel costs are generally higher in the Northern Mariana Islands than in the United States, due to the remote location of the islands.\n- Car rental companies are available at the airports and in the main towns, and offer a range of vehicles, including economy cars, SUVs, and vans.\n- Visitors should be aware of the **speed limits** and **traffic laws** in the Northern Mariana Islands, which are generally similar to those in the United States.\n- Hazards on the road can include **potholes**, **narrow roads**, and **limited lighting**, especially at night.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced taxi fares or fake tour operators.\n- Use **credit cards** or **cash** to pay for transportation, as not all providers may accept other forms of payment.\n- Download **local apps**, such as taxi-hailing apps or maps, to help navigate the islands.\n- Be **patient** and **flexible** when traveling, as transportation options may be limited and schedules may change.\n- Consider **renting a car** for the duration of your stay, as this can be a convenient and cost-effective way to get around.\n- Always **wear a seatbelt** and follow **traffic laws** to ensure your safety on the road.\n- Be aware of **road closures** and **construction**, which can affect traffic and transportation options.",
