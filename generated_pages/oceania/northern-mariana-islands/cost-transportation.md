[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean, has a relatively simple transportation system. The main modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and rental cars, with most people relying on personal vehicles or taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is limited, with a lack of comprehensive bus networks and no metro or subway system. However, the islands' small size and low population density make it relatively easy to navigate, and many residents and tourists opt for walking or biking for short distances.

The capital city of Saipan has a more developed transportation system, with a few bus routes and a greater number of taxis available. However, outside of Saipan, transportation options are more limited, and visitors may need to rely on rental cars or private transfers to get around. Despite these limitations, the Northern Mariana Islands are a popular tourist destination, and many resorts and hotels offer shuttle services or car rentals to help visitors get around.
