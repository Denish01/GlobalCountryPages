[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands have a relatively well-developed internet infrastructure, with a mix of fiber-optic and cellular networks providing coverage across the main islands of Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. While internet speeds are not exceptionally fast, they are generally sufficient for basic browsing, social media, and streaming. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in the capital city of Saipan, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages.

The reliability of the internet in Northern Mariana Islands is also affected by the territory's vulnerability to natural disasters, such as typhoons, which can cause power outages and damage to infrastructure. Additionally, the islands' remote location can make it difficult to maintain and upgrade internet infrastructure, which can lead to occasional outages and slow speeds. Despite these challenges, the main carriers have made efforts to improve their networks and provide more reliable services, making it possible for residents and tourists to stay connected.

Getting a SIM card in Northern Mariana Islands is relatively straightforward, with several carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. IT&E and Docomo Pacific are two of the main carriers, and they offer a range of plans with varying data allowances and prices. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will typically need to provide a valid passport and may need to show proof of address or a hotel reservation. SIM cards can be purchased at carrier stores, airports, or some retail outlets.
