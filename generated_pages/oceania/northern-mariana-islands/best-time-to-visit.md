# Best Time to Visit Northern Mariana Islands — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit the Northern Mariana Islands is during the dry season, from December to June, when the weather is sunny and dry, making it ideal for outdoor activities and water sports. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Northern Mariana Islands: December to June. Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: September to November due to the risk of typhoons. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands have a tropical marine climate, with two distinct seasons: a dry season from December to June and a wet season from July to November. The dry season is characterized by sunny weather, low humidity, and gentle trade winds, making it the best time to visit the islands. The wet season, on the other hand, is marked by increased rainfall, higher humidity, and a higher risk of typhoons. The climate is warm and sunny year-round, with average temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C). The islands' location in the Pacific Ocean means that they are susceptible to typhoons, which can bring strong winds and heavy rainfall.

The dry season is the peak tourist season, with many visitors flocking to the islands to enjoy the beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and hiking. The wet season, while less popular with tourists, can still be a good time to visit if you're looking for lower prices and fewer crowds. However, it's essential to be aware of the risk of typhoons and to plan accordingly.

The seasons can affect travel to the Northern Mariana Islands in various ways. During the dry season, the roads are dry and easy to navigate, and the beaches are clean and safe. In contrast, the wet season can make the roads slippery and difficult to navigate, and the beaches may be closed due to rough seas and strong currents. Additionally, some tourist facilities and attractions may be closed or operate on reduced hours during the wet season.
