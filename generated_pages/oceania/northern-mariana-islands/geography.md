The Northern Mariana Islands are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, with the Philippine Sea to the west and the open ocean to the north and east. The islands are geographically close to several countries, including Japan, the Philippines, and the Federated States of Micronesia, but their closest neighbor is the US territory of Guam, which lies about 120 miles to the south.

The Northern Mariana Islands are an archipelago of 14 islands, with the largest islands being Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. The islands are volcanic in origin, with steep coastlines and coral reefs surrounding them. The Northern Mariana Islands are part of the United States as a territory, with the capital city of Saipan serving as the administrative center. The islands have a strategic location in the Pacific, with a rich history of cultural and economic exchange with neighboring countries and the United States.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands are characterized by a diverse landscape of volcanic mountains, coral reefs, and white sandy beaches. The islands are volcanic in origin, with steep coastlines and rugged terrain. The highest point in the islands is Mount Agrihan, which rises to an elevation of 965 meters on the island of Agrihan. The islands are also home to several smaller mountains and hills, including the Kagman Peninsula on Saipan and the As Matos village on Rota. The terrain is generally rugged, with steep slopes and narrow valleys, making it challenging to develop infrastructure and transportation networks.

The coastal areas of the Northern Mariana Islands are characterized by coral reefs, white sandy beaches, and crystal-clear waters. The islands are surrounded by a coral reef system, which provides a habitat for a diverse array of marine life, including sea turtles, rays, and tropical fish. The beaches are generally narrow and steep, with strong currents and waves, making them popular for surfing and other water sports. The islands are also home to several freshwater lakes and streams, including the Lake Susupe on Saipan and the Talofofo River on Rota.

The forests of the Northern Mariana Islands are characterized by a diverse array of tropical tree species, including coconut palms, breadfruit trees, and pandanus trees. The forests are generally dense and lush, with a thick undergrowth of shrubs and vines. The forests provide a habitat for a variety of wildlife, including birds, bats, and reptiles, and are also an important source of timber and other forest products. However, the forests are under threat from deforestation and habitat destruction, which has resulted in the loss of several endemic species.
