The main modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and rental cars, with most people relying on personal vehicles or taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is limited, with a lack of comprehensive bus networks and no metro or subway system. However, the islands' small size and low population density make it relatively easy to navigate, and many residents and tourists opt for walking or biking for short distances.\n\nThe capital city of Saipan has a more developed transportation system, with a few bus routes and a greater number of taxis available. However, outside of Saipan, transportation options are more limited, and visitors may need to rely on rental cars or private transfers to get around. Despite these limitations, the Northern Mariana Islands are a popular tourist destination, and many resorts and hotels offer shuttle services or car rentals to help visitors get around.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $60 | Limited coverage, mostly in Saipan |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly in Saipan |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-20 | Limited availability outside Saipan |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available, but some local taxi apps |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-80 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-5 | Limited parking options, especially in Saipan |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, no toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-50 | Limited options, mostly between Saipan and other islands |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-200 | Typical route, depending on airline and time of year |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for $60, which can be used on buses and some taxis.\n- Use local taxi apps, such as **Saipan Taxi**, to book rides and estimate fares in advance.\n- Always negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, especially for longer trips or at night.\n- Be aware of limited parking options, especially in Saipan, and plan ahead to avoid fines or towing.\n- Consider renting a car for a day or two to explore the islands and enjoy more flexibility in your transportation.\n- For domestic flights, book in advance to secure the best prices, and consider traveling during the off-season to save money.",
