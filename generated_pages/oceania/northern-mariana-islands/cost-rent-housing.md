[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The housing market in Northern Mariana Islands is relatively small, with a limited supply of properties available for rent or purchase. The rental market is primarily driven by the tourism and hospitality industries, with many apartments and houses being rented out to short-term visitors. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the Northern Mariana Islands' landlord-tenant law, which provides for fair housing practices and dispute resolution. Compared to its regional neighbor, Guam, the housing costs in Northern Mariana Islands are relatively similar, with a slightly lower cost of living.

The housing market in Northern Mariana Islands is also influenced by the island's remote location and limited connectivity to the global market. As a result, the market is relatively isolated, and prices can be higher than in more connected regions. However, the island's natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly community make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists alike. The demand for housing is relatively high, particularly in the capital city of Saipan, which can drive up prices and reduce the availability of properties.
