[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands have a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most households having access to electricity, water, and garbage collection services. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The territory's remote location and limited resources also contribute to higher utility costs compared to other parts of the United States.

The cost of utilities in Northern Mariana Islands is generally stable, with occasional increases in electricity and water rates. The Commonwealth Utilities Corporation (CUC) is the main provider of electricity, water, and wastewater services, and it offers various payment plans and assistance programs to help residents manage their utility bills. However, the territory's vulnerability to natural disasters such as typhoons can disrupt utility services and impact costs.
