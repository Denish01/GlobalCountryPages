The cuisine of the Northern Mariana Islands is a reflection of the islands' rich cultural heritage, with influences from the indigenous Chamorro and Carolinian people, as well as from American, Japanese, and Spanish colonizers. The local diet is heavily based on seafood, with fish, shrimp, and lobster being staples in many dishes. The use of coconuts, breadfruit, and other tropical fruits and vegetables is also prevalent, adding a unique flavor and texture to many dishes. The islands' cuisine is known for its bold flavors and spices, with a focus on fresh, locally-sourced ingredients.
