The rental market is primarily driven by the tourism and hospitality industries, with many apartments and houses being rented out to short-term visitors. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the Northern Mariana Islands' landlord-tenant law, which provides for fair housing practices and dispute resolution. Compared to its regional neighbor, Guam, the housing costs in Northern Mariana Islands are relatively similar, with a slightly lower cost of living.\n\nThe housing market in Northern Mariana Islands is also influenced by the island's remote location and limited connectivity to the global market. As a result, the market is relatively isolated, and prices can be higher than in more connected regions. However, the island's natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly community make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists alike. The demand for housing is relatively high, particularly in the capital city of Saipan, which can drive up prices and reduce the availability of properties.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | 800-1,200 | 600-1,000 | small, basic units |\n| 1 Bedroom | 1,000-1,500 | 800-1,200 | standard apartments with kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | 1,200-2,000 | 1,000-1,600 | family-sized apartments with two bedrooms and two bathrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | 1,800-2,500 | 1,500-2,200 | spacious apartments with three bedrooms and two or three bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | 3,500-5,000 | prime locations with ocean views and amenities |\n| Suburbs | 2,500-3,500 | residential areas with easy access to schools and shops |\n| Rural | 1,500-2,500 | rural areas with limited amenities and infrastructure |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- San Antonio: a popular neighborhood in Saipan with a range of apartments and houses available for rent, priced from $1,000 to $2,000 per month\n- San Vicente: a family-friendly neighborhood with a mix of apartments and houses, priced from $800 to $1,800 per month\n- Garapan: a bustling neighborhood in the heart of Saipan, with a range of apartments and houses available for rent, priced from $1,200 to $2,500 per month\n- Chalan Kanoa: a quiet neighborhood with a mix of apartments and houses, priced from $600 to $1,200 per month\n- Susupe: a residential neighborhood with a range of apartments and houses available for rent, priced from $800 to $1,500 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Northern Mariana Islands [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and properties thoroughly before making a decision, taking into account factors such as proximity to work, schools, and amenities\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find properties and negotiate prices\n- Be prepared to pay a security deposit and first month's rent upfront\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and internet are usually not included in the rent, and tenants are responsible for setting up and paying for these services\n- Furnished apartments are available, but it's more common for properties to be rented unfurnished, so tenants may need to provide their own furniture and appliances\n- Be wary of scams and ensure that you are working with a legitimate landlord or property manager, and always inspect the property before signing a lease.",
