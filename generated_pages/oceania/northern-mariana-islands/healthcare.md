[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Northern Mariana Islands' healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation (CHCC) being the primary public healthcare provider. The CHCC operates a hospital and several clinics throughout the islands, offering a range of services including emergency care, surgical services, and outpatient clinics. The quality of care in the Northern Mariana Islands is generally good, with many healthcare providers having received training in the United States. However, the islands' remote location can make it difficult to access specialized care, and medical evacuation to Guam or the United States may be necessary in some cases. Urban areas, such as Saipan, tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be limited.

The government of the Northern Mariana Islands has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the construction of new healthcare facilities and the recruitment of additional healthcare personnel. Despite these efforts, the islands still face challenges in terms of healthcare access and quality, particularly in rural areas. The use of **telemedicine** has become more prevalent in recent years, helping to increase access to healthcare services, especially for those living in remote areas.

The Northern Mariana Islands' healthcare system is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, with many healthcare providers having received training in the US and many patients traveling to the US for specialized care. This relationship has helped to improve the quality of care in the islands, but it also presents challenges in terms of funding and resources.
