  "content": "Healthcare in the Northern Mariana Islands is a mixed system that provides access to both public and private facilities, with a relatively high quality of care, especially in the capital city of Saipan. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 911\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Northern Mariana Islands' healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation (CHCC) being the primary public healthcare provider. The CHCC operates a hospital and several clinics throughout the islands, offering a range of services including emergency care, surgical services, and outpatient clinics. The quality of care in the Northern Mariana Islands is generally good, with many healthcare providers having received training in the United States. However, the islands' remote location can make it difficult to access specialized care, and medical evacuation to Guam or the United States may be necessary in some cases. Urban areas, such as Saipan, tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be limited.\n\nThe government of the Northern Mariana Islands has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the construction of new healthcare facilities and the recruitment of additional healthcare personnel. Despite these efforts, the islands still face challenges in terms of healthcare access and quality, particularly in rural areas. The use of **telemedicine** has become more prevalent in recent years, helping to increase access to healthcare services, especially for those living in remote areas.\n\nThe Northern Mariana Islands' healthcare system is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, with many healthcare providers having received training in the US and many patients traveling to the US for specialized care. This relationship has helped to improve the quality of care in the islands, but it also presents challenges in terms of funding and resources.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation | Saipan | Hospital | Emergency, surgical, outpatient | Yes |\n| Saipan Health Clinic | Saipan | Clinic | Primary care, dental | Yes |\n| Rota Health Clinic | Rota | Clinic | Primary care, dental | Yes |\n| Tinian Health Clinic | Tinian | Clinic | Primary care, dental | Yes |\n| CHCC Behavioral Health | Saipan | Clinic | Mental health, substance abuse | Yes |\n| FHP Health Center | Saipan | Clinic | Primary care, specialty care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all residents and visitors to the Northern Mariana Islands, as it can help to cover the cost of medical care, including medical evacuation to Guam or the United States if necessary.\n- The **Affordable Care Act** (ACA) is available to residents of the Northern Mariana Islands, providing access to affordable health insurance.\n- **Medicare** and **Medicaid** are also available to eligible residents, providing access to healthcare services, including hospital care, physician services, and prescription medications.\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for visitors to the Northern Mariana Islands, as it can help to cover the cost of medical care, including medical evacuation, in the event of an emergency.\n- Local insurance options, such as the **Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation's** health insurance plan, are also available to residents.\n- The cost of health insurance in the Northern Mariana Islands can vary, depending on the type of insurance and the individual's circumstances, but it is generally comparable to the cost of health insurance in the United States.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in the Northern Mariana Islands, including at pharmacies and clinics.\n- A **prescription** is required for most medications, and can be obtained from a licensed healthcare provider.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including those from the United States and other countries.\n- The **cost of medications** can vary, depending on the type of medication and the individual's insurance coverage.\n- **Pharmacy access** is moderate, with several pharmacies located in Saipan and other islands, but may be limited in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to the Northern Mariana Islands.\n- **Typhoid** vaccination is also recommended, especially for those who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Influenza** vaccination is recommended for all individuals, especially during the flu season.\n- **Dengue fever** is a risk in the Northern Mariana Islands, and travelers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water or eating untreated seafood.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked or raw meat, seafood, or eggs.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- The Northern Mariana Islands are not a major destination for **medical tourism**, but some medical procedures, such as **dental care** and **cosmetic surgery**, may be available at a lower cost than in the United States.\n- **Accredited hospitals**, such as the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation, may offer certain medical procedures, including surgical services and outpatient care.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, especially for procedures such as dental care and cosmetic surgery.\n- However, **medical evacuation** to Guam or the United States may be necessary in some cases, which can increase the overall cost of care.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance service** is available, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** include the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation and the Saipan Health Clinic.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted to the insurance provider as soon as possible, and may require documentation from the healthcare provider.\n- **Medical evacuation** to Guam or the United States may be necessary in some cases, and can be arranged through the healthcare provider or insurance company.",
