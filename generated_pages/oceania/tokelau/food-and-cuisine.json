The territory's cuisine has been influenced by its historical ties with Samoa and other Pacific Island nations, resulting in a unique blend of flavors and cooking techniques. Tokelauan cuisine is characterized by its use of fresh seafood, coconut milk, and root vegetables, which are often combined to create flavorful and hearty dishes.

The cuisine is also influenced by the territory's Christian heritage, with many dishes being prepared for special occasions such as church gatherings and festivals. The use of coconut milk and cream is a distinctive feature of Tokelauan cuisine, adding richness and flavor to a variety of dishes.\n\nTokelau's food culture is also shaped by its close-knit community, with meals often being shared with family and friends. The traditional **Umaga**, or morning meal, is an important part of Tokelauan culture, where families gather together to share a meal and socialize.
