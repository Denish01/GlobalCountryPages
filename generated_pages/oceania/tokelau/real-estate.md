[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The real estate market in Tokelau is characterized by a severe shortage of available properties, largely due to the territory's small size and limited land area. The market is primarily driven by local demand, with most properties being passed down through generations or sold to other locals. The lack of infrastructure, limited access to financing, and restrictive foreign ownership rules further hinder the development of a robust property market. As a result, prices for available properties tend to be relatively high, especially in the capital Atafu. The price trajectory has been stable in recent years, with some fluctuations due to changes in the local economy. Urban areas, such as the villages in Atafu and Nukunonu, tend to have higher prices than rural areas, which are largely limited to small, traditional settlements.

The market is also influenced by the territory's **subsistence economy**, where many residents rely on fishing, farming, and other traditional activities for their livelihood. This has led to a strong emphasis on community and family ties, with properties often being passed down through generations or sold to other locals. The limited availability of modern amenities and services, such as electricity, water, and healthcare, also affects the property market, with many residents prioritizing access to these essential services when choosing a property.

Overall, the property market in Tokelau is highly localized and subject to unique cultural and economic factors. Foreigners looking to invest in the territory must navigate complex ownership rules and regulations, as well as the challenges of operating in a remote and isolated environment.
