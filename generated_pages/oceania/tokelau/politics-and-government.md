[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Tokelau's government is based on a system of **traditional leadership**, where each of the three atolls (Atafu, Fakaofo, and Nukunonu) has its own **Taupulega**, or council of elders. The Taupulega are responsible for making decisions on local matters, while the General Fono, or national parliament, deals with national issues. The General Fono is composed of 20 members, with 7 members from each of the three atolls, and 1 member representing the Tokelauan community in New Zealand. The Ulu-o-Tokelau, or head of government, is elected by the General Fono for a term of one year.

The **separation of powers** in Tokelau is not strictly defined, as the General Fono has both legislative and executive powers. However, the Ulu-o-Tokelau and the Taupulega play important roles in ensuring that power is distributed evenly and that the interests of all Tokelauans are represented. Tokelau's system of government is **unitary**, with the General Fono having the power to make laws for the entire territory.

Tokelau's political system is also influenced by its relationship with New Zealand, which provides significant financial and administrative support to the territory. The Governor-General of New Zealand represents the **head of state** in Tokelau, and New Zealand is responsible for Tokelau's defense and foreign affairs.
