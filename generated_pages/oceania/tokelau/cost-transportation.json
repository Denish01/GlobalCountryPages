  "content": "The cost of transportation in Tokelau is relatively high due to its remote location and limited options, with a monthly transit pass costing around $100 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($100 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($5 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($2.50 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (No)\nCurrency: NZD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nTokelau is a small territory with limited transportation options, and most people rely on walking, cycling, or using small boats to get around. The territory has no public transportation system, and the few vehicles available are mostly used for private transportation. The quality of roads is generally poor, and there are no paved roads on the atolls. As a result, transportation in Tokelau can be challenging, especially during rainy or stormy weather.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Tokelau are boats and small vessels, which are used to travel between the atolls and to access the outer islands. The government provides some transportation services, including a ferry service that connects the atolls, but these services are limited and often unreliable. Most people in Tokelau own their own boats or use shared transportation services to get around. The lack of public transportation and limited road network make it difficult for visitors to get around without prior arrangements.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ferry | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Limited schedule, connects atolls |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, unreliable |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| City Bus | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$20 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | $20-$50 | N/A | $20-$50 | To village center, limited availability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $2.50 | Limited availability |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $2.50 | Limited availability |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $50-$100 | Limited availability, mostly private rentals |\n| Parking (per hour, village) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Ferry | $20-$50 | Limited schedule, connects atolls |\n| Domestic Flight | $200-$500 | From Apia, Samoa, limited schedule |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be prepared for limited transportation options and flexible schedules.\n- Consider renting a private boat or using shared transportation services to get around.\n- Always negotiate taxi fares before you start your journey.\n- Be aware of the limited fuel availability and plan your trips accordingly.\n- Use **cash** as the primary means of payment, as credit card facilities are limited.\n- Respect local customs and traditions when using public or shared transportation services.",
