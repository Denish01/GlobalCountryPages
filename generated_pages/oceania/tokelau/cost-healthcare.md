[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Tokelau's healthcare system is primarily public, with a focus on providing basic medical services to the local population. The system is managed by the Tokelau National Health Service, which operates a hospital and several health clinics throughout the territory. While the public healthcare system is generally of good quality, it can be limited in terms of specialized care and equipment. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical evacuation to New Zealand or other countries with more advanced medical facilities. Locals, on the other hand, can access public healthcare services for free or at a low cost, but may need to travel to New Zealand for more complex treatments.
