  "content": "The population of Tokelau is approximately 2,608 people, with a unique cultural identity shaped by its small size, remote location, and historical ties to New Zealand.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 0.002 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.1%\nMedian Age: 25 years\nUrban Population: 0%\nPopulation Density: 217 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 69 years\nFertility Rate: 2.5 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nTokelau's population is small and relatively stable, with a slow growth rate due to limited economic opportunities and a high rate of out-migration to New Zealand. The population size is roughly equivalent to a small town, and the density is relatively high due to the limited land area. The median age is around 25 years, indicating a relatively young population. Urbanization is not a significant factor in Tokelau, as the territory is composed of three small atolls with no major cities. Migration patterns are primarily driven by economic factors, with many Tokelauans moving to New Zealand for work or education.\n\nThe population of Tokelau is also affected by its remote location and limited access to resources, which can make it difficult to maintain a high standard of living. Despite these challenges, the Tokelauan government and New Zealand authorities have implemented various initiatives to support the local economy and improve living conditions. These efforts have helped to stabilize the population and promote sustainable development in the territory. Overall, Tokelau's population is characterized by its small size, youthfulness, and strong cultural identity.\n\nTokelau's population trends are also influenced by its historical and cultural ties to New Zealand. Many Tokelauans have family connections in New Zealand, and the territory has a long history of migration to the country. This has contributed to a significant Tokelauan diaspora community in New Zealand, which maintains strong links to the territory and provides support to family members and friends back home.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokelauan | 95% | Atafu, Nukunonu, Fakaofo | Indigenous Polynesian people |\n| Samoan | 2% | Atafu, Nukunonu | Migrant community from Samoa |\n| Tuvaluan | 1% | Nukunonu, Fakaofo | Migrant community from Tuvalu |\n| European | 1% | Atafu, Nukunonu | Mostly expatriates and development workers |\n| Other | 1% | Atafu, Nukunonu, Fakaofo | Small numbers of other Pacific Islanders and Asians |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic composition of Tokelau is predominantly Tokelauan, with a small number of Samoans, Tuvaluans, Europeans, and other ethnic groups. The Tokelauan people are indigenous to the territory and have a distinct Polynesian culture and language. The small size of the territory and the limited number of ethnic groups contribute to a strong sense of community and shared identity among Tokelauans. Inter-ethnic relations are generally harmonious, with a focus on mutual respect and cooperation.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Tokelauan** is the primary language spoken in Tokelau, with approximately 95% of the population speaking it as their first language.\n- English is the official language and is widely used in government, education, and business.\n- Samoan is spoken by a small number of people, mostly in the Atafu atoll.\n- Tuvaluan is spoken by a few individuals, mostly in the Nukunonu and Fakaofo atolls.\n- Other languages, such as those spoken by expatriates and development workers, are also present in small numbers.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Congregationalist | 50% | Introduced by European missionaries in the 19th century |\n| Catholic | 30% | Significant minority, with a number of Catholic churches |\n| Other Christian | 15% | Includes Methodist, Baptist, and other denominations |\n| Traditional | 5% | Indigenous spiritual practices and customs |\n[/TABLE]\nThe majority of the population in Tokelau is Christian, with Congregationalist and Catholic being the two main denominations. The introduction of Christianity by European missionaries in the 19th century had a significant impact on the territory's culture and society. Traditional spiritual practices and customs are still observed by a small number of people, particularly in the context of cultural ceremonies and events. Interfaith relations are generally harmonious, with a focus on mutual respect and cooperation.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 30% | High youth population, with significant demands on education and healthcare |\n| 15-24 | 25% | Large number of young adults, with many seeking education and employment opportunities |\n| 25-54 | 35% | Working-age population, with a significant number of people engaged in fishing, agriculture, and public services |\n| 55-64 | 5% | Smaller number of people in this age group, with some continuing to work and others retired |\n| 65+ | 5% | Small number of elderly people, with a high level of respect and care within the community |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- Tokelau has no major cities, with the largest settlement being the village of Atafu, which serves as the capital.\n- The urban-rural split is not significant, as the territory is composed of small atolls with limited population centers.\n- Migration trends are primarily driven by economic factors, with many Tokelauans moving to New Zealand for work or education.\n- The fastest-growing \"cities\" are actually the small villages on each atoll, which are experiencing gradual growth due to improvements in living standards and infrastructure.\n- The Tokelauan diaspora community in New Zealand is significant, with many people maintaining strong links to the territory and providing support to family members and friends back home.",
