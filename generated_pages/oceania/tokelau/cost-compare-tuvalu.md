[SECTION] Overview: Tokelau vs Tuvalu [/SECTION]
Tokelau and Tuvalu are two small island nations in the Pacific Ocean, with Tokelau being a territory of New Zealand and Tuvalu being an independent country. In terms of cost of living, Tuvalu is generally cheaper than Tokelau, with lower prices for rent, food, and transportation. This is largely due to Tuvalu's smaller economy and lower cost of living index. However, it's worth noting that both countries have a relatively high cost of living compared to other countries in the region, due to their remote locations and limited access to goods and services.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Tokelau's economy is heavily reliant on aid from New Zealand, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services. On the other hand, Tuvalu's economy is more diversified, with a growing tourism industry and a strong focus on fishing and agriculture. This diversity can help to keep prices lower and provide more opportunities for locals and expats alike. Overall, Tuvalu is the cheaper option for those looking to live in the Pacific Islands, but both countries offer a unique and rewarding experience for those who are willing to adapt to the local way of life.
