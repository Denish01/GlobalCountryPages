[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The housing market in Tokelau is relatively small and traditional, with many residents living in family-owned homes. The rental market is also limited, with most rentals being available in the capital village of Atafu. Typical lease terms are short, ranging from 6-12 months, and require a deposit of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Tokelau **Housing Act**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as Samoa, Tokelau's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and visitors.

The housing market in Tokelau is also influenced by the country's remote location and limited access to building materials. As a result, the construction of new homes and buildings is often delayed, and the cost of materials is higher than in other countries. However, the **Tokelau Government** has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the provision of low-interest loans for home ownership and the development of new housing projects.
