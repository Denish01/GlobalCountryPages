[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
The business environment in Tokelau is relatively undeveloped, with a small and isolated market. The government of Tokelau, with the support of New Zealand, is working to improve the business climate and attract foreign investment. However, the territory's remote location and limited infrastructure pose significant challenges. The government's attitude towards foreign investment is generally positive, but the bureaucracy can be slow and inefficient. Corruption is not a significant issue in Tokelau, but the lack of transparency and accountability in government decision-making can be a concern.

The government of Tokelau has implemented some measures to improve the business environment, such as simplifying the process of registering a business and providing support for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, more needs to be done to address the territory's significant infrastructure challenges, including the lack of a reliable electricity supply, limited telecommunications, and inadequate transportation links. The government is also working to develop the territory's tourism sector, which has the potential to generate significant revenue and create jobs.

Despite the challenges, Tokelau has a unique cultural heritage and a pristine natural environment, which could be attractive to investors looking to develop sustainable tourism projects or renewable energy initiatives. The territory's exclusive economic zone also offers opportunities for fishing and marine resource development.
