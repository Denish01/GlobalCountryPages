Tokelau, a New Zealand territory, has a relatively high GDP per capita and a stable economy, driven by its fishing industry and aid from New Zealand. In contrast, Wallis and Futuna, a French overseas collectivity, has a lower GDP per capita and a more limited economy, with a strong focus on agriculture and fishing. The cost of living in Tokelau is generally higher due to its remote location, limited access to goods and services, and reliance on imports. Wallis and Futuna, on the other hand, benefits from its association with France, which provides financial support and access to European markets.\n\nThe economic context of both territories plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. Tokelau's economy is heavily dependent on its fishing industry, which generates significant revenue but also drives up costs due to the need for imported goods and services. Wallis and Futuna, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, fishing, and tourism. This diversification helps to keep costs lower and provides a more stable economic environment. Overall, Wallis and Futuna is generally cheaper than Tokelau, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall costs.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Tokelau (USD) | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 600 | 400 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33.3% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Tokelau (USD) | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 350 | 30% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 40% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 33.3% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Tokelau (USD) | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.5 | 1.2 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Tokelau (USD) | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Tokelau (USD) | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33.3% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,800 | 30% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Tokelau is cheaper for:**\n- High-end groceries and imported goods, due to its association with New Zealand\n- Fishing and seafood products, given its strong fishing industry\n- Education, with access to New Zealand's education system\n- Healthcare, with access to New Zealand's healthcare system\n- **Wallis and Futuna is cheaper for:**\n- Local produce and traditional goods, due to its strong agricultural sector\n- Accommodation, with a wider range of affordable housing options\n- Transportation, with lower fuel prices and more affordable public transport\n- Utilities, with lower costs for electricity, water, and internet\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Wallis and Futuna offers better value for money, with a lower cost of living and a more affordable lifestyle.
