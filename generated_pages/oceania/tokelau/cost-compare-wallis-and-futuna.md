[SECTION] Overview: Tokelau vs Wallis and Futuna [/SECTION]
Tokelau and Wallis and Futuna are two Pacific island territories with distinct economic profiles. Tokelau, a New Zealand territory, has a relatively high GDP per capita and a stable economy, driven by its fishing industry and aid from New Zealand. In contrast, Wallis and Futuna, a French overseas collectivity, has a lower GDP per capita and a more limited economy, with a strong focus on agriculture and fishing. The cost of living in Tokelau is generally higher due to its remote location, limited access to goods and services, and reliance on imports. Wallis and Futuna, on the other hand, benefits from its association with France, which provides financial support and access to European markets.

The economic context of both territories plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. Tokelau's economy is heavily dependent on its fishing industry, which generates significant revenue but also drives up costs due to the need for imported goods and services. Wallis and Futuna, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on agriculture, fishing, and tourism. This diversification helps to keep costs lower and provides a more stable economic environment. Overall, Wallis and Futuna is generally cheaper than Tokelau, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall costs.
