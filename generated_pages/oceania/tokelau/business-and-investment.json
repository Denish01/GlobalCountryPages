  "content": "Doing business in Tokelau is challenging due to its remote location, limited infrastructure, and small population, but there are opportunities for investment in specific sectors such as fishing, tourism, and renewable energy.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEase of Doing Business: 67 (out of 190, according to the World Bank ranking)\nCorporate Tax Rate: 30%\nFDI Inflow: $1 million (annual)\nSpecial Economic Zones: No\nKey Industries: Fishing, Tourism, Renewable Energy\nCurrency Stability: Stable\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]\nThe business environment in Tokelau is relatively undeveloped, with a small and isolated market. The government of Tokelau, with the support of New Zealand, is working to improve the business climate and attract foreign investment. However, the territory's remote location and limited infrastructure pose significant challenges.

The government is also working to develop the territory's tourism sector, which has the potential to generate significant revenue and create jobs.\n\nDespite the challenges, Tokelau has a unique cultural heritage and a pristine natural environment, which could be attractive to investors looking to develop sustainable tourism projects or renewable energy initiatives. The territory's exclusive economic zone also offers opportunities for fishing and marine resource development.\n\n[SECTION] Starting a Business [/SECTION]\n| Step | Requirement | Time | Cost (USD)
