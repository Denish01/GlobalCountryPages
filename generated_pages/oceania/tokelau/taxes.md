[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Tokelau's tax system is based on a **territorial taxation** principle, where only income earned within the territory is subject to tax, rather than worldwide income. This means that individuals and businesses are only taxed on income earned from sources within Tokelau. To be considered a tax resident in Tokelau, an individual must be physically present in the territory for at least 183 days in a calendar year. This residency rule applies to both individuals and businesses, and is used to determine which entities are subject to Tokelau's tax laws.

The tax system in Tokelau is also influenced by its relationship with New Zealand, as the territory is subject to New Zealand's tax laws and regulations in many areas. This means that Tokelau's tax system is relatively straightforward, with a focus on simplicity and ease of compliance. However, it's still important for individuals and businesses to understand the key components of the tax system, including income tax, corporate tax, and value-added tax (VAT).
