# Tokelau Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

Tokelau's culture is a unique blend of Polynesian traditions and modern influences, shaped by its history, geography, and strong community ties.

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Tokelau's cultural identity is deeply rooted in its Polynesian heritage, with a strong emphasis on community, family, and respect for elders. The majority of the population is of Tokelauan ethnicity, with a small number of people of Samoan and other Pacific Island descent. The Tokelauan language is the primary language spoken, with English also widely spoken due to the territory's association with New Zealand. The country's cultural identity is also influenced by its Christian heritage, with the majority of the population belonging to the Congregational Christian Church of Tuvalu.

The Tokelauan people have a strong sense of community and cooperation, with a traditional system of communal living and shared resources. This is reflected in the concept of ** Fakavae**, or communal working together, which is an important part of Tokelauan culture. The community comes together to work on projects such as fishing, farming, and construction, and to celebrate special occasions. Tokelau's cultural identity is also shaped by its history, including its experience as a British colony and its current status as a territory of New Zealand.

Tokelau's cultural identity is also reflected in its traditional arts and crafts, such as weaving, carving, and tattooing. The country is known for its beautiful **tapa cloth**, which is made from the bark of the paper mulberry tree and is used for ceremonial and decorative purposes. Tokelauan culture is also rich in storytelling and music, with a strong tradition of oral history and traditional songs and dances.
