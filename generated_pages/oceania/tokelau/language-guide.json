  "content": "The official language of Tokelau is **Tokelauan**, a Polynesian language, and **English**, which is widely used as a second language.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Tokelauan, English\nWidely Spoken: \nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Austronesian\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nTokelauan is the predominant language spoken in Tokelau, with almost the entire population speaking it as their first language. English, on the other hand, is widely used as a second language, particularly in education, government, and tourism. The linguistic landscape of Tokelau is relatively homogeneous, with no significant regional dialects or minority languages. However, there may be some variations in vocabulary and pronunciation between the three atolls that make up Tokelau: Atafu, Nukunonu, and Fakaofo. English is understood by a significant portion of the population, particularly among the younger generation and those in the service industry, but it is still not as widely spoken as Tokelauan.\n\nThe use of English in Tokelau is largely influenced by the country's historical ties with New Zealand, which has been responsible for Tokelau's administration since 1926. As a result, many Tokelauans have been educated in New Zealand or have family ties with New Zealand, which has contributed to the widespread use of English in the territory. Despite this, Tokelauan remains the primary language of communication in most aspects of life, including government, education, and community activities.\n\nThe moderate level of English proficiency in Tokelau means that visitors who speak English may be able to communicate with some locals, particularly in tourist areas and government offices. However, it is still highly recommended to learn some basic Tokelauan phrases to enhance the travel experience and show respect for the local culture. By making an effort to speak the local language, visitors can build stronger relationships with the community and gain a deeper understanding of the unique cultural heritage of Tokelau.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Talofa | tah-LOH-fah | formal |\n| Hello | Kia ora | kee-ah OH-rah | informal |\n| Thank you | Fa'afetai | fah-ah-FEH-tie |  |\n| Please | Fakafetai | fah-kah-FEH-tie |  |\n| Yes / No | Io / Kahore | ee-oh / kah-HOH-reh |  |\n| Excuse me | Tulou | TOO-loo |  |\n| How much? | Tau te oe? | TAH-oo TEH OH-eh |  |\n| Where is...? | Ko fea...? | koh FEH-ah |  |\n| I don't understand | Kahore au e iloa | kah-HOH-reh OW ay ee-LOH-ah |  |\n| Do you speak English? | E tautala koe ki te ingarangi? | eh TAH-oo-tah-lah KOH-eh kee TEH eeng-ah-RAH-nee |  |\n| Help! | Fesoasoani! | feh-soh-ah-SOH-nee |  |\n| Goodbye | Tofa | TOH-fah | formal |\n| Sorry | Fa'afetai | fah-ah-FEH-tie |  |\n| How are you? | Ko fea koe? | koh FEH-ah KOH-eh |  |\n| I'm fine, thank you | Au e lelei, fa'afetai | OW ay LEH-lay, fah-ah-FEH-tie |  |\n| My name is... | Ko toku igoa... | koh TOH-koo ee-GOH-ah |  |\n| I'm from... | Au mai... | OW MY |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Tasi | TAH-see |\n| 2 | Lua | LOO-ah |\n| 3 | Tolu | TOH-loo |\n| 4 | Fa | FAH |\n| 5 | Lima | LEE-mah |\n| 6 | Ono | OH-noh |\n| 7 | Fitu | FEE-too |\n| 8 | Valu | VAH-loo |\n| 9 | Iva | EE-vah |\n| 10 | Sagaulu | SAH-ngah-LOO |\n| 100 | Tasi rau | TAH-see RAH-oo |\n| 1000 | Tasi afe | TAH-see AH-feh |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it is customary to use formal language and titles, such as \"Talofa\" (hello) and \"Tofa\" (goodbye).\n- Respect for elders is deeply ingrained in Tokelauan culture, so it is essential to show deference to older individuals.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered impolite, such as pointing with the feet or touching someone's head.\n- In Tokelau, it is customary to remove your shoes before entering a home or a traditional meeting house.\n- When communicating with locals, be patient and try to speak slowly and clearly.\n- If you need help, do not hesitate to ask, and try to learn some basic Tokelauan phrases to show your appreciation for the culture.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The **Tokelau Language Dictionary** is a valuable resource for learning Tokelauan words and phrases.\n- The **Google Translate** app can be helpful for basic translations, but it may not always provide accurate results.\n- **Language learning apps**, such as Duolingo, can be a useful tool for learning Tokelauan and other languages.\n- **Phrasebooks** and **language guides** can be found at local bookstores or online, and can provide valuable insights into the language and culture of Tokelau.\n- For more advanced language learners, **language exchange programs** can be a great way to practice speaking with native speakers and learn more about the culture.",
