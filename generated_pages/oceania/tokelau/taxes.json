This means that individuals and businesses are only taxed on income earned from sources within Tokelau.

This residency rule applies to both individuals and businesses, and is used to determine which entities are subject to Tokelau's tax laws.\n\nThe tax system in Tokelau is also influenced by its relationship with New Zealand, as the territory is subject to New Zealand's tax laws and regulations in many areas.
