[/SECTION]\nTokelau is a remote territory in the Pacific Ocean, with a high cost of living due to its isolation and limited access to resources. Compared to its neighbors, such as Samoa, Tokelau is more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food. The lack of competition and limited supply of goods and services contribute to the high prices. However, the stunning natural beauty and unique culture of Tokelau make it an attractive destination for travelers willing to pay a premium for the experience.\n\nThe cost of living in Tokelau is also influenced by its relationship with New Zealand, which provides financial support and imports goods to the territory. As a result, prices in Tokelau are often comparable to those in New Zealand, which can be higher than in other Pacific Island nations. Despite the high costs, visitors to Tokelau can still find ways to experience the local culture and natural beauty without breaking the bank, such as by staying in budget-friendly accommodations and eating at local eateries.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-60 | basic rooms with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $100-200 | comfortable rooms with private bathrooms |\n| Luxury/Resort | $250-500 | high-end amenities and stunning ocean views |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $400-800 | limited availability, mostly in Atafu |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-60 |\n| Fine Dining | $60-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-2 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $5-10 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 400 | 600 | 1,000 |\n| Food | 300 | 500 | 800 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 150 | 250 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 300 | 500 |\n| **Total** | **1,100** | **1,850** | **3,150** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in budget-friendly accommodations, such as hostels or guesthouses, to save on accommodation costs.\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls, which offer affordable and delicious meals.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce transport costs.\n- Buy groceries and cook your own meals instead of eating out for every meal.\n- Take advantage of free activities, such as exploring the island's natural beauty or attending local events.\n- Negotiate prices when shopping at local markets or from street vendors to get the best deals.",
