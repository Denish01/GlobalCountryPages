[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Tokelau's utility infrastructure is limited, and the quality can vary depending on the atoll and the availability of resources. The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to the territory's reliance on imported fuel and the impact of seasonal weather patterns. During the dry season, from May to October, water conservation is crucial, and residents may experience restrictions on water usage. In contrast, the wet season, from November to April, can bring an increased risk of power outages and disruptions to utility services.

The Tokelauan government and the New Zealand government, as the parent country, work together to maintain and improve the utility infrastructure, including the installation of solar panels and wind turbines to reduce the territory's reliance on fossil fuels. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for residents, and the lack of competition in the market can limit options for consumers. The cost of utilities is generally stable, but prices can increase due to external factors such as changes in global fuel prices.
