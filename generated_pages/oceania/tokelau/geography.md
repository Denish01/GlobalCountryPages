[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Tokelau is situated in the southern Pacific Ocean, approximately 480 kilometers north of Samoa. The territory consists of three atolls, Atafu, Nukunonu, and Fakaofo, which are scattered over a distance of about 150 kilometers. The atolls are surrounded by coral reefs, and the territory has no land borders with any other country. The Pacific Ocean surrounds Tokelau, with the closest neighboring country being Samoa to the south.

The location of Tokelau in the Pacific Ocean makes it a remote and isolated territory, with limited access to the outside world. The territory is accessible only by boat, and there are no airfields or harbors capable of handling large ships. The isolation of Tokelau has helped to preserve the unique culture and way of life of its inhabitants, who have developed a distinct identity shaped by their history, language, and traditions. The territory's location also makes it vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and increased storm activity.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Tokelau is characterized by low-lying coral atolls, with no mountains or hills. The highest point in the territory is only about 5 meters above sea level, making it one of the flattest countries in the world. The atolls are surrounded by coral reefs, which provide a habitat for a diverse range of marine life. The coastline of Tokelau is approximately 101 kilometers long, and is characterized by coral beaches, lagoons, and rocky shores.

The landscape of Tokelau is dominated by the ocean, with the atolls rising only slightly above the surrounding waters. The territory has no rivers or lakes, and the only freshwater sources are rainwater collection systems and wells. The soil is thin and poor in nutrients, making it difficult to grow crops, and the territory is heavily reliant on imports to meet its food needs. Despite these challenges, the people of Tokelau have developed a unique and sustainable way of life, based on fishing, coconut cultivation, and other traditional activities.

The atolls of Tokelau are also home to a range of flora and fauna, including coconut trees, pandanus, and other tropical plants. The territory's coral reefs are home to a diverse range of marine life, including fish, sea turtles, and coral species. The reefs also provide important habitat for seabirds, including boobies, frigatebirds, and terns. The unique biodiversity of Tokelau is an important part of the territory's natural heritage, and efforts are being made to protect and conserve the territory's ecosystems.
