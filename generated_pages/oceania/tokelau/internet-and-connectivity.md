[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Tokelau is generally of poor quality, with slow speeds and limited availability. This is due to the country's remote location and lack of infrastructure, making it difficult for internet service providers to establish reliable connections. In urban areas, such as the capital Atafu, internet access is slightly better, but it is still limited and often unreliable. In rural areas, internet access is almost non-existent, making it challenging for residents and tourists to stay connected.

The reliability of the internet in Tokelau is also a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions to service. This can be frustrating for tourists and remote workers who rely on a stable internet connection to stay in touch with family and friends or to complete work tasks. However, the **Tokelauan government** is working to improve internet access and quality, with plans to upgrade the country's internet infrastructure and increase connectivity.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Tokelau, tourists can visit the **Telecom Tokelau** office in Atafu, which is the main carrier in the country. To purchase a SIM card, tourists will need to provide a valid passport and pay approximately 20 USD for a tourist SIM. The SIM card comes with a limited data plan, and additional data can be purchased as needed. **Bluesky** is another carrier that offers SIM cards and data plans, but their coverage is limited to certain areas of the country.
