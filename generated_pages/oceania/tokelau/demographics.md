[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Tokelau's population is small and relatively stable, with a slow growth rate due to limited economic opportunities and a high rate of out-migration to New Zealand. The population size is roughly equivalent to a small town, and the density is relatively high due to the limited land area. The median age is around 25 years, indicating a relatively young population. Urbanization is not a significant factor in Tokelau, as the territory is composed of three small atolls with no major cities. Migration patterns are primarily driven by economic factors, with many Tokelauans moving to New Zealand for work or education.

The population of Tokelau is also affected by its remote location and limited access to resources, which can make it difficult to maintain a high standard of living. Despite these challenges, the Tokelauan government and New Zealand authorities have implemented various initiatives to support the local economy and improve living conditions. These efforts have helped to stabilize the population and promote sustainable development in the territory. Overall, Tokelau's population is characterized by its small size, youthfulness, and strong cultural identity.

Tokelau's population trends are also influenced by its historical and cultural ties to New Zealand. Many Tokelauans have family connections in New Zealand, and the territory has a long history of migration to the country. This has contributed to a significant Tokelauan diaspora community in New Zealand, which maintains strong links to the territory and provides support to family members and friends back home.
