The rental market is also limited, with most rentals being available in the capital village of Atafu. Typical lease terms are short, ranging from 6-12 months, and require a deposit of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Tokelau **Housing Act**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as Samoa, Tokelau's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and visitors.\n\nThe housing market in Tokelau is also influenced by the country's remote location and limited access to building materials. As a result, the construction of new homes and buildings is often delayed, and the cost of materials is higher than in other countries. However, the **Tokelau Government** has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the provision of low-interest loans for home ownership and the development of new housing projects.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$250 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $150-$350 | fully furnished, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$600 | $250-$500 | family size, fully furnished, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 3 Bedroom | $400-$800 | $350-$700 | spacious, fully furnished, private kitchen and bathroom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, ocean views |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, close to amenities |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | coastal areas, limited access to amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Atafu Village: $200-$400 USD per month, traditional village with local amenities and shops\n- Nukunonu Village: $250-$500 USD per month, coastal village with beautiful ocean views and outdoor activities\n- Fakaofo Village: $300-$600 USD per month, largest village in Tokelau, with shops, restaurants, and community facilities\n- Motuhaga: $150-$350 USD per month, rural area with limited amenities, but peaceful and scenic surroundings\n- Haumagahau: $200-$400 USD per month, coastal area with stunning ocean views and outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Tokelau [/SECTION]\n- Research local real estate agents and property managers to find available rentals\n- Be prepared to negotiate rent and lease terms, as the market is relatively small and flexible\n- [CALLOUT] Be aware of scams and ensure that you are dealing with a reputable landlord or agent\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually included in the rent, but internet and phone services may be extra\n- Furnished apartments are more common than unfurnished, but it's still possible to find unfurnished options\n- Learn some basic **Tokelauan** phrases to help with communication and negotiation with local landlords and property managers",
