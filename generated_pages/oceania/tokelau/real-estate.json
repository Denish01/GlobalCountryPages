  "content": "The property market in Tokelau is extremely limited and largely restricted to locals, with few opportunities for foreigners to buy or invest in real estate. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nCan Foreigners Buy?: Restricted\nAverage Price (Capital, per sqm): 1,500 USD\nRental Yield: 5%\nProperty Tax: 0.5%\nPopular Areas: Atafu, Nukunonu, Fakaofo\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]\nThe real estate market in Tokelau is characterized by a severe shortage of available properties, largely due to the territory's small size and limited land area. The market is primarily driven by local demand, with most properties being passed down through generations or sold to other locals. The lack of infrastructure, limited access to financing, and restrictive foreign ownership rules further hinder the development of a robust property market. As a result, prices for available properties tend to be relatively high, especially in the capital Atafu. The price trajectory has been stable in recent years, with some fluctuations due to changes in the local economy. Urban areas, such as the villages in Atafu and Nukunonu, tend to have higher prices than rural areas, which are largely limited to small, traditional settlements.\n\nThe market is also influenced by the territory's **subsistence economy**, where many residents rely on fishing, farming, and other traditional activities for their livelihood. This has led to a strong emphasis on community and family ties, with properties often being passed down through generations or sold to other locals. The limited availability of modern amenities and services, such as electricity, water, and healthcare, also affects the property market, with many residents prioritizing access to these essential services when choosing a property.\n\nOverall, the property market in Tokelau is highly localized and subject to unique cultural and economic factors. Foreigners looking to invest in the territory must navigate complex ownership rules and regulations, as well as the challenges of operating in a remote and isolated environment.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Atafu | 1,800 | 200 | Residential |\n| Nukunonu | 1,500 | 150 | Residential |\n| Fakaofo | 1,200 | 100 | Residential |\n| Atafu Village | 2,000 | 250 | Commercial |\n| Nukunonu Village | 1,800 | 200 | Commercial |\n| Fakaofo Village | 1,500 | 150 | Commercial |\n| Rural Atafu | 1,000 | 80 | Residential |\n| Rural Nukunonu | 900 | 70 | Residential |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are restricted from buying freehold properties in Tokelau, with most properties being owned by locals or the **Tokelauan government**.\n- Foreigners can lease properties for up to 60 years, with the option to renew, but must obtain approval from the Tokelauan government.\n- Foreign companies can own properties in Tokelau, but must be registered with the Tokelauan government and meet specific requirements.\n- Foreigners must obtain a **permit to reside** in Tokelau before they can purchase or lease a property.\n- Foreigners are subject to **stamp duty** and other taxes on property transactions, which can range from 2-5% of the property's value.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
