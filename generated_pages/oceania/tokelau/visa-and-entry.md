[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Tokelau has a relatively strict visa policy, with only a few countries having visa-free access. The territory is a non-self-governing territory of New Zealand, and as such, its visa policy is closely tied to that of New Zealand. Citizens of countries that have a visa-free arrangement with New Zealand may also be eligible for a permit to enter Tokelau. However, due to the remote location and limited infrastructure of the territory, visitor numbers are heavily restricted, and all travelers must obtain permission to enter from the Tokelau Government.

The visa policy of Tokelau is designed to protect the territory's unique culture and environment, as well as to ensure the safety and well-being of its residents. As a result, the number of visitors allowed to enter the territory is limited, and all travelers must meet specific requirements and follow certain procedures. The Tokelau Government is responsible for issuing permits to enter the territory, and all applications are carefully reviewed to ensure that they meet the necessary criteria.
