[SECTION] Overview: Tokelau vs Samoa [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Tokelau and Samoa varies significantly, despite both being located in the Pacific Islands. Tokelau, as a territory of New Zealand, has a higher cost of living due to its remote location and reliance on imports. The country's economy is primarily driven by fishing and copra production, which contributes to its higher prices. In contrast, Samoa has a more diverse economy, with a growing tourism sector and a stronger focus on agriculture, which helps to keep costs lower. Overall, Samoa is around 20-30% cheaper than Tokelau, making it a more attractive option for those looking for an affordable Pacific Island lifestyle.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Tokelau's economy is heavily reliant on aid from New Zealand, which can lead to price fluctuations and a higher cost of living. In contrast, Samoa has a more stable economy, with a growing GDP and a diverse range of industries. This stability helps to keep prices lower and makes Samoa a more attractive option for those looking for a affordable and stable lifestyle. Additionally, Samoa's larger population and more developed infrastructure also contribute to its lower costs, with a wider range of goods and services available at competitive prices.
