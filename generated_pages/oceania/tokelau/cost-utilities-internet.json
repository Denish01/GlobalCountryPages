  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Tokelau can be relatively high due to its remote location and limited infrastructure, with a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment averaging around $250-$300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($275 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($100 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.35 per kWh)\nCurrency: NZD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nTokelau's utility infrastructure is limited, and the quality can vary depending on the atoll and the availability of resources. The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to the territory's reliance on imported fuel and the impact of seasonal weather patterns. During the dry season, from May to October, water conservation is crucial, and residents may experience restrictions on water usage. In contrast, the wet season, from November to April, can bring an increased risk of power outages and disruptions to utility services.\n\nThe Tokelauan government and the New Zealand government, as the parent country, work together to maintain and improve the utility infrastructure, including the installation of solar panels and wind turbines to reduce the territory's reliance on fossil fuels. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for residents, and the lack of competition in the market can limit options for consumers. The cost of utilities is generally stable, but prices can increase due to external factors such as changes in global fuel prices.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $160 |  |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 |  |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | Not applicable |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | Included in general rates |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$165** | **$220** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-$70 | 10 Mbps | Teletok, Tokelau Telecom |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-$150 | 60 Mbps | Teletok, Tokelau Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-$20 | 1-5 GB | Teletok, Tokelau Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$50 | 5-10 GB | Teletok, Tokelau Telecom |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-$150 | varies | Teletok, Tokelau Telecom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | Available through satellite internet |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | Available through mobile data or internet |\n| Local Streaming | $0 | Limited options available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Tokelau, residents typically need to contact the Teletok or Tokelau Telecom offices and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity options are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience for residents.\n- The best internet providers in Tokelau are Teletok and Tokelau Telecom, which offer a range of plans and services.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and reducing waste.\n- Residents can also consider investing in solar panels or other renewable energy sources to reduce their reliance on the grid and lower their utility bills.",
