  "content": "The infrastructure in Tokelau is limited and faces challenges due to its remote location and small population, with efforts being made to improve access to basic services such as electricity, water, and telecommunications.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 40%\nRoad Network: 6 km, unpaved and narrow\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1 (Atafu)\nMajor Ports: 1 (Atafu)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nTokelau's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with a strong reliance on **aid from New Zealand** to support its basic services. Recent investments have focused on improving the **reliability of electricity supply** and expanding access to **clean water**. However, there remains a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with the majority of the population living in rural villages. The lack of economic resources and limited access to technology have hindered the development of modern infrastructure in Tokelau.\n\nThe **remote location** of Tokelau, consisting of three small atolls, poses significant challenges to the development of its infrastructure. The lack of natural resources, limited land area, and **vulnerability to climate change** all contribute to the difficulties faced by the territory. Despite these challenges, the government of Tokelau, with the support of New Zealand, is working to improve the infrastructure and provide better services to its population.\n\nThe development of infrastructure in Tokelau is also hindered by the **limited capacity of the local workforce**. The majority of the population lacks the necessary skills and training to maintain and operate modern infrastructure, making it necessary to rely on external expertise. This has resulted in a significant proportion of the budget being allocated to **consulting services** and **technical assistance**.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 6 km | Poor | Unpaved and narrow, limited access to vehicles |\n| Railways | none | - | - |\n| Airports | 1 international, 0 domestic | Basic | Limited facilities and services |\n| Ports | 1 major | Basic | Limited capacity and facilities |\n[/TABLE]\nThe transport infrastructure in Tokelau is limited, with only a few kilometers of roads and a single airport. The roads are unpaved and narrow, making it difficult to access certain areas of the atolls. The airport, located on the atoll of Atafu, provides limited services and facilities. The port, also located on Atafu, has a limited capacity and is only able to accommodate small vessels.\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The **primary source of electricity** is diesel generators, which provide power to the majority of the population.\n- The **reliability of the electricity supply** is a significant concern, with frequent outages and power disruptions.\n- **Renewable energy sources**, such as solar and wind power, are being explored as alternatives to diesel generators.\n- The **cost of electricity** is high, making it a significant burden for the population.\n- **Energy efficiency** is being promoted through awareness campaigns and the distribution of energy-efficient appliances.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern, with the majority of the population relying on **rainwater collection** and **well water**.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with many households lacking access to proper **toilets and sewage systems**.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many households relying on **trucked-in water** or **water tanks**.\n- **Water conservation** is being promoted through awareness campaigns and the distribution of **water-efficient appliances**.\n- **Waste management** is a significant concern, with limited facilities and services available for the disposal of **waste and sewage**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is limited, with only a few areas having access to **mobile phone services**.\n- **Fiber/broadband** services are not available, with the majority of the population relying on **satellite internet**.\n- **4G/5G rollout** is not planned, due to the limited demand and **high cost of implementation**.\n- **Postal services** are limited, with only a few areas having access to **mail delivery**.\n- **Telecommunication services** are being improved through the installation of **new satellite equipment** and the expansion of **mobile phone services**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Tokelau Renewable Energy Project** aims to reduce the territory's reliance on diesel generators and promote the use of **renewable energy sources**.\n- The **Tokelau Water and Sanitation Project** aims to improve access to **clean water** and **sanitation services** for the population.\n- The **Tokelau Transport Infrastructure Project** aims to improve the **roads and ports** and provide better access to **transport services**.\n- The **Tokelau Telecommunication Project** aims to improve **mobile coverage** and provide access to **fiber/broadband services**.\n- The **Tokelau Climate Change Adaptation Project** aims to **enhance the resilience** of the territory's infrastructure to the impacts of **climate change**.",
