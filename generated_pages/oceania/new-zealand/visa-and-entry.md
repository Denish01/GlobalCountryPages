[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, electronic visas, and traditional visa requirements. Citizens of over 60 countries can enter New Zealand without a visa, while others may need to apply for a visa before their trip. The country aims to balance the need to facilitate travel and tourism with the need to maintain security and control over its borders.

New Zealand's visa policy is designed to be efficient and streamlined, with many applications able to be submitted online. However, the requirements and processing times can vary depending on the type of visa and the applicant's nationality. In general, visa-free travelers can stay in New Zealand for up to 6 months, while those who require a visa may have different stay limits and requirements.

Extensions are possible, but must be applied for before the initial stay period expires.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may need to provide additional documentation, such as an invitation letter from a New Zealand company or a copy of their business itinerary. They may also need to apply for a different type of visa, depending on the purpose and duration of their stay.
**Students:** Students who wish to study in New Zealand will need to apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment in a New Zealand educational institution, as well as proof of sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay. The duration of the visa will depend on the length of the course of study.
**Workers:** Workers who wish to work in New Zealand will need to apply for a work visa, which requires a job offer from a New Zealand employer and a copy of their employment contract. The employer must also demonstrate that they cannot find a suitable New Zealand citizen or resident to fill the position.
