        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>New Zealand has a rich and complex history that spans over 700 years. The first <strong>Polynesian</strong> settlers arrived in New Zealand around the 13th century, with the <strong>Maori</strong> people developing a distinct culture and language. In 1642, Dutch explorer <strong>Abel Tasman</strong> became the first European to sight New Zealand. British explorer <strong>James Cook</strong> followed in 1769, mapping the coastlines and establishing trade relationships with the Maori. The <strong>Treaty of Waitangi</strong> was signed in 1840, granting the British Crown sovereignty over the islands in exchange for Maori control over their land and cultural practices.</p>
        <p>The 19th century saw a significant influx of European settlers, leading to conflicts over land ownership and cultural differences. The <strong>New Zealand Wars</strong> (1845-1872) were a series of conflicts between the British government and the Maori, resulting in the loss of land and autonomy for the Maori people. In 1907, New Zealand gained <strong>dominion status</strong>, giving it a degree of autonomy from Britain. The country played a significant role in both <strong>World War I</strong> and <strong>World War II</strong>, contributing troops and resources to the Allied efforts.</p>
        <p>New Zealand gained full <strong>independence</strong> from Britain in 1947, with the <strong>Statute of Westminster Adoption Act</strong>. The country has since developed a distinct national identity, with a strong focus on <strong>biculturalism</strong> and <strong>multiculturalism</strong>. The <strong>Maori Language Act</strong> of 1987 recognized Te Reo Maori as an official language, and efforts have been made to revitalize Maori culture and language. Today, New Zealand is a <strong>sovereign nation</strong>, with a diverse population and a strong economy.</p>
        <p>The country's history has been marked by significant events, including the <strong>Waitangi Tribunal</strong> (1975), which was established to investigate Maori claims of breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. The <strong>Resource Management Act</strong> (1991) aimed to balance economic development with environmental and cultural concerns. New Zealand has also been at the forefront of <strong>social and environmental issues</strong>, including women's suffrage, nuclear disarmament, and climate change.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "New Zealand is a small, insignificant country"</p>

        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All New Zealanders are of European descent"</p>

        <p>Reality: Like any country, New Zealand has its share of <strong>crime and safety concerns</strong>, including a rising rate of violent crime in some areas [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "New Zealand's economy is solely based on agriculture"</p>
        <p>Reality: While <strong>agriculture</strong> is a significant sector, New Zealand's economy is also driven by <strong>tourism</strong>, <strong>manufacturing</strong>, and <strong>services</strong>, with a growing <strong>tech industry</strong> [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "New Zealand is a remote, hard-to-reach country"</p>
        <p>Reality: New Zealand has a well-developed <strong>transportation network</strong>, with international airports, seaports, and a comprehensive road system, making it easily accessible to visitors and trade partners [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <h2>Challenges & Context</h2>
        <ul>

        <li>The country's <strong>ageing population</strong> poses significant challenges for its pension and healthcare systems, with a <strong>dependency ratio</strong> of around 25%</li>
        <li>New Zealand's <strong>geographic isolation</strong> can make it difficult to maintain economic competitiveness and attract foreign investment, with a <strong>trade-to-GDP ratio</strong> of around 40%</li>
