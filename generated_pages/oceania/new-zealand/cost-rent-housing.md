[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand's housing market is highly competitive, particularly in major cities like Auckland and Wellington. The rental market is characterized by high demand and limited supply, which has driven up prices in recent years. Typical lease terms are 6-12 months, with a deposit of 2-4 weeks' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under the Residential Tenancies Act, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors like Australia, New Zealand's housing costs are relatively high, with the average house price being around 6-8 times the average annual salary.

The housing market in New Zealand is also influenced by the country's strong economy and high standard of living. The government has implemented various policies to address the housing affordability issue, including increasing the supply of housing and providing assistance to first-home buyers. However, the market remains highly competitive, and renters and buyers need to be prepared to act quickly when they find a suitable property. The country's **inflation rate** of 2.9% and **GDP per capita** of $55,551 also play a significant role in shaping the housing market.
