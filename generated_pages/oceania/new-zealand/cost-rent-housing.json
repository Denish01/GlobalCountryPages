The rental market is characterized by high demand and limited supply, which has driven up prices in recent years. Typical lease terms are 6-12 months, with a deposit of 2-4 weeks' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under the Residential Tenancies Act, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors like Australia, New Zealand's housing costs are relatively high, with the average house price being around 6-8 times the average annual salary.\n\nThe housing market in New Zealand is also influenced by the country's strong economy and high standard of living. The government has implemented various policies to address the housing affordability issue, including increasing the supply of housing and providing assistance to first-home buyers. However, the market remains highly competitive, and renters and buyers need to be prepared to act quickly when they find a suitable property. The country's **inflation rate** of 2.9% and **GDP per capita** of $55,551 also play a significant role in shaping the housing market.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,200 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,500-$2,500 | $1,000-$1,800 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $2,000-$3,500 | $1,200-$2,500 | family-friendly, amenities like gym and pool |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,500 | $1,800-$3,500 | spacious, luxurious finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $6,000-$10,000 | prime locations, modern apartments |\n| Suburbs | $4,000-$8,000 | residential areas, family-friendly homes |\n| Rural | $2,000-$5,000 | lifestyle blocks, farmhouses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Te Aro**: a trendy neighborhood in Wellington, with typical rent range of $1,500-$2,500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its vibrant nightlife and cultural attractions.\n- **Kelburn**: a family-friendly neighborhood in Wellington, with typical rent range of $1,200-$2,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, offering stunning views of the city and harbor.\n- **Ponsonby**: a upscale neighborhood in Auckland, with typical rent range of $1,800-$3,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its boutique shops and restaurants.\n- **Mt.
