The country's indigenous Maori people have had a significant impact on the development of its food culture, with traditional dishes like Hangi and Kumara still widely enjoyed today. British colonization also left its mark, introducing ingredients like meat pies and fish and chips, while Asian immigration has added a diverse range of flavors and cooking techniques. Regional variations are also evident, with the South Island known for its seafood and the North Island famous for its kiwifruit and avocados.\n\nNew Zealand's cuisine is also characterized by its emphasis on fresh, local ingredients and its strong food safety regulations. The country is home to a thriving agricultural sector, with many farms and producers focusing on sustainable and organic practices. This commitment to quality and freshness is reflected in the country's many restaurants, cafes, and markets, where visitors can sample the best of New Zealand's produce. From traditional Maori feasts to modern fusion cuisine, New Zealand's food culture is a unique and exciting reflection of its history, geography, and cultural diversity.\n\nThe country's food culture is also closely tied to its social and cultural traditions. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to connect with family and friends, and food plays a central role in many social gatherings and celebrations. Visitors to New Zealand can experience this hospitality firsthand by attending a traditional Maori hangi or visiting a local market or food festival.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes
