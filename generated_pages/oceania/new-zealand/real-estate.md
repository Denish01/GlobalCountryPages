[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The New Zealand property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including low interest rates, a shortage of housing supply, and a strong economy. The market is currently characterized by high demand and limited supply, particularly in urban areas such as Auckland and Wellington. As a result, prices have been rising steadily, with the national median house price increasing by over 10% in the past year. The market is expected to continue growing, although at a slower pace, as the government implements policies aimed at cooling the market and improving affordability.

In terms of trends, there is a shift towards more **sustainable** and **eco-friendly** properties, with buyers increasingly looking for homes with green features such as solar panels and rainwater harvesting systems. Additionally, there is a growing demand for **apartments** and **townhouses**, particularly in urban areas, as buyers seek more affordable and low-maintenance options. The **rural** property market is also performing well, with many buyers looking for **lifestyle blocks** and **hobby farms**.

The urban-rural divide is also evident in the market, with urban areas tend to have higher prices and faster growth rates compared to rural areas. However, rural areas offer a more **affordable** option for buyers, with lower prices and a more relaxed lifestyle. Overall, the New Zealand property market offers a range of options for buyers, from **luxury homes** to **affordable apartments**, and from **coastal** to **rural** properties.
