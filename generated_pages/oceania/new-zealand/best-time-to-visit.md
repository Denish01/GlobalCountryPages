[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, and the weather varies significantly between the North and South Islands. The **dry season** typically runs from October to April, with warm and sunny weather, while the **wet season** occurs from May to September, with cooler temperatures and increased rainfall. The country's diverse climate zones range from subtropical in the north to temperate in the south, and the seasons have a significant impact on travel plans. For example, the **summer months** (December to February) are ideal for outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and water sports, while the **winter months** (June to August) are better suited for skiing and snowboarding.

The seasons also affect the crowds and prices, with the peak season (December to February) being the busiest and most expensive time to visit. The shoulder season (September to November and March to May) offers a great balance between pleasant weather and smaller crowds, making it an ideal time to explore the country. The **spring season** (September to November) is particularly beautiful, with blooming flowers and lush green landscapes, while the **autumn season** (March to May) offers stunning foliage and comfortable temperatures.

New Zealand's climate and seasons also have a significant impact on the country's festivals and events, with many events timed to coincide with the peak season. However, visiting during the shoulder season can provide a more relaxed and affordable experience, with many attractions and activities still available.
