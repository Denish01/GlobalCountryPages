[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand has a well-developed transportation system, with various modes of transport available to suit different needs and budgets. The main transportation modes in New Zealand include buses, trains, ferries, and domestic flights. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent and reliable services connecting major cities and towns. However, the public transportation system can be limited in rural areas, where personal vehicles or shuttle services may be the only options. Most people in New Zealand get around by driving their own vehicles, but public transportation is also a popular option, especially in cities like Auckland and Wellington.

The country's scenic roads and stunning landscapes make driving a popular option for tourists and locals alike. However, with a relatively high cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance, driving can be expensive. On the other hand, public transportation is generally affordable and convenient, with a single city bus fare costing around $3 USD. The country is also investing in sustainable transportation options, such as electric and hybrid vehicles, to reduce its carbon footprint.
