# New Zealand Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
New Zealand's culture is a unique blend of indigenous Maori and European influences, with a strong emphasis on community, nature, and innovation. The country's history, geography, and cultural heritage have shaped its identity, making it a distinct and fascinating place to visit. The Maori people, the indigenous Polynesian inhabitants of New Zealand, have had a profound impact on the country's culture, language, and customs. The Maori language, also known as Te Reo, is an official language of New Zealand, and many Maori customs and traditions are still practiced today.

The country's cultural identity is also influenced by its European settler history, with many New Zealanders having British, Irish, or Scottish ancestry. This mix of cultures has created a distinct New Zealand identity, which is reflected in its art, literature, music, and cuisine. New Zealand is also a multicultural society, with significant Asian, Pacific Island, and other ethnic communities, adding to the country's cultural diversity. The concept of **whakapapa**, or genealogy, is also important in Maori culture, and many New Zealanders take pride in their ancestry and cultural heritage.

New Zealand's cultural identity is also deeply connected to its stunning natural environment. The country's rugged landscapes, beautiful coastlines, and unique wildlife have inspired a strong sense of environmentalism and conservation. Many New Zealanders are passionate about outdoor activities, such as hiking, surfing, and skiing, and the country is home to many national parks, forests, and protected areas. This connection to nature is reflected in New Zealand's art, literature, and music, with many artists and writers drawing inspiration from the country's beautiful landscapes.
