The population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, with a median age of 38 years. The majority of the population, around 86.7%, resides in urban areas, with the remainder living in rural areas.

New Zealand's population is also characterized by a high life expectancy, with an average of 81.1 years, and a relatively low fertility rate of 1.8 children per woman.\n\nThe country's population growth is also influenced by migration patterns, with a significant number of immigrants arriving from countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and Asia.
