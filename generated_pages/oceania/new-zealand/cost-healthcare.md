[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining public and private healthcare providers, with the public system being generally more affordable and accessible to locals, while private healthcare offers more comprehensive and quicker services, often with shorter waiting times. The public healthcare system is primarily funded through general taxation and is available to all citizens and permanent residents, with some services being free or low-cost, such as doctor visits and hospital stays, while others may require a co-payment or have some out-of-pocket costs.

For foreigners, the situation is different, as they may not be eligible for the public healthcare system, and may need to rely on private healthcare providers, which can be more expensive, or have private health insurance to cover their medical expenses. It is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance to cover their medical expenses while in New Zealand, as medical costs can be high, and the public healthcare system may not be available to them. There are various types of health insurance available, including basic local insurance, comprehensive private insurance, and international or expat insurance, which can provide different levels of coverage and benefits.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In a medical emergency, it is best to call the emergency number 111, which will connect you to the ambulance service or the police, depending on the nature of the emergency. Ambulance services are widely available, but may be delayed in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to have some form of health insurance to cover their medical expenses, as emergency care can be expensive. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in New Zealand include Auckland City Hospital, Wellington Hospital, and Christchurch Hospital, which offer a range of medical services and have experience treating international patients.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is also a good idea to have a plan in place, such as knowing the location of the nearest hospital or having a list of emergency contact numbers. Additionally, it is a good idea to have a basic first aid kit and to know some basic first aid techniques, such as CPR and wound care. By being prepared and having a plan in place, you can help ensure that you receive the medical care you need in the event of an emergency.
