[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand's population is relatively small compared to other countries, but it has been steadily growing over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, with a median age of 38 years. The majority of the population, around 86.7%, resides in urban areas, with the remainder living in rural areas.

New Zealand's population is also characterized by a high life expectancy, with an average of 81.1 years, and a relatively low fertility rate of 1.8 children per woman.

The country's population growth is also influenced by migration patterns, with a significant number of immigrants arriving from countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and Asia. This has contributed to the country's cultural diversity and has helped to shape its demographic profile. New Zealand's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a moderate rate, driven by a combination of natural increase and net migration.

New Zealand's population size and growth trends have significant implications for the country's economy, education system, and social services. The government has implemented various policies to manage population growth, including immigration controls and urban planning strategies. These efforts aim to balance the need for economic growth with the need to maintain a high quality of life and protect the country's natural environment.
