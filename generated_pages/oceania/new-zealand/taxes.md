[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand has a **territorial tax system**, which means that tax is generally only paid on income earned from New Zealand sources, although **worldwide taxation** applies to residents who earn income from foreign sources. To be considered a **tax resident** in New Zealand, an individual must meet certain criteria, such as being present in the country for more than 183 days in a 12-month period, having a permanent home in New Zealand, or being away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. The tax system is overseen by the **Inland Revenue Department (IRD)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, administering tax laws, and providing guidance to taxpayers.

The tax system in New Zealand is designed to be fair and equitable, with a range of **tax credits** and **allowances** available to reduce the tax burden on individuals and families. The IRD also offers a range of **tax incentives** to encourage businesses to invest and grow in New Zealand. For example, the **New Zealand Superannuation Fund** provides a tax credit to individuals who contribute to a qualifying superannuation scheme. Additionally, the **KiwiSaver** scheme provides a tax credit to individuals who contribute to a qualifying KiwiSaver scheme.
