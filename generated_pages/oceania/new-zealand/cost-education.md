[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand's education system is highly regarded, with a strong focus on public education, which is generally considered to be of high quality and free or subsidized for local students. The language of instruction is English, with Maori also being an official language and taught in many schools. Compulsory education in New Zealand spans 13 years, from primary school (ages 5-11) to secondary school (ages 11-18). International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Auckland and Wellington, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and Cambridge International Examinations.

The quality of education in New Zealand is generally high, with public schools being well-funded and staffed by qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, can offer smaller class sizes and more specialized programs, but often come with a higher price tag. International schools can provide a more global perspective and curriculum, but may also be more expensive than public or private schools. Overall, New Zealand's education system is well-regarded and provides students with a strong foundation for future success.
