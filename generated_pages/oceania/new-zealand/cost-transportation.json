The main transportation modes in New Zealand include buses, trains, ferries, and domestic flights. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent and reliable services connecting major cities and towns. However, the public transportation system can be limited in rural areas, where personal vehicles or shuttle services may be the only options. Most people in New Zealand get around by driving their own vehicles, but public transportation is also a popular option, especially in cities like Auckland and Wellington.\n\nThe country's scenic roads and stunning landscapes make driving a popular option for tourists and locals alike. However, with a relatively high cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance, driving can be expensive. On the other hand, public transportation is generally affordable and convenient, with a single city bus fare costing around $3 USD. The country is also investing in sustainable transportation options, such as electric and hybrid vehicles, to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $3 | $120 | Comprehensive coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | No metro or subway system in New Zealand |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | $10-$20 | $200 | Available in Auckland and Wellington |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3 | $2.50 | $10-$20 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2 | $1.50 | $10-$20 | Uber, Zoomy available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $30-$50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.80 | 91 and 95 octane available |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.70 | Mainly for commercial vehicles |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-$100 | Economy car, depending on location and season |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in city centers |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, mainly in Auckland |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Multiple operators, frequent services |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$200 | Depending on route and season |\n| Train (long-distance) | $100-$200 | Limited routes, scenic journeys |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider purchasing a **Hop** card for convenient and affordable travel on public transportation in Auckland and Wellington.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like **Uber** and **Zoomy** for door-to-door services, especially at night or in areas with limited public transportation.\n- Book intercity bus and train tickets in advance to secure the best prices.\n- Be aware of **road tolls** and **parking fees** when driving, as they can add up quickly.\n- Use **petrol price comparison apps** to find the cheapest fuel options along your route.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local **road safety** guidelines to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.",
