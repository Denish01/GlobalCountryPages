The language of instruction is English, with Maori also being an official language and taught in many schools. Compulsory education in New Zealand spans 13 years, from primary school (ages 5-11) to secondary school (ages 11-18). International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Auckland and Wellington, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and Cambridge International Examinations.\n\nThe quality of education in New Zealand is generally high, with public schools being well-funded and staffed by qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, can offer smaller class sizes and more specialized programs, but often come with a higher price tag. International schools can provide a more global perspective and curriculum, but may also be more expensive than public or private schools. Overall, New Zealand's education system is well-regarded and provides students with a strong foundation for future success.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, well-funded schools |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Smaller class sizes, specialized programs |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Wide range of subjects and extracurricular activities |\n| Private Secondary | $5,000-$10,000 | Higher teacher-to-student ratio, more resources |\n| International School | $8,000-$20,000 | International curricula, global perspective |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $2,500-$5,000 | $10,000-$20,000 | Wide range of programs, research opportunities |\n| Private University | $5,000-$10,000 | $15,000-$30,000 | Smaller class sizes, specialized programs |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000-$10,000 | $20,000-$40,000 | University of Auckland, University of Otago |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Varied quality and availability |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Wide range of subjects and qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | English language courses, Maori language courses |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic materials, textbooks, and equipment |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Uniforms required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- New Zealand is known for its high-quality education system, with many schools ranked among the best in the world.\n- Expats often prefer international schools, which offer a global perspective and curriculum, but may be more expensive than public or private schools.\n- Scholarships are available for both local and international students, particularly for university programs.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular, with many universities and schools offering online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in New Zealand is generally high, but can vary depending on the school and region, with urban areas tend to have better-funded and higher-performing schools.\n- **English language proficiency** is a key requirement for international students, with many universities and schools offering language courses and support services to help students improve their English skills.",
