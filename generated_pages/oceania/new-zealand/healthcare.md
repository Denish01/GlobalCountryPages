[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
New Zealand's healthcare system is primarily public, with a strong emphasis on providing universal access to medical services. The system is funded through a combination of government funding and private health insurance. The quality of care is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there can be some discrepancies in access to healthcare services between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having fewer facilities and specialists. Despite this, the New Zealand government has made significant efforts to improve rural healthcare services, including the use of telemedicine and outreach clinics.

The public healthcare system in New Zealand is managed by District Health Boards (DHBs), which are responsible for providing healthcare services to their local populations. Private healthcare services are also available, including private hospitals and clinics, which can provide faster access to specialist care and more luxurious facilities. Expatriates and visitors can access both public and private healthcare services, although they may need to pay for some services or have private health insurance.

New Zealand's healthcare system is also committed to providing **cultural competency**, with a strong focus on providing care that is sensitive to the needs of different cultural groups, including Maori and Pacific Island peoples. This includes the use of interpreters and cultural advisors to ensure that patients receive care that is tailored to their cultural needs.
