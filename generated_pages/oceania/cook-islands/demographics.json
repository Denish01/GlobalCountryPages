  "content": "The Cook Islands are home to approximately 15,040 people, with a diverse population of Polynesian descent, speaking both English and Cook Islands Maori, and following various Christian denominations.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 15,040\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.6%\nMedian Age: 35 years\nUrban Population: 74%\nPopulation Density: 64 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 76 years\nFertility Rate: 2.8 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Cook Islands have a relatively small and stable population, with a slow growth rate due to low fertility rates and emigration to New Zealand and other countries. The population is predominantly urban, with the majority residing in the capital city of Avarua on the island of Rarotonga. The country's population size is comparable to that of small towns in other countries, and its growth trends are influenced by factors such as education, employment opportunities, and access to healthcare. Urbanization has been a significant trend in the Cook Islands, with many people moving from rural areas to the capital city in search of better job prospects and amenities.\n\nThe population of the Cook Islands is also influenced by migration patterns, with many Cook Islanders living and working abroad, particularly in New Zealand and Australia. This has led to a significant diaspora community, with many Cook Islanders maintaining strong ties to their homeland while also contributing to the economies of their host countries. The Cook Islands government has implemented various initiatives to encourage repatriation and retain skilled workers, but the country still faces challenges related to brain drain and population decline.\n\nThe country's population size and growth trends have significant implications for its economy, infrastructure, and social services. With a relatively small population, the Cook Islands face challenges in terms of economies of scale, and the government must carefully manage resources to ensure that the population's needs are met. The country's slow population growth rate also means that it must rely on immigration and foreign investment to drive economic growth and development.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cook Island Maori | 81% | Rarotonga, Aitutaki | Indigenous Polynesian people |\n| New Zealand European | 7% | Rarotonga | Descendants of European settlers |\n| Other Pacific Islanders | 6% | Rarotonga, outer islands | Includes Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans |\n| Chinese | 2% | Rarotonga | Descendants of Chinese immigrants |\n| Other ethnic groups | 4% | Rarotonga, outer islands | Includes Indians, Filipinos, and others |\n[/TABLE]\nThe Cook Islands are a culturally diverse country, with a majority of the population identifying as Cook Island Maori.
