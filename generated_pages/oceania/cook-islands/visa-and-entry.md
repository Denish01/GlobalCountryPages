[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Cook Islands before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The Cook Islands have a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa for short-term stays. The country offers visa-free access to citizens of over 40 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and many European nations. The visa policy is designed to promote tourism and facilitate travel to the islands, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders.

The Cook Islands' visa policy is also closely tied to that of New Zealand, as the country is a territory of New Zealand and many of its citizens hold New Zealand passports. As a result, citizens of countries that have a visa-free arrangement with New Zealand may also be eligible for visa-free entry to the Cook Islands. However, it is essential to note that the visa requirements for the Cook Islands may differ from those of New Zealand, so it is crucial to check the specific requirements before traveling.
