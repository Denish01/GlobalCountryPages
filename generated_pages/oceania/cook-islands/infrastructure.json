  "content": "The infrastructure in Cook Islands is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on providing essential services to the population, despite being a small island territory with limited resources.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 95% of population\nInternet Penetration: 54%\nRoad Network: 297 km, moderate quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Cook Islands have a relatively high level of infrastructure development compared to other Pacific Island nations. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the road network, improving water supply systems, and expanding telecommunications services. However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with Avarua, the capital, having better access to services and amenities than the outer islands. The government has been working to address this disparity, with initiatives aimed at improving the overall quality of life for all residents.\n\nThe Cook Islands' infrastructure development is also influenced by its relationship with New Zealand, which provides significant financial and technical support. This partnership has enabled the territory to leverage New Zealand's expertise and resources to enhance its infrastructure, particularly in areas such as energy and telecommunications. Despite these efforts, the Cook Islands still face challenges related to its remote location and limited economic resources, which can hinder the pace of infrastructure development.\n\nThe government has been actively seeking to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on external aid, which is expected to have a positive impact on the territory's infrastructure development in the long term. With a growing tourism industry and increasing investment in renewable energy, the Cook Islands are well-placed to continue improving their infrastructure and providing better services to residents and visitors alike.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 297 km | Moderate | Main roads are sealed, while secondary roads are often unpaved |\n| Railways | none | - | - |\n| Airports | 2 international, 5 domestic | Good | Rarotonga International Airport is the main hub |\n| Ports | 1 major | Moderate | Avatiu Harbour is the primary port, serving cargo and passenger ships |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The Cook Islands rely heavily on **fossil fuels** for power generation, with diesel-powered generators being the primary source of electricity.\n- The territory has made significant progress in recent years in increasing its use of **renewable energy**, with a focus on solar and wind power.\n- The government has set a target of generating 50% of the territory's electricity from renewable sources by 2025.\n- Power outages are relatively rare, but can occur during periods of high demand or when there are technical issues with the generators.\n- The Cook Islands are also exploring the potential for **geothermal energy** development, which could provide a sustainable and reliable source of power.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but may not be potable in rural areas, where water quality can be variable.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with most households having access to **septic tanks** or other forms of wastewater treatment.\n- Water access is a challenge in some rural areas, where residents may rely on **rainwater harvesting** or **wells** for their water supply.\n- The government has been working to improve water supply systems, including the construction of new **water treatment plants** and **distribution networks**.\n- **Wastewater management** is also a priority, with efforts to upgrade existing infrastructure and promote better waste disposal practices.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with most areas having access to 2G and 3G networks, and some areas having 4G coverage.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in urban areas, providing high-speed internet access to residents and businesses.\n- The government has been working to expand **telecommunications services** to rural areas, including the installation of new **cell towers** and **fiber-optic cables**.\n- **Postal services** are also available, with the Cook Islands Post Office providing mail and parcel delivery services to residents and businesses.\n- The territory is also exploring the potential for **submarine cables** to improve international connectivity and increase access to high-speed internet.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Cook Islands are currently undertaking a major **road upgrade project**, which aims to improve the quality and safety of the territory's road network.\n- The government has also launched a **renewable energy program**, which aims to increase the use of solar and wind power and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n- A new **water supply project** is underway, which will improve access to safe and reliable drinking water for residents in rural areas.\n- The Cook Islands are also participating in a regional **telecommunications project**, which aims to improve internet access and connectivity across the Pacific.\n- The territory is also exploring the potential for **tourism infrastructure development**, including the construction of new **hotels** and **resorts**, which is expected to boost the local economy and create new job opportunities.",
