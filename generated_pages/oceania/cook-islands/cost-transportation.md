[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The main transportation modes in Cook Islands are buses, taxis, and rental cars, with most people getting around by bus or on foot. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with buses running frequently on the main island of Rarotonga, but less frequently on the other islands. The bus network is extensive, covering most areas of the islands, but the frequency of buses can be limited, especially in rural areas.

The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on private vehicles or taxis to get around, especially at night or in rural areas. However, the islands are relatively small, and it's easy to get around on foot or by bike, especially in the capital city of Avarua. The scenic coastline and picturesque villages make walking or cycling a great way to explore the islands and take in the stunning scenery.
