Typical lease terms are for 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Residential Tenancies Act**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as French Polynesia and Samoa, Cook Islands' housing costs are relatively high, due to the country's remote location and limited supply of housing.\n\nThe Cook Islands government has implemented measures to regulate the housing market and protect tenants, including rent control and **tenant protection laws**. However, the demand for housing, particularly in the city center, remains high, driven by the growing tourism industry and the limited supply of accommodation. As a result, renters may face competition for available properties, and prices may be higher than in other parts of the Pacific.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $400-$600 | $300-$500 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $450-$700 | fully furnished, kitchen and bathroom, ocean views |\n| 2 Bedroom | $900-$1,400 | $700-$1,100 | family size, fully furnished, kitchen and bathroom, garden |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $900-$1,400 | spacious, fully furnished, kitchen and bathroom, ocean views |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $3,000-$5,000 | prime locations, ocean views, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $2,000-$3,500 | residential areas, family homes, garden |\n| Rural | $1,500-$2,500 | rural areas, coastal land, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Avarua**: the capital city, with a range of accommodation options, from apartments to houses, and a vibrant nightlife, typical rent range $600-$1,200 per month\n- **Muri**: a popular suburb, known for its beautiful beach and range of accommodation options, typical rent range $500-$1,000 per month\n- **Arorangi**: a family-friendly suburb, with a range of houses and apartments, and easy access to the city center, typical rent range $450-$900 per month\n- **Matavera**: a rural area, with a range of coastal land and properties, and stunning ocean views, typical rent range $400-$800 per month\n- **Titikaveka**: a suburban area, with a range of houses and apartments, and easy access to the city center, typical rent range $500-$1,000 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Cook Islands [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and understand the **rental laws** and regulations\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a property that meets your needs and budget\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease, and take photos and notes of any damage or issues\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, if possible, and consider renting outside of the city center for better value\n- Be aware of **scams** and never pay a deposit or rent without a signed lease and a receipt\n- Consider renting a **furnished** property, as this can be more convenient and cost-effective, especially for short-term rentals",
