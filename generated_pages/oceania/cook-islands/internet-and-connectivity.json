However, the urban-rural divide is still evident, with faster and more reliable connections available in Avarua and other urban centers, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet connection can also be affected by the weather, with heavy rainfall and strong winds sometimes disrupting services. Despite these challenges, the overall quality of the internet in Cook Islands is decent, making it possible to stay connected and work remotely, especially in urban areas.\n\nThe government and internet service providers have been working to improve the internet infrastructure, including the rollout of fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of mobile networks. However, the limited availability of internet services in rural areas remains a significant challenge, and visitors should be prepared for slower speeds and more frequent outages when traveling outside of urban centers. Additionally, the lack of competition in the market can result in higher prices and limited options for internet services, making it essential to research and compare providers before choosing a plan.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Cook Islands, visitors can purchase one from the main carriers, including Bluesky, Vodafone, and Telecom Cook Islands, at their respective stores or authorized retailers.

The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 20 USD, and data plans are available from around 10 USD per month for 1GB of data. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as they offer better coverage and more reliable services.\n\nThe main carriers in Cook Islands offer a range of plans and packages, including prepaid and postpaid options, making it easy to find a plan that suits your needs and budget. Visitors can also purchase a SIM card at the airport or from a local vendor, but it is essential to check the coverage and services offered by the provider before making a purchase.
