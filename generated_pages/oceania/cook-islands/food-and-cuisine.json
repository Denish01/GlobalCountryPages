Regional variations exist, with different islands having their own specialties, such as **Aitutaki**'s focus on seafood and **Rarotonga**'s emphasis on traditional Polynesian dishes.\n\nThe Cook Islands' food culture is also heavily influenced by its community-based society, with food playing a central role in social gatherings and celebrations. Traditional cooking methods, such as **umu** (earth oven) and **hangi** (steaming pit), are still used today, and are an important part of the country's cultural heritage. The use of local ingredients, such as **coconut milk** and **fresh fish**, is also a key aspect of Cook Islands cuisine, with many dishes featuring these ingredients as main components.\n\nIn addition to its traditional cuisine, the Cook Islands also offer a range of modern dining options, with many restaurants serving international cuisine, including European, Asian, and American dishes.
