Internet Penetration: 54%
Road Network: 297 km, moderate quality
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 2
Major Ports: 1
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Cook Islands have a relatively high level of infrastructure development compared to other Pacific Island nations. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the road network, improving water supply systems, and expanding telecommunications services. However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with Avarua, the capital, having better access to services and amenities than the outer islands. The government has been working to address this disparity, with initiatives aimed at improving the overall quality of life for all residents.

The Cook Islands' infrastructure development is also influenced by its relationship with New Zealand, which provides significant financial and technical support. This partnership has enabled the territory to leverage New Zealand's expertise and resources to enhance its infrastructure, particularly in areas such as energy and telecommunications. Despite these efforts, the Cook Islands still face challenges related to its remote location and limited economic resources, which can hinder the pace of infrastructure development.

The government has been actively seeking to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on external aid, which is expected to have a positive impact on the territory's infrastructure development in the long term. With a growing tourism industry and increasing investment in renewable energy, the Cook Islands are well-placed to continue improving their infrastructure and providing better services to residents and visitors alike.
