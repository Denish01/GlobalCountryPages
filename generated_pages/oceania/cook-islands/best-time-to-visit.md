[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Cook Islands have a tropical **subtropical** climate, with two main seasons: a dry season and a wet season. The dry season, from May to October, is characterized by warm temperatures, low humidity, and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit the islands. The wet season, from November to April, is marked by higher temperatures, increased humidity, and more frequent rainfall, with a higher risk of **cyclones**. The seasons affect travel in the Cook Islands, as the wet season can make some roads and trails impassable, and the dry season is the best time for outdoor activities such as **snorkeling**, **diving**, and **hiking**.

The Cook Islands are located in the **South Pacific**, where the climate is influenced by the trade winds and the **Intertropical Convergence Zone**. The islands' geography, with their coral reefs and volcanic mountains, also plays a role in shaping the local climate. The dry season is the best time to enjoy the islands' beautiful **beaches**, **lagoons**, and **island hopping** opportunities. The wet season, on the other hand, is a good time to see the islands' lush **vegetation** and **waterfalls** in full bloom.

The Cook Islands' climate is also affected by the **El Niño** and **La Niña** phenomena, which can bring more frequent and intense rainfall to the islands. However, the dry season is generally the best time to visit the Cook Islands, with warm temperatures, low humidity, and minimal rainfall making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploration.
