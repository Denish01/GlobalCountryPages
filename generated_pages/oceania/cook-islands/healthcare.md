The public healthcare system is generally free or low-cost for citizens and permanent residents, although there may be some charges for certain services, such as dental care or pharmaceuticals. Private healthcare providers, including clinics and hospitals, are also available, although these may be more expensive.

The quality of care in the Cook Islands is generally good, although there can be some limitations, especially in terms of specialized care. The country has a relatively high **life expectancy** and low **infant mortality rate**, indicating a generally good level of healthcare. However, there can be some challenges, especially in rural areas, where access to healthcare services may be limited. The Cook Islands also has a relatively high rate of **non-communicable diseases**, such as diabetes and heart disease, which can be a challenge for the healthcare system.
