[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Cook Islands is relatively small, with a limited supply of apartments and houses, particularly in the city center of Avarua. Typical lease terms are for 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Residential Tenancies Act**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as French Polynesia and Samoa, Cook Islands' housing costs are relatively high, due to the country's remote location and limited supply of housing.

The Cook Islands government has implemented measures to regulate the housing market and protect tenants, including rent control and **tenant protection laws**. However, the demand for housing, particularly in the city center, remains high, driven by the growing tourism industry and the limited supply of accommodation. As a result, renters may face competition for available properties, and prices may be higher than in other parts of the Pacific.
