# Cook Islands Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

The culture of the Cook Islands is a unique blend of Polynesian traditions, New Zealand influences, and a strong sense of community, shaped by the country's history, language, and geography.

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
The Cook Islands' culture is defined by its rich Polynesian heritage, with a strong emphasis on family, respect for elders, and a deep connection to the land and sea. The country's ethnic makeup is predominantly Cook Islands Maori, with a significant influence from European and New Zealand cultures. The official languages are English and Cook Islands Maori, also known as Rarotongan, which is widely spoken throughout the islands. The Cook Islands' cultural identity is also reflected in its traditional arts, music, and dance, which are an integral part of everyday life.

The country's history has played a significant role in shaping its cultural identity, with the arrival of European settlers and missionaries in the 19th century introducing new customs, languages, and beliefs. However, the Cook Islands have managed to maintain their unique cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on preserving traditional practices and customs. The country's geographic location, with its 15 islands scattered across the South Pacific, has also contributed to the development of a distinct cultural identity, with each island having its own unique characteristics and traditions.

The Cook Islands' cultural identity is also reflected in its values, which prioritize community, respect, and cooperation. The concept of **"aronga mana"**, or respect for others, is a fundamental aspect of Cook Islands culture, and is reflected in the way people interact with each other, with a strong emphasis on politeness, courtesy, and hospitality. The country's cultural identity is also closely tied to its natural environment, with a deep respect for the land, sea, and natural resources.
