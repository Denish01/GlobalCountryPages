[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main airport in the Cook Islands is the Rarotonga International Airport, which is located on the island of Rarotonga. This airport receives direct flights from Auckland, New Zealand, as well as connections from other Pacific Island nations. There are no overland entry points to the Cook Islands, as the country is an archipelago of 15 islands in the South Pacific Ocean. The most common way to arrive in the Cook Islands is by air, and the airport is well-connected to the rest of the world through flights from major airlines such as Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia.

International visitors typically fly into Rarotonga International Airport, where they can clear customs and immigration before proceeding to their final destination. The airport is relatively small, but it has all the necessary facilities, including a currency exchange, a restaurant, and a few shops. From the airport, visitors can take a taxi or bus to their accommodation, or rent a car to explore the island. There are also several tour operators that offer transfers from the airport to hotels and resorts around the island.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The domestic air network in the Cook Islands is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between the islands. Air Rarotonga is the main domestic airline, and it operates flights to several of the outer islands, including Aitutaki, Atiu, and Mauke. The flights are relatively expensive, but they offer a convenient way to travel between the islands. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak season, as the flights can fill up quickly. The cost of domestic flights varies depending on the route and the time of year, but approximate costs range from $100 to $300 per person for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in the Cook Islands, as the country is a small archipelago with limited land area. As a result, there are no trains or railways to speak of, and the main mode of transportation is by road or air.

There are bus services available on the main island of Rarotonga, with several companies operating routes around the island. The buses are relatively frequent, but the service can be limited on the outer islands.
