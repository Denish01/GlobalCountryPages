  "content": "To get around in the Cook Islands, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and car rentals, as the country has a limited but reliable transportation network. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Rarotonga International Airport, RAR\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe main airport in the Cook Islands is the Rarotonga International Airport, which is located on the island of Rarotonga. This airport receives direct flights from Auckland, New Zealand, as well as connections from other Pacific Island nations. There are no overland entry points to the Cook Islands, as the country is an archipelago of 15 islands in the South Pacific Ocean. The most common way to arrive in the Cook Islands is by air, and the airport is well-connected to the rest of the world through flights from major airlines such as Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia.\n\nInternational visitors typically fly into Rarotonga International Airport, where they can clear customs and immigration before proceeding to their final destination. The airport is relatively small, but it has all the necessary facilities, including a currency exchange, a restaurant, and a few shops. From the airport, visitors can take a taxi or bus to their accommodation, or rent a car to explore the island. There are also several tour operators that offer transfers from the airport to hotels and resorts around the island.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in the Cook Islands is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between the islands. Air Rarotonga is the main domestic airline, and it operates flights to several of the outer islands, including Aitutaki, Atiu, and Mauke. The flights are relatively expensive, but they offer a convenient way to travel between the islands. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak season, as the flights can fill up quickly. The cost of domestic flights varies depending on the route and the time of year, but approximate costs range from $100 to $300 per person for a one-way ticket.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in the Cook Islands, as the country is a small archipelago with limited land area. As a result, there are no trains or railways to speak of, and the main mode of transportation is by road or air.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThere are bus services available on the main island of Rarotonga, with several companies operating routes around the island. The buses are relatively frequent, but the service can be limited on the outer islands. The cost of bus travel is relatively cheap, with fares starting from around $2 to $5 per person for a one-way ticket. The buses are a good way to get around the island, especially for short distances, and they offer a convenient and affordable alternative to taxis or car rentals.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Rarotonga | $2-$5 | Frequent services around the island |\n| Taxi | Rarotonga, Aitutaki | $10-$20/km | Available at the airport and in towns |\n| Ride-Hailing | Rarotonga | $10-$20 | Local alternatives to Uber and Grab |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Not available | - | Not available in the Cook Islands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in the Cook Islands, you need to have a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a **Cook Islands driving permit**, which can be obtained from the police station on Rarotonga.\n- The road conditions in the Cook Islands are generally moderate, with some paved roads and some unpaved roads, especially on the outer islands.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high in the Cook Islands, due to the remote location of the country.\n- Car rental companies are available on Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and they offer a range of vehicles, including cars, scooters, and bicycles.\n- When driving in the Cook Islands, be aware of the **left-hand traffic** rule, and always wear a seatbelt.\n- Be careful when driving on the outer islands, as the roads can be narrow and winding, and there may be **hazards such as potholes and livestock** on the road.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams and overcharging** by taxi drivers, and always agree on a fare before you start your journey.\n- Use **local currency**, the New Zealand dollar, to pay for transportation, as not all operators accept credit cards.\n- Download the **Cook Islands app** to get information on transportation options and schedules.\n- Always wear a **seatbelt** when driving or riding in a vehicle.\n- Be respectful of **local customs and traditions** when using public transportation.\n- Consider **renting a scooter or bicycle** to get around the island, as it is a convenient and affordable way to explore.\n- Be aware of the **limited transportation options** on the outer islands, and plan your itinerary accordingly.\n- Use **reputable transportation operators** to ensure your safety and security.",
