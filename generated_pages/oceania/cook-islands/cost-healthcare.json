Public healthcare services are generally more affordable and accessible to locals, with many services being free or low-cost. However, the quality of care can vary, and some specialized services may not be available. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care and a wider range of services, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as public healthcare services may not be available to them.\n\nThe healthcare system in Cook Islands is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. The ministry operates several hospitals and health centers throughout the country, including the Rarotonga Hospital, which is the main hospital on the island. In addition to public healthcare services, there are also several private healthcare providers, including clinics and hospitals, that offer specialized services such as dental care and eye exams. For foreigners, it is recommended to research and purchase insurance that covers medical expenses before traveling to Cook Islands, as medical care can be expensive and may not be covered by local insurance providers.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics offer free or low-cost consultations, but may have limited hours and services |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may offer more specialized care, but at a higher cost |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Public dental clinics offer free or low-cost checkups, but may have limited services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may offer more comprehensive eye exams, but at a higher cost |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Public labs offer free or low-cost blood tests, but may have limited services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public hospitals offer free or low-cost emergency services, but may have limited resources |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable and private rooms, but at a higher cost |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | Public hospitals offer free or low-cost surgical services, but may have limited specialized care |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,500 | Private hospitals offer more comprehensive and personalized care, but at a higher cost |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Private clinics offer more advanced imaging services, but at a higher cost |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals offer free or low-cost X-ray services, but may have limited resources |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers private healthcare services, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers medical expenses worldwide, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and pain relievers are available at public pharmacies and clinics, and may be free or low-cost for locals.\n- Prescription medications may require a doctor's consultation and may be more expensive, with costs ranging from $10-$50 per prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medications are available at private pharmacies and may be more expensive, with costs ranging from $10-$30 per item.\n- Pharmacy services are generally available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Some medications may not be available in Cook Islands, and may need to be imported from other countries.\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medications with you when traveling to Cook Islands, as they may not be available locally.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 998, or to visit the nearest hospital or clinic.
