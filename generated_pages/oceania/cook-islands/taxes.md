[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
The Cook Islands have a **territorial tax system**, which means that only income earned within the country is subject to taxation. This is in contrast to a worldwide taxation system, where all income earned by a taxpayer, regardless of where it is earned, is subject to taxation. The Cook Islands' tax system is designed to encourage foreign investment and tourism, with a range of incentives and exemptions available to businesses and individuals. To be considered a tax resident in the Cook Islands, an individual must be physically present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year, or have a permanent home in the country and be absent for no more than 183 days in a calendar year.

The Cook Islands' tax system is relatively simple, with a focus on **income tax**, **corporate tax**, and **value-added tax (VAT)**.

The government has implemented a range of measures to encourage foreign investment and economic growth, including tax incentives and exemptions for certain types of businesses. The Cook Islands also have a range of **double taxation treaties** in place, which aim to prevent taxation of the same income in multiple countries.
