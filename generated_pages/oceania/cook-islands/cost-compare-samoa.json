However, when it comes to cost of living, there are significant differences between the two countries. The Cook Islands has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed economy, which translates to higher prices for goods and services.

Overall, Samoa is the cheaper option, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. The Cook Islands has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism and financial services, which drives up prices.
