[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The Cook Islands have a unique linguistic landscape, with both English and Cook Islands Maori being official languages. Cook Islands Maori, also known as Rarotongan, is an Austronesian language and the indigenous language of the islands. It is still widely spoken among the local population, particularly in traditional and cultural contexts. English, on the other hand, is the primary language used for government, education, and tourism, and is widely understood by the majority of the population. There are also some regional dialects, such as Penrhyn and Pukapukan, which are spoken on the outer islands. Despite these dialects, English is the dominant language used for communication among tourists and locals, and visitors can easily get by without speaking Cook Islands Maori.

The widespread use of English in the Cook Islands is a result of the country's historical ties with New Zealand, as well as the growing tourism industry. Many locals, particularly in the service industry, speak English fluently, making it easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the islands. However, learning a few basic phrases in Cook Islands Maori can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people. Cook Islands Maori is an important part of the country's identity, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote the language, particularly among the younger generation.

In addition to English and Cook Islands Maori, there are also some minority languages spoken in the Cook Islands, such as Tahitian and Niuean, which are spoken by smaller communities of immigrants. However, these languages are not as widely spoken as English and Cook Islands Maori, and visitors are unlikely to encounter them during their stay. Overall, the linguistic landscape of the Cook Islands is characterized by a mix of indigenous and foreign languages, with English being the dominant language used for communication among tourists and locals.
