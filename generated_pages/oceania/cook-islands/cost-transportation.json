The quality of public transit is relatively good, with buses running frequently on the main island of Rarotonga, but less frequently on the other islands. The bus network is extensive, covering most areas of the islands, but the frequency of buses can be limited, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on private vehicles or taxis to get around, especially at night or in rural areas. However, the islands are relatively small, and it's easy to get around on foot or by bike, especially in the capital city of Avarua. The scenic coastline and picturesque villages make walking or cycling a great way to explore the islands and take in the stunning scenery.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $60 | Good coverage, frequent buses |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly for airport transfers |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$20 | Available at airports and in main towns |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking spaces available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mainly between main islands |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, depending on airline and time of year |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider buying a monthly bus pass or renting a car for a day to explore the islands.\n- Use reputable taxi companies and always agree on the fare before you start your journey.\n- Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night, and avoid walking alone in isolated areas.\n- Consider renting a bike or scooter to get around the islands, especially on Rarotonga.\n- Always wear a helmet when cycling, as road safety can be a concern.\n- Download the **Cook Islands** tourism app to get the latest information on transportation options and schedules.",
