  "content": "The Cook Islands, a territory of New Zealand, is often misunderstood as a small, insignificant island chain, but in reality, it has a rich history, unique culture, and distinct geography that sets it apart from other Pacific island nations.\n\n[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nThe Cook Islands were first settled by Polynesian people around 1000 AD, with the islands being divided into three distinct groups: the Northern Cook Islands, the Southern Cook Islands, and the island of Aitutaki. In 1821, the first European, a British sailor named John Dibbs, arrived on the islands, marking the beginning of European influence. The Cook Islands became a British protectorate in 1888, and in 1901, they were annexed by New Zealand. The islands gained self-government in 1965, but they remain a territory of New Zealand to this day. The Cook Islands have a **constitutional monarchy** system, with the New Zealand monarch serving as the head of state.\n\nThe Cook Islands' history is also marked by significant events such as the arrival of Christian missionaries in the 19th century, which had a profound impact on the islands' culture and society.

Today, the Cook Islands are a **parliamentary democracy**, with a prime minister and a unicameral legislature.
