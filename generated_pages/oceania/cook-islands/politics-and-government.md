[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Cook Islands' political system is based on a constitutional monarchy, with the King of New Zealand serving as the head of state, represented by the Queen's Representative. The Prime Minister is the head of government, and is responsible for advising the Queen's Representative on the governance of the country. The Parliament of the Cook Islands is a unicameral legislature, consisting of 24 members elected by the people for a term of four years. The political system is characterized by a separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

The Cook Islands has a unitary system of government, with the central government responsible for most areas of governance. However, there are also local governments on each of the 15 islands that make up the country, which have some degree of autonomy in areas such as education and healthcare. The country's constitution provides for a system of checks and balances, with the Parliament able to hold the government accountable for its actions.

The Cook Islands' political system is also influenced by its relationship with New Zealand, which provides defense and foreign affairs services to the country. The Cook Islands is self-governing in most areas, but New Zealand retains responsibility for certain areas such as defense and foreign affairs. This relationship is governed by a number of agreements and treaties, including the Cook Islands Constitution Act 1964 and the Treaty of Rarotonga.
