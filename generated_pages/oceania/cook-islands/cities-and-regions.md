The Cook Islands are an archipelago of 15 islands, with a total land area of 236 km². The islands are divided into two main groups: the Northern Cook Islands and the Southern Cook Islands. The Southern Cook Islands are further divided into five islands, with Rarotonga being the largest and most populous island. Each island has its own local government, with the capital Avarua serving as the administrative center of the territory. The Cook Islands have a unique system of government, with a mix of traditional and modern elements. The islands are self-governing in free association with New Zealand, which provides defense and foreign affairs support.

The administrative structure of the Cook Islands is designed to balance the needs of the individual islands with the needs of the territory as a whole. The Cook Islands Parliament is the national legislature, with representatives elected from each of the islands. The Parliament is responsible for making laws and overseeing the government, which is headed by a Prime Minister. The local governments of each island have a significant degree of autonomy, with responsibility for providing services such as education, health, and infrastructure.
