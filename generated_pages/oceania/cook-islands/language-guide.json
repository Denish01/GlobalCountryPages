  "content": "The primary languages spoken in the Cook Islands are English and Cook Islands Maori, with English being widely understood and used as the main language for communication among tourists and locals.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): English, Cook Islands Maori\nWidely Spoken: \nEnglish Proficiency: High\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Austronesian\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Cook Islands have a unique linguistic landscape, with both English and Cook Islands Maori being official languages. Cook Islands Maori, also known as Rarotongan, is an Austronesian language and the indigenous language of the islands. It is still widely spoken among the local population, particularly in traditional and cultural contexts. English, on the other hand, is the primary language used for government, education, and tourism, and is widely understood by the majority of the population. There are also some regional dialects, such as Penrhyn and Pukapukan, which are spoken on the outer islands. Despite these dialects, English is the dominant language used for communication among tourists and locals, and visitors can easily get by without speaking Cook Islands Maori.\n\nThe widespread use of English in the Cook Islands is a result of the country's historical ties with New Zealand, as well as the growing tourism industry. Many locals, particularly in the service industry, speak English fluently, making it easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the islands. However, learning a few basic phrases in Cook Islands Maori can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people. Cook Islands Maori is an important part of the country's identity, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote the language, particularly among the younger generation.\n\nIn addition to English and Cook Islands Maori, there are also some minority languages spoken in the Cook Islands, such as Tahitian and Niuean, which are spoken by smaller communities of immigrants. However, these languages are not as widely spoken as English and Cook Islands Maori, and visitors are unlikely to encounter them during their stay. Overall, the linguistic landscape of the Cook Islands is characterized by a mix of indigenous and foreign languages, with English being the dominant language used for communication among tourists and locals.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Kia orana | kee-ah oh-rah-nah | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Kia ora | kee-ah oh-rah | informal |\n| Thank you | Meitaki | may-tah-kee |  |\n| Please | Ko na mauru | koh nah mah-roo |  |\n| Yes / No | Ai / Kao | eye / kah-oh |  |\n| Excuse me | Mauru | mah-roo |  |\n| How much? | E hia te moni | eh hee-ah teh moh-nee |  |\n| Where is...? | Kofea...? | koh-feh-ah |  |\n| I don't understand | Kaore au e tae | kah-oh-reh ah-oo eh tah-eh |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Ka korero koe i te reo Pakeha? | kah koh-reh-roh koh-eh ee teh reh-oh pah-keh-hah |  |\n| Help! | Aukati! | ah-oo-kah-tee |  |\n| Goodbye | Ka kite | kah kee-teh |  |\n| Sorry | Mauru | mah-roo |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Tahi | tah-hee |\n| 2 | Rua | roo-ah |\n| 3 | Toru | toh-roo |\n| 4 | Wha | fah |\n| 5 | Rima | ree-mah |\n| 6 | Ono | oh-noh |\n| 7 | Whitu | fee-too |\n| 8 | Waru | wah-roo |\n| 9 | Iwa | ee-wah |\n| 10 | Tekau | teh-kah-oo |\n| 100 | Rau | rah-oo |\n| 1000 | Tini | tee-nee |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of the local culture and traditions, and try to learn a few basic phrases in Cook Islands Maori.\n- Use formal language when interacting with elders or in traditional settings.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the feet or touching someone's head.\n- Use body language to show respect, such as bowing the head or using open and relaxed gestures.\n- Be patient and take the time to listen to and understand the local language and customs.\n- Avoid interrupting or talking over others, and show respect for the speaker.\n- Use a calm and gentle tone of voice, and avoid loud or aggressive language.\n- Learn about the local customs and traditions, and try to participate in cultural activities and events.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a language course or class to learn more about Cook Islands Maori and the local culture.\n- Listen to local music and watch local movies to get a feel for the language and culture.\n- Practice speaking with locals and try to engage in conversations to improve your language skills.",
