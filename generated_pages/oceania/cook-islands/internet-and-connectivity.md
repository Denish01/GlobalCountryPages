[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Cook Islands has improved significantly over the years, with the average internet speed reaching 10 Mbps download. However, the urban-rural divide is still evident, with faster and more reliable connections available in Avarua and other urban centers, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet connection can also be affected by the weather, with heavy rainfall and strong winds sometimes disrupting services. Despite these challenges, the overall quality of the internet in Cook Islands is decent, making it possible to stay connected and work remotely, especially in urban areas.

The government and internet service providers have been working to improve the internet infrastructure, including the rollout of fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of mobile networks. However, the limited availability of internet services in rural areas remains a significant challenge, and visitors should be prepared for slower speeds and more frequent outages when traveling outside of urban centers. Additionally, the lack of competition in the market can result in higher prices and limited options for internet services, making it essential to research and compare providers before choosing a plan.
