[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Cook Islands is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare services are generally more affordable and accessible to locals, with many services being free or low-cost. However, the quality of care can vary, and some specialized services may not be available. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care and a wider range of services, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as public healthcare services may not be available to them.

The healthcare system in Cook Islands is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. The ministry operates several hospitals and health centers throughout the country, including the Rarotonga Hospital, which is the main hospital on the island. In addition to public healthcare services, there are also several private healthcare providers, including clinics and hospitals, that offer specialized services such as dental care and eye exams. For foreigners, it is recommended to research and purchase insurance that covers medical expenses before traveling to Cook Islands, as medical care can be expensive and may not be covered by local insurance providers.
