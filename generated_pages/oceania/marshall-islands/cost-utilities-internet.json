As a result, the cost of utilities can be high and fluctuating, especially during seasonal variations such as droughts or typhoons. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the progress has been slow, and the costs remain relatively high.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Marshall Islands can also vary depending on the location, with urban areas like Majuro tend to have higher costs than rural areas. Additionally, the costs can be affected by the availability of resources, such as fuel and water, which can be scarce during certain times of the year. Overall, the utility costs in Marshall Islands are relatively high compared to other countries in the region, but the government and private sector are working to improve the infrastructure and reduce the costs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10-20 Mbps | Marshalls Telecom, NTA |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-120 | 50-100 Mbps | Marshalls Telecom, NTA |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-30 | 1-10 GB | Marshalls Telecom, NTA |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-60 | 10-20 GB | Marshalls Telecom, NTA |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | Marshalls Telecom, NTA |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited content) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the local utility providers, such as Marshalls Telecom or NTA, and provide the necessary documents, such as a passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but they can be more expensive than postpaid plans, and it is recommended to choose a postpaid plan if possible.\n- The best internet providers in Marshall Islands are Marshalls Telecom and NTA, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use a water tank to collect rainwater.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with the utility providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
