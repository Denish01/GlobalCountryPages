[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and facilities, while private healthcare providers offer higher quality care but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary source of care, while foreigners and those who can afford it may opt for private healthcare. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients paying out-of-pocket for services or using insurance to cover costs. While insurance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical evacuation to other countries may be necessary in case of serious illness or injury.

The quality of healthcare in the Marshall Islands can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. In the capital city of Majuro, there are several private hospitals and clinics that offer high-quality care, while in more rural areas, healthcare facilities may be limited and of lower quality. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care at private facilities, which may have more English-speaking staff and better equipment. However, even at private facilities, the cost of healthcare can be high, and insurance may be necessary to cover costs.
