[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands, a sovereign nation in Oceania, faces significant challenges in developing its infrastructure. With a population of approximately 42,418 people, the country's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development. Recent investments have focused on improving the road network, expanding access to electricity, and enhancing telecommunications. However, there is a notable urban-rural gap, with the capital city Majuro having better infrastructure than the outer islands. The government has been working to address these disparities, but progress is slow due to limited resources and geographical constraints.

The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its **geographical location**, which makes it vulnerable to natural disasters such as typhoons and rising sea levels. Despite these challenges, the Marshall Islands have made significant progress in recent years, with the help of international organizations and donor countries. The government has implemented various projects to improve the infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, the expansion of the airport, and the development of renewable energy sources.

The Marshall Islands' infrastructure development is critical to the country's economic growth and social development. The government has recognized the need to invest in infrastructure to attract foreign investment, promote economic growth, and improve the living standards of its citizens. With the help of international organizations and donor countries, the Marshall Islands are working to develop a more robust and resilient infrastructure that can support the country's long-term development goals.
