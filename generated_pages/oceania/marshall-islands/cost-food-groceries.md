[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Marshall Islands are higher than the regional average due to the country's geographical isolation and limited local production. The cost of living in Marshall Islands is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which increases the price of imported goods, including food. As a result, eating out can be expensive, and home cooking is a more affordable option for many residents. The eating-out culture in Marshall Islands is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many people preferring to cook at home using local ingredients and traditional recipes.

The high cost of food in Marshall Islands is also due to the limited availability of fresh produce, which is often imported from other countries. This can make it difficult for residents to access affordable and healthy food options, particularly in the outer islands where transportation costs are even higher. However, the government and local organizations are working to promote local food production and reduce reliance on imports, which could help to drive down food prices in the future.
