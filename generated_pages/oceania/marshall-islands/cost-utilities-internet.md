[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Marshall Islands is relatively underdeveloped, with most of the population relying on diesel generators for electricity and rainwater collection systems for water. As a result, the cost of utilities can be high and fluctuating, especially during seasonal variations such as droughts or typhoons. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the progress has been slow, and the costs remain relatively high.

The cost of utilities in Marshall Islands can also vary depending on the location, with urban areas like Majuro tend to have higher costs than rural areas. Additionally, the costs can be affected by the availability of resources, such as fuel and water, which can be scarce during certain times of the year. Overall, the utility costs in Marshall Islands are relatively high compared to other countries in the region, but the government and private sector are working to improve the infrastructure and reduce the costs.
