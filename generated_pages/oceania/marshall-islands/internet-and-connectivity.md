[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Marshall Islands is characterized by slow speeds and limited availability, particularly in rural areas. The average internet speed is around 5 Mbps download, which can make it challenging to stream videos or engage in other bandwidth-intensive activities. The urban vs rural divide is significant, with Majuro, the capital, having better internet connectivity than the outer islands. However, even in urban areas, the internet can be unreliable, with frequent outages and slow speeds. This is due to the country's remote location and limited infrastructure, which makes it difficult to maintain a stable and fast internet connection.

The reliability of the internet in Marshall Islands is also a concern, with outages and disruptions occurring frequently. This can be frustrating for visitors who rely on the internet to stay in touch with family and friends or to work remotely. However, the government and local internet service providers are working to improve the internet infrastructure and increase connectivity throughout the country. Despite the challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for the people of Marshall Islands, and efforts are being made to expand access and improve quality.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Marshall Islands, visitors can purchase one from the National Telecommunications Authority (NTA) or other local carriers such as MTM or FSMTC. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, and it usually comes with a limited amount of data. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will need to provide a valid passport and may need to register with the local authorities. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as some smaller providers may not offer reliable service. Data plans are available, but they can be expensive, and the speeds are generally slow.

The main carriers in Marshall Islands offer a range of plans, including prepaid and postpaid options. Visitors can choose a plan that suits their needs, but it is essential to check the coverage and speeds in their area before purchasing a SIM card.
