The typical lease term is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Marshall Islands' law, but the enforcement of these rights can be inconsistent. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Kiribati and Micronesia, the housing costs in Marshall Islands are relatively moderate. However, the limited availability of housing and the high cost of living in the country can make it challenging for expats and locals alike to find affordable housing options.\n\nThe housing market in Marshall Islands is also influenced by the country's remote location and limited economic opportunities. The majority of the population lives in the capital city of Majuro, which has led to a shortage of housing options and increased competition for available rentals. Additionally, the high cost of importing goods and materials to the country has driven up the cost of construction and maintenance, making it even more challenging for people to afford housing. Despite these challenges, the Marshall Islands government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing market, including the development of new housing projects and the provision of subsidies for low-income families.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | small, basic units |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$650 | $250-$450 | compact, standard amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $350-$600 | medium size, some amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $450-$800 | spacious, full amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$3,500 | prime locations, limited availability |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | residential areas, some amenities |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,000 | limited access to amenities, scenic views |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Delap** neighborhood: $400-$700 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its central location and access to amenities\n- **Rita** neighborhood: $300-$600 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a popular area for expats and locals alike\n- **Uliga** neighborhood: $500-$900 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, offers a range of amenities and services\n- **Laura** neighborhood: $250-$500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a more affordable option with limited amenities\n- **Ebay** neighborhood: $350-$700 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a mix of residential and commercial areas\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Marshall Islands [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and work with a reputable real estate agent to find available rentals\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market is competitive and properties can rent quickly\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, as prices can be flexible\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that you are working with a legitimate landlord or property manager\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are less common, so be prepared to provide your own furniture and appliances if necessary\n- Consider working with a local expert or expat community to find housing and navigate the rental market.",
