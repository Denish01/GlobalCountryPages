The population growth rate is approximately 1.7%, which is relatively high compared to other countries. The population is predominantly young, with a median age of 20.3 years.

The life expectancy at birth is around 67.8 years, and the fertility rate is approximately 3.5 children per woman.\n\nThe population growth trend in the Marshall Islands is influenced by factors such as high birth rates, limited access to healthcare and family planning services, and a relatively young population. Urbanization is also a significant trend, with many people migrating from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities, education, and healthcare. However, this trend also poses challenges, such as overcrowding, inadequate housing, and strain on public services. The government and international organizations are working to address these challenges and promote sustainable development, including investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure.\n\nThe Marshall Islands also experiences migration patterns, with many citizens traveling to other countries for education, work, or other opportunities. The United States is a popular destination, particularly for those seeking higher education or employment. However, this migration can also lead to brain drain and loss of skilled workers, which can have negative impacts on the local economy and development.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Marshallese | 92.1% | Throughout the islands | Indigenous people of the Marshall Islands |\n| Other Micronesian | 4.5% | Throughout the islands | Includes people from neighboring Micronesian countries |\n| Asian | 1.5% | Majuro and Ebeye | Mainly Chinese and Filipino immigrants |\n| European | 0.5% | Majuro and Ebeye | Mainly American and Australian expatriates |\n| Other | 1.4% | Throughout the islands | Includes people of mixed ethnicity and other minority groups |\n[/TABLE]\nThe Marshall Islands is a culturally diverse country, with a range of ethnic groups contributing to its rich heritage.
