[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Marshall Islands is relatively small, with a limited supply of housing options, particularly in the capital city of Majuro. The typical lease term is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Marshall Islands' law, but the enforcement of these rights can be inconsistent. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Kiribati and Micronesia, the housing costs in Marshall Islands are relatively moderate. However, the limited availability of housing and the high cost of living in the country can make it challenging for expats and locals alike to find affordable housing options.

The housing market in Marshall Islands is also influenced by the country's remote location and limited economic opportunities. The majority of the population lives in the capital city of Majuro, which has led to a shortage of housing options and increased competition for available rentals. Additionally, the high cost of importing goods and materials to the country has driven up the cost of construction and maintenance, making it even more challenging for people to afford housing. Despite these challenges, the Marshall Islands government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing market, including the development of new housing projects and the provision of subsidies for low-income families.
