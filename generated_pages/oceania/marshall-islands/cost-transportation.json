The country has a limited road network, and most people get around by walking, cycling, or using taxis. The quality of public transit is relatively poor, with limited bus services available on the main islands of Majuro and Ebeye. However, the government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of a new port and improvements to the airport.\n\nThe most common mode of transportation in the Marshall Islands is by boat, with many residents owning their own boats or using ferry services to travel between islands. The country also has a domestic air service, which connects the main islands. Taxis are widely available, but the cost can be high, especially for longer trips. The lack of a well-developed public transportation system makes it difficult for people to get around, especially in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-$2 | $20 | Limited coverage, mainly on Majuro and Ebeye |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly on Majuro and Ebeye |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2-$3 | $10-$20 | Available on Majuro and Ebeye |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, by taxi or private car |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.40 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $50-$100 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited services, mainly on Majuro and Ebeye |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, Majuro to Ebeye |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best way to get around the Marshall Islands is by boat or air, as the road network is limited.\n- Taxis are widely available, but the cost can be high, so it's best to negotiate the fare before starting your journey.\n- There are no ride-hailing apps available in the Marshall Islands, so it's best to use traditional taxis or private cars.\n- Fuel prices can be high, so it's best to plan your journeys carefully and consider carpooling or using public transportation.\n- The Marshall Islands are a chain of islands, and the weather can be unpredictable, so it's best to plan your journeys according to the weather forecast.\n- It's also a good idea to learn some basic Marshallese phrases, such as \"kommol\" (hello) and \"kwoj\" (thank you), to help you get around and communicate with the locals.",
