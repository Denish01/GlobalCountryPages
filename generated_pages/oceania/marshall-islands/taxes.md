The country's tax system is relatively simple, with a focus on taxing business and individual income. Residency rules for tax purposes are based on physical presence, with individuals considered residents if they are present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year.

The Marshall Islands government has implemented various measures to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth, including a relatively low corporate tax rate and a lack of **value-added tax (VAT)** or **goods and services tax (GST)**. The country's tax system is also characterized by a lack of tax treaties with other countries, which can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to navigate international tax obligations. However, the country has agreements with certain countries for international cooperation and tax information exchange, which can help to prevent tax evasion and promote transparency.
