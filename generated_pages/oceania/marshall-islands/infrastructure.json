  "content": "The infrastructure in Marshall Islands is relatively underdeveloped, with limitations in roads, power, and water supply, although recent investments have aimed to improve the overall development level. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 87% of population\nInternet Penetration: 21%\nRoad Network: 150 km, moderate quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Marshall Islands, a sovereign nation in Oceania, faces significant challenges in developing its infrastructure. With a population of approximately 42,418 people, the country's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development. Recent investments have focused on improving the road network, expanding access to electricity, and enhancing telecommunications. However, there is a notable urban-rural gap, with the capital city Majuro having better infrastructure than the outer islands. The government has been working to address these disparities, but progress is slow due to limited resources and geographical constraints.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its **geographical location**, which makes it vulnerable to natural disasters such as typhoons and rising sea levels. Despite these challenges, the Marshall Islands have made significant progress in recent years, with the help of international organizations and donor countries. The government has implemented various projects to improve the infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, the expansion of the airport, and the development of renewable energy sources.\n\nThe Marshall Islands' infrastructure development is critical to the country's economic growth and social development. The government has recognized the need to invest in infrastructure to attract foreign investment, promote economic growth, and improve the living standards of its citizens. With the help of international organizations and donor countries, the Marshall Islands are working to develop a more robust and resilient infrastructure that can support the country's long-term development goals.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 150 km | Moderate | Mostly unpaved, prone to flooding |\n| Railways | none | - | - |\n| Airports | 4 international, 2 domestic | Good | Regular flights to neighboring countries |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Limited cargo handling capacity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The Marshall Islands rely heavily on **imported diesel fuel** for power generation, which is expensive and subject to price fluctuations.\n- The country has made significant progress in recent years in expanding access to electricity, with approximately 87% of the population now having access to electricity.\n- However, the power supply is not always reliable, with frequent **outages** and **power shortages** due to the high cost of fuel and the limited capacity of the power grid.\n- The government has been promoting the use of **renewable energy sources**, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on imported fuel and mitigate the impact of climate change.\n- The Marshall Islands have set a goal to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix to 20% by 2025, with the help of international organizations and donor countries.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- The Marshall Islands face significant challenges in providing safe and reliable **tap water** to its citizens, with many households relying on **rainwater collection** and **wells** for their water needs.\n- The country's **sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many households lacking access to proper **sewage disposal** and **waste management** facilities.\n- The government has been working to improve access to **clean water** and **sanitation** facilities, particularly in rural areas, with the help of international organizations and donor countries.\n- However, the country's **water resources** are vulnerable to **climate change**, with rising sea levels and increased rainfall variability posing significant threats to the country's water security.\n- The Marshall Islands have implemented various projects to improve the water and sanitation infrastructure, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the expansion of the sewage system.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- The Marshall Islands have made significant progress in recent years in expanding access to **mobile phone services**, with approximately 21% of the population now having access to the internet.\n- The country's **mobile coverage** is relatively good, with most areas having access to **2G** and **3G** networks, although **4G** coverage is still limited.\n- The government has been promoting the use of **information and communication technologies (ICTs)** to improve access to education, healthcare, and other essential services.\n- However, the country's **telecommunications infrastructure** is still in the early stages of development, with limited **fiber-optic connectivity** and **broadband** services available.\n- The Marshall Islands have implemented various projects to improve the telecommunications infrastructure, including the installation of new fiber-optic cables and the expansion of the mobile network.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Marshall Islands have implemented various **infrastructure development projects**, including the construction of new roads, the expansion of the airport, and the development of renewable energy sources.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to improve access to **clean water** and **sanitation** facilities, particularly in rural areas, with the help of international organizations and donor countries.\n- The country has received significant funding from **international organizations**, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to support its infrastructure development goals.\n- The Marshall Islands have also established partnerships with **private sector companies** to develop and implement infrastructure projects, particularly in the areas of energy and telecommunications.\n- The government has set a goal to complete all the ongoing infrastructure development projects by 2025, with the aim of improving the overall infrastructure development level of the country.",
