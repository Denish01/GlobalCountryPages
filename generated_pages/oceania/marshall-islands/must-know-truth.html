        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The Marshall Islands are a chain of islands located in the Pacific Ocean, and their history dates back to around 2000 BCE when the first Micronesian settlers arrived. The islands were later influenced by various cultures, including the Spanish, Germans, and Japanese. In 1529, the Spanish explorer Álvaro de Saavedra became the first European to visit the islands. The Marshall Islands were later colonized by Germany in 1885, and during this period, the Germans established a number of trading posts and missions.</p>
        <p>In 1914, during World War I, the Marshall Islands were occupied by Japan, and after the war, they were mandated to Japan by the League of Nations. The Japanese established a number of military bases and fortifications on the islands, which were later used during World War II. In 1944, the United States captured the Marshall Islands from Japan, and after the war, the islands were placed under the trusteeship of the United States by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The Marshall Islands gained independence from the United States in 1986, when they signed the Compact of Free Association, which provided for the islands' defense and economic development in exchange for the use of the islands for military purposes. The Compact of Free Association also provided for the establishment of a trust fund to support the islands' economic development. Today, the Marshall Islands are a sovereign nation, with a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> system of government.</p>
        <p>The Marshall Islands have a unique cultural identity that reflects their history and geography. The islands have a rich tradition of storytelling, music, and dance, and the <strong>Marshallese language</strong> is an important part of the islands' cultural heritage. The islands are also home to a number of important historical sites, including the <strong>Kwajalein Atoll</strong>, which was the site of a major battle during World War II.</p>
