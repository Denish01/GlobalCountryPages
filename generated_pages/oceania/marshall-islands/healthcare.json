The public healthcare system is **free** for citizens, but it is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of essential medical supplies and equipment. Private healthcare providers are available, but they are mostly limited to the capital city of Majuro and are often expensive. The quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with **rural** areas having limited access to medical facilities and specialized care.\n\nIn terms of quality of care, the Marshall Islands' healthcare system is **basic**, with limited capabilities for advanced medical procedures and specialized care. Patients often have to travel to other countries, such as the United States or Australia, for more complex medical treatments. This can be a significant challenge for patients who do not have the financial resources or access to travel.\n\nThe Marshall Islands government has been working to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new medical equipment and training for healthcare professionals. However, the system still faces significant challenges, and patients are often advised to have **private health insurance** to cover the cost of medical care, especially if they need to travel to other countries for treatment.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Majuro Hospital | Majuro | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Ebeye Hospital | Ebeye | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Private Medical Clinic | Majuro | Private | General medicine, dental care | Yes |\n| Marshall Islands Medical Center | Majuro | Private | General medicine, surgery, specialized care | Yes |\n| Kwajalein Hospital | Kwajalein | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Ailinglaplap Clinic | Ailinglaplap | Public | General medicine, primary care | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all visitors and expats to cover the cost of medical care, especially if they need to travel to other countries for treatment.\n- The Marshall Islands has a limited number of local insurance providers, but they often do not provide comprehensive coverage.\n- **Expats** are often required to have private health insurance as a condition of their employment or residency.\n- The cost of health insurance in the Marshall Islands can be high, especially for comprehensive coverage.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors to cover the cost of medical evacuations and other emergency medical expenses.\n- Some employers in the Marshall Islands may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are often in short supply in the Marshall Islands, and patients may have to rely on imported medications from other countries.\n- **Prescriptions** are required for most medications, and patients may need to see a doctor to get a prescription.\n- **Common brands** of medications are often available, but patients may have to pay out of pocket for them.\n- **Pharmacy access** is limited, especially in rural areas, and patients may have to travel to Majuro or other urban areas to access a pharmacy.\n- **Costs** of medications can be high, especially for imported medications, and patients may need to have private health insurance to cover the cost.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to the Marshall Islands.\n- **Typhoid** and **rabies** vaccinations may also be recommended, depending on the individual's activities and travel plans.\n- The Marshall Islands is at risk for **dengue fever**, **zika virus**, and other **mosquito-borne illnesses**, and visitors should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in the Marshall Islands, and visitors should avoid drinking untreated water or eating uncooked foods that may have been washed in untreated water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and visitors should avoid eating undercooked or raw foods, especially meat and seafood.\n- **Sun protection** is also important, as the sun's rays can be strong in the Marshall Islands.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- The Marshall Islands is not a popular destination for **medical tourism**, due to its limited medical infrastructure and capabilities.\n- However, some patients may travel to the Marshall Islands for **dental care** or other **specialized treatments** that are not available in their home country.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in the Marshall Islands may offer some medical tourism services, but these are limited.\n- **Cost savings** may be a factor for some medical tourists, but patients should carefully consider the risks and limitations of seeking medical care in the Marshall Islands.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a **medical emergency**, patients should call the emergency number (625-4444) or seek immediate attention at a hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is limited, and patients may need to rely on private transportation to get to a hospital or clinic.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be located in Majuro or other urban areas, and patients may need to travel to access medical care.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed as soon as possible, and patients should keep all medical records and receipts to support their claim.\n- Patients should also be aware of the **emergency procedures** in place at their hotel or resort, and know how to access medical care in the event of an emergency.",
