  "content": "The primary languages spoken in Marshall Islands are **Marshallese** and **English**, with Marshallese being the official language and widely used in everyday life, while English is commonly used in business, education, and government.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Marshallese, English\nWidely Spoken: None\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Austronesian\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Marshall Islands is dominated by the Marshallese language, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. Marshallese is an Austronesian language, which is a language family that spans a wide range of languages spoken in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. There are several regional dialects of Marshallese, including the Ratak and Ralik dialects, which are spoken in different parts of the country. English is also widely spoken, particularly in the capital city of Majuro, and is commonly used in business, education, and government. Many Marshallese people are bilingual, speaking both Marshallese and English, which has become an important language for communication with the outside world.\n\nThe use of English in Marshall Islands is a legacy of the country's history as a trust territory of the United States, which administered the islands from 1947 to 1986. As a result, English is widely used in education, business, and government, and is an important language for communication with the outside world. However, Marshallese remains the dominant language in everyday life, and is an important part of Marshallese culture and identity. Despite the widespread use of English, there are still some areas of the country where English is not widely spoken, and visitors may need to use a phrasebook or interpreter to communicate with locals.\n\nMarshallese is a complex language with its own unique grammar and syntax, and is not easily learned by outsiders. However, many visitors to the country are able to pick up basic phrases and words, which can be helpful in communicating with locals and showing respect for the culture. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Marshall Islands is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern languages, with Marshallese and English being the two most widely spoken languages.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Iakwe | YAK-way | formal |\n| Hello | Kio | KEY-oh | informal |\n| Thank you | Kommol | KOM-mol |  |\n| Please | Jab | JAHB |  |\n| Yes / No | Aeo / Jaab | AY-oh / JAHB |  |\n| Excuse me | Bwitik | BWEE-tee-k |  |\n| How much? | Etke kwoj | ET-keh KWOH-j |  |\n| Where is...? | Ewi iien | AY-ee EE-en |  |\n| I don't understand | Ij jeban | EE-j JEH-bahn |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Ej jab kajin majel | AY JAHB KAH-jin MAH-jel |  |\n| Help! | Bok | BOH-k |  |\n| Goodbye | Iakwe | YAK-way | formal |\n| Sorry | Bwitik | BWEE-tee-k |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Juon | JOON |\n| 2 | Ruon | ROON |\n| 3 | Truk | TROOK |\n| 4 | Emem | EH-mem |\n| 5 | Lim | LEEM |\n| 6 | Jilu | JEE-loo |\n| 7 | Jit | JEET |\n| 8 | Ralitok | RAH-lee-toh-k |\n| 9 | Ratimjuon | RAH-tee-moo-YOHN |\n| 10 | Jon | YOHN |\n| 100 | Raan | RAH-n |\n| 1000 | Ruwatan | ROO-wah-tahn |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when communicating with older Marshallese people.\n- Use formal language when speaking to people you don't know, and avoid using slang or colloquialisms.\n- Avoid physical contact or touching, as this can be considered impolite in Marshallese culture.\n- Use gestures and body language to show respect, such as bowing your head or using a gentle handshake.\n- Be patient and take the time to listen to what the other person is saying, as communication can be slow and deliberate in Marshallese culture.\n- Avoid interrupting or finishing someone's sentence for them, as this can be seen as impolite.\n- Use a calm and gentle tone of voice, and avoid raising your voice or speaking loudly.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a Marshallese language app, such as iTranslate or Google Translate, to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and words.\n- Use a language learning website or online course to learn more about the Marshallese language and culture.\n- Hire a local guide or interpreter to help with communication and navigation.\n- Practice speaking Marshallese with locals, and be patient with yourself as you learn the language.",
