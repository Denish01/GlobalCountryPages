# Marshall Islands Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands' culture is a unique blend of Micronesian and Western influences, shaped by its history of colonialism, missionary work, and geographic isolation. The indigenous Marshallese people have a strong tradition of storytelling, navigation, and fishing, which has been passed down through generations. The country's cultural identity is also defined by its matrilineal society, where women play a significant role in decision-making and property ownership. The Marshallese language is the primary language spoken, but English is widely used as a second language, particularly in education and government.

The Marshall Islands' cultural landscape has been influenced by various external factors, including Japanese, German, and American colonial rule. These influences have introduced new customs, traditions, and practices, which have been incorporated into the local culture. For example, Christianity was introduced by European missionaries, and today, the majority of the population identifies as Christian. The country's cultural diversity is also reflected in its ethnic makeup, with a small but significant population of expatriates and foreigners living and working in the islands.

The Marshallese people place a strong emphasis on community and family ties, with extended families often living together in traditional thatched-roof houses. Respect for elders and tradition is deeply ingrained in the culture, and visitors are expected to show deference to local customs and practices. The country's cultural heritage is also reflected in its rich tradition of handicrafts, including woodcarving, weaving, and shell jewelry.
