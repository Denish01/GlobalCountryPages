[SECTION] How Marshall Islands Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands is a sovereign nation divided into 24 municipalities, which are further grouped into two chains of islands: the Ratak Chain and the Ralik Chain. The Ratak Chain, which means "sunrise" in Marshallese, includes the atolls of Mejit, Ailuk, Ujae, Likiep, Wotje, Jaluit, and Maloelap. The Ralik Chain, which means "sunset", includes the atolls of Enewetak, Ujelang, Bikini, Rongelap, Ailinglaplap, Kwajalein, Lib, Namu, and Ebeye. Each municipality has its own local government, but the national government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and education.

The division of the Marshall Islands into municipalities and chains of islands reflects the country's geography and history. The atolls are scattered over a vast area of ocean, and each one has its own unique character and culture. The Ratak and Ralik Chains are not only geographical divisions, but also cultural and linguistic ones. The people of the Ratak Chain tend to be more traditional and conservative, while those of the Ralik Chain are more influenced by Western culture.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands have a limited transportation network, with few roads and no railways. The main mode of transportation is by air, with several domestic airports and regular flights between the atolls. There are also several ports and harbors, with ferry services and cargo ships connecting the atolls. The roads on the atolls are generally in poor condition, and driving can be challenging due to the lack of infrastructure and the presence of potholes and other hazards. However, the scenery is often beautiful, with stunning ocean views and picturesque villages. Visitors can also get around by bike or on foot, which is a great way to experience the local culture and meet the people.

The ferry services are a more affordable option, but they can be slow and uncomfortable.

Visitors should also be aware of the limited infrastructure and the potential for delays or cancellations. With patience and planning, however, it is possible to have a safe and enjoyable journey through the Marshall Islands.
