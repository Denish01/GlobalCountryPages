[SECTION] How Expensive Is Marshall Islands? [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands is a sovereign nation located in the Pacific Ocean, and it is considered one of the most expensive countries to visit or live in. The cost of living in the Marshall Islands is high due to its remote location, limited resources, and reliance on imported goods. The country's economy is largely dependent on foreign aid, and this has led to a high cost of living, particularly in the capital city of Majuro. Compared to its neighbors, Kiribati and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands is more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being significantly higher.

The high cost of living in the Marshall Islands is also due to the limited availability of goods and services, which drives up prices. The country has a small population and a limited number of businesses, which means that there is little competition to keep prices low. Additionally, the Marshall Islands is vulnerable to natural disasters, such as typhoons and droughts, which can disrupt the supply chain and drive up prices. Overall, the Marshall Islands is a challenging destination for budget travelers, and visitors should be prepared for high prices and limited amenities.
