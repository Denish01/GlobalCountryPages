  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Marshall Islands can vary significantly, with an average health expenditure per capita of $894, and out-of-pocket spend being relatively low at 1.1% of total health expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $894 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 1.1% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Marshall Islands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and facilities, while private healthcare providers offer higher quality care but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary source of care, while foreigners and those who can afford it may opt for private healthcare. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients paying out-of-pocket for services or using insurance to cover costs. While insurance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical evacuation to other countries may be necessary in case of serious illness or injury.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in the Marshall Islands can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. In the capital city of Majuro, there are several private hospitals and clinics that offer high-quality care, while in more rural areas, healthcare facilities may be limited and of lower quality. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care at private facilities, which may have more English-speaking staff and better equipment. However, even at private facilities, the cost of healthcare can be high, and insurance may be necessary to cover costs.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, surgeries, medical evacuations |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Global coverage, medical evacuations, comprehensive procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers can cost between $5-$20 per prescription\n- Prescription medications may require a doctor's note and can be filled at local pharmacies\n- Pharmacy availability is limited in rural areas, with most pharmacies located in Majuro\n- Over-the-counter medications such as cold and flu medication can be purchased at local stores and pharmacies\n- Medication prices can vary depending on the location and type of pharmacy\n- Some medications may not be available in the Marshall Islands and may need to be imported\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or visit the emergency room at the nearest hospital.
