# Best Time to Visit Marshall Islands — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit the Marshall Islands is during the dry season, from December to May, when the weather is generally calm and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploring the islands.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Marshall Islands: December to May. Peak season: January to March. Budget season: April to May. Avoid: June to November and especially September and October due to the high risk of typhoons and heavy rainfall. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands have a tropical marine climate, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The country experiences two main seasons: a dry season from December to May, and a wet season from June to November. The dry season is the best time to visit, with average temperatures ranging from 84°F to 88°F (29°C to 31°C), and minimal rainfall. The wet season, on the other hand, is marked by frequent rainfall and a higher risk of typhoons, making it less ideal for travel.

The dry season is the peak tourist season, with most visitors arriving between January and March. During this time, the weather is calm and sunny, making it perfect for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and fishing. The wet season, while not ideal for outdoor activities, can be a good time for budget-conscious travelers, as prices for accommodations and tours tend to be lower.

The seasons can significantly affect travel in the Marshall Islands. During the wet season, some islands may be inaccessible due to flooding or rough seas, and outdoor activities may be limited. Additionally, the risk of typhoons is higher during this time, which can impact travel plans and safety. Understanding the seasons and their effects on travel is essential for planning a successful trip to the Marshall Islands.
