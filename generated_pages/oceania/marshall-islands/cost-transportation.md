[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands are a chain of islands, and the primary mode of transportation is by boat or air. The country has a limited road network, and most people get around by walking, cycling, or using taxis. The quality of public transit is relatively poor, with limited bus services available on the main islands of Majuro and Ebeye. However, the government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of a new port and improvements to the airport.

The most common mode of transportation in the Marshall Islands is by boat, with many residents owning their own boats or using ferry services to travel between islands. The country also has a domestic air service, which connects the main islands. Taxis are widely available, but the cost can be high, especially for longer trips. The lack of a well-developed public transportation system makes it difficult for people to get around, especially in rural areas.
