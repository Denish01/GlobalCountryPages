[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The real estate market in Marshall Islands is characterized by limited supply and high demand, particularly in the capital city of Majuro. The market is driven by local demand, with many properties being passed down through generations. The prices of properties in Marshall Islands have been relatively stable over the years, with a slight increase in recent times due to the growing economy and infrastructure development. The urban areas, such as Majuro and Ebeye, tend to have higher property prices compared to rural areas. The market is also influenced by the presence of the United States military, which has a significant base in Kwajalein.

The property market in Marshall Islands is also affected by the country's **climate change** and rising sea levels, which poses a significant threat to the islands' existence. This has led to a decrease in investment in the property market, as many investors are wary of the long-term viability of the islands. Despite these challenges, the government is taking steps to promote the property market, including the development of new infrastructure and the establishment of a **land registry** system.

The market is also driven by the growing **tourism industry**, which has led to an increase in demand for **short-term rentals** and **vacation homes**. This has created opportunities for investors to invest in the property market, particularly in areas with high demand for tourism-related accommodations. However, the market is still relatively small, and investors need to be aware of the unique challenges and risks associated with investing in Marshall Islands.
