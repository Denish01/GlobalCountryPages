[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands' healthcare system is a mixed model that combines public and private providers, but it faces significant challenges due to limited resources and a shortage of medical professionals. The public healthcare system is **free** for citizens, but it is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of essential medical supplies and equipment. Private healthcare providers are available, but they are mostly limited to the capital city of Majuro and are often expensive. The quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with **rural** areas having limited access to medical facilities and specialized care.

In terms of quality of care, the Marshall Islands' healthcare system is **basic**, with limited capabilities for advanced medical procedures and specialized care. Patients often have to travel to other countries, such as the United States or Australia, for more complex medical treatments. This can be a significant challenge for patients who do not have the financial resources or access to travel.

The Marshall Islands government has been working to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new medical equipment and training for healthcare professionals. However, the system still faces significant challenges, and patients are often advised to have **private health insurance** to cover the cost of medical care, especially if they need to travel to other countries for treatment.
