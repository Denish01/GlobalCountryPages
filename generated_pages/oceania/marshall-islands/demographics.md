[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands has a relatively small population, with a total of 42,418 people as of the latest estimates. The population growth rate is approximately 1.7%, which is relatively high compared to other countries. The population is predominantly young, with a median age of 20.3 years. The urban population accounts for around 72.5% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city of Majuro. The population density is approximately 233 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high considering the limited land area of the Marshall Islands. The life expectancy at birth is around 67.8 years, and the fertility rate is approximately 3.5 children per woman.

The population growth trend in the Marshall Islands is influenced by factors such as high birth rates, limited access to healthcare and family planning services, and a relatively young population. Urbanization is also a significant trend, with many people migrating from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities, education, and healthcare. However, this trend also poses challenges, such as overcrowding, inadequate housing, and strain on public services. The government and international organizations are working to address these challenges and promote sustainable development, including investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

The Marshall Islands also experiences migration patterns, with many citizens traveling to other countries for education, work, or other opportunities. The United States is a popular destination, particularly for those seeking higher education or employment. However, this migration can also lead to brain drain and loss of skilled workers, which can have negative impacts on the local economy and development.
