  "content": "The best time to visit the Marshall Islands is during the dry season, from December to May, when the weather is generally calm and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploring the islands.\n\n[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Marshall Islands: December to May. Peak season: January to March. Budget season: April to May. Avoid: June to November and especially September and October due to the high risk of typhoons and heavy rainfall. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Marshall Islands have a tropical marine climate, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The country experiences two main seasons: a dry season from December to May, and a wet season from June to November. The dry season is the best time to visit, with average temperatures ranging from 84°F to 88°F (29°C to 31°C), and minimal rainfall. The wet season, on the other hand, is marked by frequent rainfall and a higher risk of typhoons, making it less ideal for travel.\n\nThe dry season is the peak tourist season, with most visitors arriving between January and March. During this time, the weather is calm and sunny, making it perfect for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and fishing. The wet season, while not ideal for outdoor activities, can be a good time for budget-conscious travelers, as prices for accommodations and tours tend to be lower.\n\nThe seasons can significantly affect travel in the Marshall Islands. During the wet season, some islands may be inaccessible due to flooding or rough seas, and outdoor activities may be limited. Additionally, the risk of typhoons is higher during this time, which can impact travel plans and safety. Understanding the seasons and their effects on travel is essential for planning a successful trip to the Marshall Islands.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Sunny, dry | High | $$$ | Snorkeling, diving, fishing |\n| February | Sunny, dry | High | $$$ | Outdoor activities, festivals |\n| March | Sunny, dry | Med | $$ | Cultural events, exploring islands |\n| April | Warm, dry | Low | $ | Budget travel, relaxation |\n| May | Warm, dry | Low | $ | Nature walks, birdwatching |\n| June | Hot, humid | Low | $ | Avoid due to start of wet season |\n| July | Hot, humid | Low | $ | Avoid due to heavy rainfall |\n| August | Hot, humid | Low | $ | Avoid due to high risk of typhoons |\n| September | Hot, humid | Low | $ | Avoid due to peak typhoon season |\n| October | Hot, humid | Low | $ | Avoid due to heavy rainfall |\n| November | Warm, humid | Low | $ | Avoid due to end of wet season |\n| December | Sunny, dry | Med | $$ | Holiday celebrations, outdoor activities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Marshall Islands Constitution Day | May | Celebrates the adoption of the country's constitution |\n| Fishermen's Day | June | Honors the country's fishing industry and fishermen |\n| Marshall Islands Independence Day | July | Commemorates the country's independence from the United States |\n| Liberation Day | September | Celebrates the country's liberation from Japanese occupation during World War II |\n| Marshallese Language Day | October | Promotes the use and preservation of the Marshallese language |\n| Christmas | December | Celebrates the Christmas holiday with traditional events and festivities |\n| New Year's Eve | December | Rings in the new year with fireworks and celebrations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The atolls of Rongelap and Ailinglaplap experience a slightly different climate, with more frequent rainfall and stronger winds.\n- The island of Ebeye has a more urban climate, with higher temperatures and humidity due to its dense population.\n- The outer atolls, such as Jaluit and Mili, are more prone to typhoons and heavy rainfall during the wet season.\n- The capital island of Majuro has a more moderate climate, with a mix of sunny and rainy days throughout the year.\n- The northern atolls, such as Kwajalein and Likiep, experience a slightly cooler climate, with average temperatures ranging from 82°F to 86°F (28°C to 30°C).\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, to ensure availability and the best prices.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to May, for lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack lightweight, breathable clothing and sunscreen to protect against the sun and heat.\n- Bring a waterproof jacket or umbrella to prepare for sudden rainfall.\n- Avoid traveling during the peak typhoon season, from September to October, to ensure safety.\n- Respect local customs and traditions, especially during festivals and events, by dressing modestly and removing shoes when entering homes or churches.",
