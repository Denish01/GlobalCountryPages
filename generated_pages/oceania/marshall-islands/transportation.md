[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Marshall Islands are accessible by air, with the Amata Kabua International Airport in Majuro being the main entry point. The airport receives direct flights from neighboring countries, including Kiribati and Micronesia, as well as from Honolulu, Hawaii. There are no direct flights from major cities in Asia, Europe, or the Americas, so travelers typically have to connect through Honolulu or other Pacific island hubs. The airport is small, with basic facilities, and passengers should be prepared for limited amenities and services.

Overland entry points do not exist in the Marshall Islands, as the country is an archipelago of islands and atolls. The only way to enter the country is by air or sea, with the airport being the primary entry point for most visitors. For those arriving by sea, there are several ports and harbors, including the Majuro Lagoon, which is a popular anchorage for yachts and private boats. However, there are no regular ferry services connecting the Marshall Islands to other countries, so sea travel is typically limited to private vessels or occasional cargo ships.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic air travel in the Marshall Islands is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between the main atolls. **Air Marshall Islands** is the national carrier, and it operates flights from Majuro to several outer atolls, including Kwajalein, Jaluit, and Ebeye. Flights are often irregular and subject to weather conditions, so travelers should be prepared for delays or cancellations. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, as there are no online booking systems, and tickets are typically purchased at the airport or through local travel agents. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in the Marshall Islands, so train travel is not an option. The country's geography, with its many islands and atolls, makes it difficult to construct and maintain a rail system. As a result, other modes of transportation, such as air travel and sea transport, are more common.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are no intercity bus companies in the Marshall Islands, and public transportation is limited to taxis and private car rentals. On the main atolls, such as Majuro and Ebeye, there are some **private bus services** that operate on a limited schedule, but these are not a reliable or widespread mode of transportation. Travelers are often forced to rely on taxis or private vehicles to get around, which can be expensive and inconvenient.
