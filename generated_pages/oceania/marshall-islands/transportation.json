  "content": "To get around in Marshall Islands, you can use a combination of domestic flights, taxis, and private car rentals, as the country has a limited public transportation system and no rail network. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Amata Kabua International Airport, MAJ\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe Marshall Islands are accessible by air, with the Amata Kabua International Airport in Majuro being the main entry point. The airport receives direct flights from neighboring countries, including Kiribati and Micronesia, as well as from Honolulu, Hawaii. There are no direct flights from major cities in Asia, Europe, or the Americas, so travelers typically have to connect through Honolulu or other Pacific island hubs. The airport is small, with basic facilities, and passengers should be prepared for limited amenities and services.\n\nOverland entry points do not exist in the Marshall Islands, as the country is an archipelago of islands and atolls. The only way to enter the country is by air or sea, with the airport being the primary entry point for most visitors. For those arriving by sea, there are several ports and harbors, including the Majuro Lagoon, which is a popular anchorage for yachts and private boats. However, there are no regular ferry services connecting the Marshall Islands to other countries, so sea travel is typically limited to private vessels or occasional cargo ships.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic air travel in the Marshall Islands is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between the main atolls. **Air Marshall Islands** is the national carrier, and it operates flights from Majuro to several outer atolls, including Kwajalein, Jaluit, and Ebeye. Flights are often irregular and subject to weather conditions, so travelers should be prepared for delays or cancellations. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, as there are no online booking systems, and tickets are typically purchased at the airport or through local travel agents. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300, depending on the route and airline.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in the Marshall Islands, so train travel is not an option. The country's geography, with its many islands and atolls, makes it difficult to construct and maintain a rail system. As a result, other modes of transportation, such as air travel and sea transport, are more common.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThere are no intercity bus companies in the Marshall Islands, and public transportation is limited to taxis and private car rentals. On the main atolls, such as Majuro and Ebeye, there are some **private bus services** that operate on a limited schedule, but these are not a reliable or widespread mode of transportation. Travelers are often forced to rely on taxis or private vehicles to get around, which can be expensive and inconvenient.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Majuro, Ebeye | $1-$2 | Limited schedule and routes |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $5-$10/km | Available, but prices can be high |\n| Ride-Hailing | Majuro | $5-$10 | Local alternatives, such as **Marshall Islands Taxi** |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | not available | - | Not a common mode of transportation |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in the Marshall Islands, you need a valid **driver's license** from your home country or an international driving permit.\n- Road conditions are generally poor, with many roads being unpaved or in disrepair.\n- Fuel costs are high, due to the country's remote location and limited supply.\n- Car rental companies are available in Majuro, but the selection is limited, and prices can be high.\n- Hazards on the road include potholes, livestock, and pedestrians, so drivers should exercise caution when driving.\n- It is recommended to rent a **4x4 vehicle**, as many roads are unpaved and can be challenging to navigate.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be prepared for **flight delays and cancellations**, as domestic air travel can be unreliable.\n- Always **agree on the fare** before getting into a taxi, as prices can be high and may not be metered.\n- **Download local apps**, such as **Marshall Islands Taxi**, to help you get around and find transportation.\n- **Bargain and negotiate** when renting a car or taking a taxi, as prices can be flexible.\n- **Be aware of your surroundings** and keep an eye on your belongings, as petty crime can be a problem in crowded areas.\n- **Respect local customs** and traditions, especially when visiting outer atolls and remote communities.\n- **Bring a **map or GPS device**, as signage can be limited, and it's easy to get lost.\n- **Learn some basic **Marshallese phrases**, such as \"kommol\" (hello) and \"kwoj\" (goodbye), to help you communicate with locals.",
