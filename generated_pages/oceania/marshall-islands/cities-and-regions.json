The Ratak Chain, which means \"sunrise\" in Marshallese, includes the atolls of Mejit, Ailuk, Ujae, Likiep, Wotje, Jaluit, and Maloelap. The Ralik Chain, which means \"sunset\", includes the atolls of Enewetak, Ujelang, Bikini, Rongelap, Ailinglaplap, Kwajalein, Lib, Namu, and Ebeye. Each municipality has its own local government, but the national government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and education.\n\nThe division of the Marshall Islands into municipalities and chains of islands reflects the country's geography and history. The atolls are scattered over a vast area of ocean, and each one has its own unique character and culture.

The main mode of transportation is by air, with several domestic airports and regular flights between the atolls. There are also several ports and harbors, with ferry services and cargo ships connecting the atolls. The roads on the atolls are generally in poor condition, and driving can be challenging due to the lack of infrastructure and the presence of potholes and other hazards. However, the scenery is often beautiful, with stunning ocean views and picturesque villages. Visitors can also get around by bike or on foot, which is a great way to experience the local culture and meet the people.\n\nDomestic flights are the fastest way to get around the Marshall Islands, with regular services between the atolls.

Visitors should also be aware of the limited infrastructure and the potential for delays or cancellations. With patience and planning, however, it is possible to have a safe and enjoyable journey through the Marshall Islands.",
