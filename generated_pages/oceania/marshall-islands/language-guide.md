[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Marshall Islands is dominated by the Marshallese language, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. Marshallese is an Austronesian language, which is a language family that spans a wide range of languages spoken in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. There are several regional dialects of Marshallese, including the Ratak and Ralik dialects, which are spoken in different parts of the country. English is also widely spoken, particularly in the capital city of Majuro, and is commonly used in business, education, and government. Many Marshallese people are bilingual, speaking both Marshallese and English, which has become an important language for communication with the outside world.

The use of English in Marshall Islands is a legacy of the country's history as a trust territory of the United States, which administered the islands from 1947 to 1986. As a result, English is widely used in education, business, and government, and is an important language for communication with the outside world. However, Marshallese remains the dominant language in everyday life, and is an important part of Marshallese culture and identity. Despite the widespread use of English, there are still some areas of the country where English is not widely spoken, and visitors may need to use a phrasebook or interpreter to communicate with locals.

Marshallese is a complex language with its own unique grammar and syntax, and is not easily learned by outsiders. However, many visitors to the country are able to pick up basic phrases and words, which can be helpful in communicating with locals and showing respect for the culture. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Marshall Islands is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern languages, with Marshallese and English being the two most widely spoken languages.
