  "content": "The infrastructure in Palau is relatively underdeveloped, with a focus on improving roads, energy, and water systems, although significant progress has been made in recent years to enhance the overall quality of life and support the growing tourism industry.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 90% of population\nInternet Penetration: 36%\nRoad Network: 61 km, paved and unpaved roads with moderate quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1 international, 2 domestic\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nPalau's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has been investing in various projects to improve the situation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the road network, expanding the energy generation capacity, and improving access to clean water and sanitation. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with the capital city Ngerulmud and the main tourist areas having better access to amenities and services. The government has been working to address this gap through targeted investments and development projects.\n\nThe country's infrastructure has been shaped by its unique geography and history, with a focus on adapting to the challenges posed by its island location and limited resources. Despite these challenges, Palau has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as energy generation, water supply, and telecommunications. However, more work is needed to address the remaining gaps and ensure that all citizens have access to basic services and amenities.\n\nThe government's development strategy has emphasized the importance of sustainable and environmentally-friendly infrastructure development, recognizing the need to balance economic growth with environmental protection and social equity. This approach has guided investments in areas such as renewable energy, sustainable tourism, and conservation of natural resources. As a result, Palau has become a model for sustainable development in the Pacific region, with a strong focus on protecting its unique natural environment and promoting eco-tourism.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 61 km | Moderate | Paved and unpaved roads, some areas prone to flooding |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in Palau |\n| Airports | 1 international, 2 domestic | Good | International airport with regular flights to Asia and Pacific islands |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Main ports in Koror and Malakal, with cargo and passenger services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of power generation in Palau is diesel-powered plants, with a total installed capacity of 24 MW.\n- The reliability of the energy supply has improved in recent years, with reduced outages and improved maintenance of the power grid.\n- Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are being explored and developed, with a target of increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix to 30% by 2025.\n- The government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency, including the use of energy-efficient appliances and lighting.\n- The Palau Public Utilities Corporation (PPUC) is responsible for managing the energy sector and implementing energy development projects.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Tap water is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but there are concerns about water quality in rural areas, where many households rely on wells and rainwater collection.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with over 90% of households having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- Water access is a challenge in some rural areas, particularly during periods of drought or heavy rainfall, when water sources can be contaminated or disrupted.\n- The government has implemented projects to improve water supply and sanitation infrastructure, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sewage systems.\n- The PPUC is also responsible for managing the water sector and ensuring that all citizens have access to safe and reliable water services.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile phone coverage is available throughout the country, with two main operators providing services, including 4G and 3G networks.\n- Fiber-optic broadband is available in some areas, particularly in Koror and Ngerulmud, with plans to expand coverage to other parts of the country.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve telecommunications infrastructure, including the establishment of a national broadband network and the promotion of ICT services.\n- Postal services are available, with the Palau Postal Service providing mail and package delivery services throughout the country.\n- The telecommunications sector is regulated by the Palau National Communications Corporation (PNCC), which oversees the development of the sector and ensures that all citizens have access to reliable and affordable telecommunications services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major infrastructure development project, funded by the Asian Development Bank, to upgrade the road network and improve access to rural areas.\n- A new international airport terminal is being constructed, with funding from the Japanese government, to improve air transport services and support tourism development.\n- The PPUC is implementing a renewable energy project, funded by the European Union, to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n- The government has also launched a water and sanitation project, funded by the World Bank, to improve access to safe and reliable water services throughout the country.\n- A new telecommunications project, funded by the US government, aims to improve broadband coverage and promote ICT services throughout Palau, with a focus on supporting economic development and improving the overall quality of life for citizens.",
