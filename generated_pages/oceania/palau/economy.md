[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Palau's economy is a high-income economy, driven primarily by tourism, fishing, and construction. The country has a relatively small population of around 0.02 million people, with a strong focus on preserving its unique culture and environment. Palau's economic development level is considered to be relatively high, with a GDP per capita of around $14,950. The country's economy has been growing steadily over the years, with a strong focus on sustainable tourism and conservation of its natural resources.

Palau's economy is also heavily reliant on external aid, particularly from the United States, which provides significant financial assistance to the country. The country's location in the Pacific Ocean, with its rich marine resources and unique biodiversity, makes it an attractive destination for tourists and investors alike.
