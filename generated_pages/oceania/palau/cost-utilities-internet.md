[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Palau is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and garbage collection services. However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the summer months. The Palau Public Utilities Corporation (PPUC) is the main provider of utility services, and it aims to provide stable and affordable rates to its customers. Despite this, the costs of utilities can still be a significant burden for some households, especially those with limited income.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Palau is generally good, with a high percentage of households having access to modern amenities such as electricity, piped water, and sanitation facilities. However, there are still some areas where the infrastructure is limited, particularly in the outer islands. The government has been investing in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the electricity grid and the improvement of water supply systems. As a result, the costs of utilities are expected to remain stable, with some fluctuations due to seasonal variations.
