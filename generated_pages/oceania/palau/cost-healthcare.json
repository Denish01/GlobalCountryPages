The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the public system can be crowded and may have limited resources, particularly in rural areas. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer a higher level of care and more amenities, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the primary source of care, while foreigners and expats may prefer to use private facilities. It is recommended that visitors and expats have health insurance that covers them in Palau, as medical evacuation to another country may be necessary for certain types of care.\n\nThe healthcare system in Palau is generally well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system and ensuring that all citizens have access to quality care. However, the system can be limited by a lack of resources and a shortage of specialized medical professionals. In addition, the country's remote location can make it difficult to access certain types of care, particularly specialized or emergency services. As a result, it is essential for visitors and expats to have a plan in place for accessing medical care, including having health insurance and knowing how to contact emergency services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialized procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices similar to those in the US.\n- Certain medications, such as **antibiotics** and **painkillers**, may require a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not carry all types of medications.\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medications with you when traveling to Palau, as they may not be available locally.\n- Some pharmacies may offer **generic** or **brand-name** options, which can affect the cost of medications.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to know how to contact emergency services and where to go for care.
