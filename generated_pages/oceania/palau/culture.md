# Palau Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Palau's culture is a unique blend of traditional and modern influences, shaped by its strategic location in the Pacific Ocean. The country's cultural identity is defined by its indigenous Palauan people, who have a rich history and customs that date back centuries. The Palauan language is the primary language spoken, but English is also widely spoken, particularly in business and tourism. The ethnic makeup of Palau is predominantly Micronesian, with a small minority of Filipino and Chinese communities. The country's cultural diversity is reflected in its traditional dances, music, and art, which are an integral part of Palauan identity.

The key influences on Palauan culture come from its history as a Spanish colony, followed by German and Japanese rule, and finally, its current status as a sovereign nation in free association with the United States. These influences are evident in the country's architecture, cuisine, and customs. For example, the traditional Palauan house, known as a **bai**, is a large, communal building that serves as a gathering place for families and communities. The bai is often decorated with intricate carvings and traditional artwork, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage.

Palau's cultural identity is also closely tied to its natural environment, with a strong emphasis on conservation and sustainability. The country is home to a stunning array of marine life, including coral reefs, sharks, and rays, and the Palauan people have a deep respect for the ocean and its resources. This is reflected in the country's traditional fishing practices and its commitment to protecting its marine environment for future generations.
