[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The housing market in Palau is relatively small and expensive, with limited options available for renters and buyers. The rental market is dominated by short-term leases, typically ranging from six months to a year, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Palauan law, but the process of resolving disputes can be lengthy and bureaucratic. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Micronesia and the Philippines, Palau's housing costs are relatively high, due in part to the country's remote location and limited supply of housing.

The high cost of living in Palau, combined with the limited availability of housing, can make it challenging for expats and locals alike to find affordable accommodation. However, the country's stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly people make it an attractive destination for those willing to pay a premium for the privilege of living in a tropical paradise. The government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of housing and reduce costs, but these efforts are still in their early stages, and the housing market remains competitive.
