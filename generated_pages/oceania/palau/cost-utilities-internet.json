However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the summer months. The Palau Public Utilities Corporation (PPUC) is the main provider of utility services, and it aims to provide stable and affordable rates to its customers. Despite this, the costs of utilities can still be a significant burden for some households, especially those with limited income.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Palau is generally good, with a high percentage of households having access to modern amenities such as electricity, piped water, and sanitation facilities. However, there are still some areas where the infrastructure is limited, particularly in the outer islands. The government has been investing in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the electricity grid and the improvement of water supply systems. As a result, the costs of utilities are expected to remain stable, with some fluctuations due to seasonal variations.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | Not applicable |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$165** | **$210** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 10-20 Mbps | Palau Telecom, PNCC |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 50-100 Mbps | Palau Telecom, PNCC |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-30 | 1-10 GB | Palau Mobile, PNCC |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Palau Mobile, PNCC |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | Palau Telecom, PNCC |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Palau-based streaming services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Palau, it is recommended to contact the PPUC or a private service provider, such as Palau Telecom or PNCC, to arrange for the connection of electricity, water, and other services.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but they may not be the most cost-effective option for households with high energy usage.\n- The best internet providers in Palau are Palau Telecom and PNCC, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take steps such as reducing energy consumption, using energy-efficient appliances, and conserving water.\n- It is also a good idea to compare prices and plans from different service providers to find the best deals and discounts.",
