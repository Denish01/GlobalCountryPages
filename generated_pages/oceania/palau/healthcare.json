  "content": "Healthcare in Palau is a mixed system that provides a relatively high quality of care, with both public and private facilities available, although options are limited due to the country's small size and remote location.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 911\nHospital Standard: Adequate\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Palau is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public system is primarily funded by the government, while private providers cater to those who can afford to pay out of pocket or have private insurance. The quality of care in Palau is generally considered to be good, with many healthcare professionals having received training in the United States or other developed countries. However, the limited size and resources of the country mean that some specialized services may not be available, and patients may need to be evacuated to other countries for complex procedures. Urban areas, such as the capital Ngerulmud, tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be more limited.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system in Palau, and has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality and accessibility of care. These include programs to increase the number of healthcare professionals, improve infrastructure, and enhance disease prevention and control measures. Despite these efforts, challenges remain, including a shortage of specialized healthcare professionals and limited access to certain medications and equipment.\n\nOverall, while the healthcare system in Palau has its limitations, it is generally able to provide a good level of care, particularly for routine and emergency services. However, those with complex or specialized needs may need to seek care outside of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Belau National Hospital | Koror | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Koror State Hospital | Koror | Public | General medicine, pediatrics, emergency care | Yes |\n| Airai State Hospital | Airai | Public | General medicine, minor surgery, outpatient care | Limited |\n| Private Medical Clinic | Koror | Private | General medicine, family practice, minor surgery | Yes |\n| Rock Island Clinic | Koror | Private | General medicine, urgent care, travel medicine | Yes |\n| Palau Community Health Center | Ngerulmud | Public | Community health, preventive care, health education | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all visitors and expats, as it can help cover the cost of medical care and evacuation if necessary\n- Local insurance options are limited, but some companies offer plans that cater to foreigners and expats\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended, as it can provide coverage for unexpected medical and travel-related expenses\n- Expats and long-term residents may be eligible for **group health insurance** plans offered by their employers or through private insurance companies\n- The cost of health insurance in Palau can vary widely, depending on the provider, level of coverage, and individual circumstances\n- It is essential to carefully review and compare insurance options before making a decision, to ensure that you have adequate coverage for your needs\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are available at **public hospitals** and **private pharmacies**, although the selection may be limited\n- Some medications may require a **prescription** from a licensed healthcare provider, while others may be available over the counter\n- Common brands and generics are available, although the range of options may be limited compared to larger countries\n- The cost of medications in Palau can be relatively high, particularly for imported brands\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary medications with you when traveling to Palau, as well as a copy of your prescription and any relevant medical documents\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Palau\n- **Influenza** vaccination is also recommended, particularly during the flu season\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Palau, and travelers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites\n- **Dengue fever** and **zika virus** are also present in the country, and travelers should take measures to prevent mosquito bites\n- Water and food safety are generally good in Palau, but travelers should still take precautions to avoid consuming contaminated food or water\n- It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider before traveling to Palau, to determine the necessary vaccinations and precautions for your individual circumstances\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Palau is not a major destination for **medical tourism**, due to its limited facilities and specialized services\n- However, some private clinics and hospitals may offer specialized services such as **dental care** or **cosmetic surgery**\n- The cost of medical procedures in Palau can be relatively high, particularly for complex or specialized services\n- It is essential to carefully research and evaluate any medical tourism options, to ensure that you receive high-quality care and follow all necessary safety protocols\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a medical emergency, call **911** or contact the nearest hospital or clinic\n- **Ambulance services** are available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- It is recommended to have a **first aid kit** and know basic first aid procedures, in case of emergencies\n- If you need to make an **insurance claim**, contact your insurance provider as soon as possible, and follow their procedures for filing a claim\n- In the event of a serious emergency, evacuation to a neighboring country or the United States may be necessary, and it is essential to have adequate insurance coverage and a plan in place for emergency situations.",
