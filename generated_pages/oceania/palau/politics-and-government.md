Palau's government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a four-year term and is limited to two terms. The **legislative branch** is a bicameral body known as the Palau National Congress, consisting of a 13-seat Senate and a 16-seat House of Delegates. Members of the Senate serve four-year terms, while members of the House of Delegates serve two-year terms. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Land Court, with the Supreme Court being the highest court in the land.

The government of Palau operates under a **unitary system**, where the central government has authority over the entire country. However, Palau is also divided into 16 states, each with its own **state government**. These state governments have a degree of autonomy and are responsible for providing various services to their citizens. The separation of powers between the branches of government is designed to provide checks and balances, ensuring that no one branch has too much power.

Palau's political system is based on the principles of **democracy** and **representative government**. The government is accountable to the people, and citizens have the right to participate in the democratic process through free and fair elections. The government is also committed to protecting the rights of its citizens, including the right to freedom of speech, assembly, and the press.
