# Best Time to Visit Palau — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Palau is from October to May, with the dry season offering ideal weather conditions for outdoor activities and exploration of the country's stunning natural beauty.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Palau: October to May. Peak season: December to April. Budget season: June to September. Avoid: July and August due to the high risk of typhoons and heavy rainfall. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Palau has a tropical climate with two distinct seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from October to May, is characterized by low humidity, gentle breezes, and plenty of sunshine, making it the ideal time to visit the country. During this period, the average temperature ranges from 77°F to 90°F (25°C to 32°C), with minimal rainfall. The wet season, which spans from June to September, is marked by high humidity, frequent rain showers, and a higher risk of typhoons. The wet season is not the best time to visit Palau, as the rain and strong winds can make it difficult to engage in outdoor activities and explore the country's natural attractions.

The dry season is the peak tourist season in Palau, with the majority of visitors arriving between December and April. During this time, the country's popular attractions, such as the Rock Islands and the Jellyfish Lake, can get quite crowded. The prices for accommodations, tours, and activities also tend to be higher during the peak season. In contrast, the wet season is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices. However, the rain and rough seas can limit the availability of certain activities, such as snorkeling and diving.

The seasons in Palau can significantly affect travel plans, as the weather conditions can impact the safety and enjoyment of outdoor activities. For example, the strong winds and rough seas during the wet season can make it difficult to access the Rock Islands, while the calm and clear waters during the dry season make it ideal for snorkeling and diving. Understanding the seasons in Palau is essential for planning a successful and enjoyable trip to the country.
