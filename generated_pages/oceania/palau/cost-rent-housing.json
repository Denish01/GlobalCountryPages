The rental market is dominated by short-term leases, typically ranging from six months to a year, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Palauan law, but the process of resolving disputes can be lengthy and bureaucratic. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Micronesia and the Philippines, Palau's housing costs are relatively high, due in part to the country's remote location and limited supply of housing.\n\nThe high cost of living in Palau, combined with the limited availability of housing, can make it challenging for expats and locals alike to find affordable accommodation. However, the country's stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly people make it an attractive destination for those willing to pay a premium for the privilege of living in a tropical paradise. The government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of housing and reduce costs, but these efforts are still in their early stages, and the housing market remains competitive.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$1,000 | $300-$600 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | Fully furnished, modern appliances |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $600-$1,200 | Family-sized, comfortable living area |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,000-$1,800 | Spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$4,000 | Prime locations, ocean views |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | Residential areas, amenities nearby |\n| Rural | $800-$1,500 | Limited amenities, scenic views |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Koror: $600-$1,200 per month, vibrant downtown area with shops and restaurants\n- Ngerulmud: $400-$800 per month, quiet and peaceful, close to government offices\n- Airai: $300-$600 per month, family-friendly, access to outdoor recreation\n- Meyuns: $800-$1,200 per month, upscale neighborhood, modern amenities\n- Ulimang: $400-$800 per month, traditional village, close to beach and cultural attractions\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Palau [/SECTION]\n- Research thoroughly: Look for apartments and houses through online listings, local real estate agents, and word of mouth to find the best deals.\n- Inspect before signing: Carefully inspect the property for any damage or needed repairs before signing a lease.\n- Negotiate the price: Be prepared to negotiate the rent and other terms of the lease, as landlords may be willing to make concessions.\n- Understand the lease: Carefully review the lease agreement to ensure you understand all the terms and conditions.\n- Consider shared accommodation: Sharing an apartment or house with others can be a more affordable option, especially for short-term stays.\n- Be prepared for power outages: Palau's power grid can be unreliable, so it's essential to have a backup plan, such as a portable generator or flashlights.",
