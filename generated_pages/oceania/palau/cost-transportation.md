[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Palau is a small island nation with limited transportation options. The most common modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and rental cars. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with buses running regularly between the main towns and cities. However, the frequency and coverage of public transportation can be limited, especially in rural areas. Most people get around Palau by driving or taking taxis, as the country has a well-developed road network and a relatively small population.

The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many residents and visitors rely on private vehicles or taxis to get around. However, this can be expensive, especially for longer distances. The government has been working to improve the public transportation system, including the introduction of new bus routes and the upgrading of existing infrastructure. Despite these efforts, transportation costs in Palau can still be relatively high, especially for those who rely on taxis or rental cars.
