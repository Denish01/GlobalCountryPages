[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Palau is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public system is primarily funded by the government, while private providers cater to those who can afford to pay out of pocket or have private insurance. The quality of care in Palau is generally considered to be good, with many healthcare professionals having received training in the United States or other developed countries. However, the limited size and resources of the country mean that some specialized services may not be available, and patients may need to be evacuated to other countries for complex procedures. Urban areas, such as the capital Ngerulmud, tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be more limited.

The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system in Palau, and has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality and accessibility of care. These include programs to increase the number of healthcare professionals, improve infrastructure, and enhance disease prevention and control measures. Despite these efforts, challenges remain, including a shortage of specialized healthcare professionals and limited access to certain medications and equipment.

Overall, while the healthcare system in Palau has its limitations, it is generally able to provide a good level of care, particularly for routine and emergency services. However, those with complex or specialized needs may need to seek care outside of the country.
