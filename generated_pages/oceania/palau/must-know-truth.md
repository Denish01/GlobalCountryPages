# The Truth About Palau - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Palau, officially known as the Republic of Palau, is a sovereign nation located in the Pacific Ocean, part of the larger region of Oceania. The country has a rich and complex history, with various colonial powers vying for control over the islands. The first recorded European visitor to Palau was the Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos in 1543. However, it was not until the late 19th century that Palau became a German colony, known as German New Guinea, from 1899 to 1914.

Following Germany's defeat in World War I, Palau was mandated to Japan by the League of Nations in 1920. During this period, Japan invested heavily in the development of Palau's infrastructure, economy, and culture. The Japanese occupation of Palau lasted until the end of World War II, when the United States took control of the islands in 1944. Palau remained under US administration as part of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until it gained independence on October 1, 1994.

The road to independence was long and complex, with Palauans voting in favor of independence in 1992, but requiring a 75% majority to approve the Compact of Free Association with the United States. This compact, which came into effect in 1994, provides for the United States to be responsible for Palau's defense and foreign affairs, while Palau retains control over its domestic affairs. Today, Palau is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Pacific Community.
