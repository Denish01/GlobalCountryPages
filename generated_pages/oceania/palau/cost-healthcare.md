[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Palau's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the public system can be crowded and may have limited resources, particularly in rural areas. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer a higher level of care and more amenities, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the primary source of care, while foreigners and expats may prefer to use private facilities. It is recommended that visitors and expats have health insurance that covers them in Palau, as medical evacuation to another country may be necessary for certain types of care.

The healthcare system in Palau is generally well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system and ensuring that all citizens have access to quality care. However, the system can be limited by a lack of resources and a shortage of specialized medical professionals. In addition, the country's remote location can make it difficult to access certain types of care, particularly specialized or emergency services. As a result, it is essential for visitors and expats to have a plan in place for accessing medical care, including having health insurance and knowing how to contact emergency services.
