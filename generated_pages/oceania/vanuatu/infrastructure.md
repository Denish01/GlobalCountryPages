# Vanuatu Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Vanuatu is relatively underdeveloped, with challenges in accessing electricity, clean water, and reliable transportation, particularly in rural areas. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 55% of population
Internet Penetration: 24%
Road Network: 1,210 km, moderate quality with paved and unpaved sections
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other Pacific Island nations. Recent investments have been made to improve the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and ports. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on increasing access to these services in rural areas. Despite these efforts, many communities in Vanuatu still rely on traditional methods for energy, water, and transportation.

The infrastructure in Vanuatu is vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and earthquakes, which can cause significant damage to roads, bridges, and buildings. The country is also at risk from climate change, with rising sea levels and increased flooding posing a threat to coastal communities. To address these challenges, the government has been working to develop more resilient infrastructure, including the construction of sea walls and the implementation of early warning systems for natural disasters.

Overall, while Vanuatu's infrastructure faces significant challenges, the government and international partners are working to improve the situation. With continued investment and support, it is possible to develop a more sustainable and resilient infrastructure system that meets the needs of the country's growing population.
