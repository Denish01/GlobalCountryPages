[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, and the quality of services can vary depending on the location. The cost of utilities in Vanuatu can be unstable and fluctuating, with prices increasing over the past few years due to inflation and other economic factors. The inflation rate in Vanuatu was 11.2% in 2023, which has contributed to the rising cost of utilities. Additionally, there may be seasonal variations in utility costs, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season.

The government of Vanuatu has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of electricity and water services to rural areas. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, particularly those with low incomes. The GDP per capita PPP in Vanuatu is $3,606, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. As a result, many households have to rely on alternative sources of energy, such as solar power, to reduce their utility bills.
