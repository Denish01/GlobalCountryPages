[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu's cuisine is a unique fusion of traditional Melanesian, French, and Asian flavors, reflecting the country's history and cultural diversity. The local diet is heavily influenced by the availability of fresh seafood, root vegetables, and tropical fruits. The use of **coconut milk** and **island spices** is prevalent in many dishes, adding a distinct flavor and aroma to the cuisine. Regional variations exist, with the northern islands having a stronger Melanesian influence and the southern islands showing more French and Asian influences.

The traditional Vanuatuan cuisine is centered around **Laplap**, a dish made from grated root vegetables, wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. This dish is often served on special occasions and is a staple at traditional ceremonies. The introduction of European and Asian cuisines has also had a significant impact on the local food culture, with dishes like **Poulet Fish** (a fish dish cooked in coconut milk and spices) and **Kava** (a traditional drink made from the roots of the kava plant) becoming integral parts of the Vanuatuan cuisine.

Vanuatu's food culture is also characterized by its emphasis on community and sharing. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and the traditional **Kastom** (custom) of sharing food is still practiced today. This emphasis on community and sharing is reflected in the many traditional ceremonies and festivals that take place throughout the year, where food plays a central role in bringing people together.
