# Best Time to Visit Vanuatu — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Vanuatu is during the dry season, from May to October, when the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Vanuatu: May to October. Peak season: July to August. Budget season: November to April. Avoid: January to February and March due to the high risk of cyclones and heavy rainfall. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, from May to October, is characterized by low humidity, gentle breezes, and clear skies, making it the best time to visit the islands. The wet season, from November to April, is marked by high temperatures, high humidity, and frequent rainfall, with a higher risk of cyclones. The country's geography, with its mountainous islands and coastal areas, also creates microclimates, resulting in varying weather conditions across different regions. The dry season is the best time for outdoor activities such as diving, snorkeling, and hiking, while the wet season is ideal for surfing and kitesurfing.

The dry season is also the peak tourist season, with schools and universities on summer break, and families and travelers taking advantage of the pleasant weather to explore the islands. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices for accommodations and tour packages. However, some tourist facilities and attractions may be closed or operate on reduced hours during the wet season.

Vanuatu's climate is also influenced by its location in the Pacific Ocean, with the trade winds and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) playing a significant role in shaping the country's weather patterns. The ITCZ, a belt of low-pressure systems near the equator, brings warm, moist air to the region, resulting in high levels of rainfall and humidity during the wet season.
