  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Vanuatu can vary significantly depending on whether you receive treatment at a public or private facility, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $143 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 8.4% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 202\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: VUV\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nVanuatu's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and facilities, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those with the means may choose to seek private care. It is highly recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the costs of medical treatment, as out-of-pocket expenses can be high.\n\nThe healthcare system in Vanuatu is also influenced by the country's geography, with many islands and rural areas being difficult to access. This can make it challenging for people to receive medical attention in a timely manner, particularly in emergency situations. As a result, it is essential for visitors and residents to be aware of the local healthcare options and to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency. The government of Vanuatu has been working to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of new facilities and equipment, but more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the sector.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private clinics may have more specialized services |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public dental services are limited |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Public labs may have limited testing capabilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may have more comfortable facilities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private clinics may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Public hospitals may have limited maternal care services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may have more advanced imaging equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited radiology services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital services, basic medical care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Private hospital services, specialist care, dental and optical care |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, comprehensive medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can be purchased over-the-counter at pharmacies for $5-$10.\n- Prescription medications may require a doctor's note and can cost $10-$50.\n- Pharmacy availability is generally limited to urban areas, with few options in rural areas.\n- Some medications may be in short supply due to the country's remote location.\n- It is recommended to bring any prescription medications with you when traveling to Vanuatu.\n- **Vaccinations** may be required for travel to Vanuatu, and can be obtained at a cost of $50-$100.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to seek help immediately. The emergency number in Vanuatu is 202, and ambulance services are available in urban areas. However, response times may be slow, particularly in rural areas. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally private facilities, such as the **Port Vila Private Hospital**, which offers a range of medical services and has English-speaking staff. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency evacuation, as medical facilities in Vanuatu may not be equipped to handle complex or critical cases. Visitors and residents should research their options and have a **contingency plan** in place in case of a medical emergency.",
