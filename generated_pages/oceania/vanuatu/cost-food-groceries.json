The inflation rate of 11.2% in 2023 has also driven up prices, making it essential for visitors and residents to budget accordingly. Eating out is a popular culture in Vanuatu, particularly in Port Vila, where restaurants and cafes offer a wide range of international and local cuisine. However, home cooking is also a common practice, especially among locals, as it can be more affordable and allow for the use of fresh, locally-sourced ingredients.\n\nThe cost of food in Vanuatu is also influenced by the country's limited agricultural production, which means that many staple items, such as rice, flour, and sugar, are imported from other countries. This can drive up prices and make it challenging for low-income households to access affordable and nutritious food. On the other hand, Vanuatu is rich in fresh seafood, fruits, and vegetables, which can be purchased at local markets or directly from farmers, providing a more affordable and healthy alternative.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2-$3 | 200-300 VUV | imported from Australia or New Zealand |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1-$2 | 100-200 VUV | locally baked or imported |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-$3 | 200-300 VUV | locally produced |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 100-200 VUV | imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6-$8 | 600-800 VUV | imported from Australia or New Zealand |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10-$12 | 1000-1200 VUV | imported from Australia or New Zealand |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-$6 | 500-600 VUV | imported from Australia or New Zealand |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 200-300 VUV | locally produced |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 100-200 VUV | locally produced |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 100-200 VUV | locally produced |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8-$10 | 800-1000 VUV | locally produced |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-$2 | 100-200 VUV | locally bottled |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | traditional dishes like laplap and coconut crab |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | one person, international and local cuisine |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$40 | 3 courses, seafood and steak options |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$80 | upscale, fine dining experience |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | Vanuatu-brewed beer |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | international beer brands |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | coffee shops and cafes |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | international brands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries and fresh produce can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Vanuatu. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, especially for imported goods, but they offer a wider range of products and a more convenient shopping experience. Local markets, on the other hand, provide fresh, locally-sourced produce at lower prices, but the selection may be limited, and the quality can vary. It is recommended to buy fresh fruits and vegetables at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for staples like rice, flour, and canned goods.\n\nBargaining is not a common practice in Vanuatu, especially in supermarkets, but it may be accepted in local markets, particularly for bulk purchases or when buying from individual farmers. It is essential to respect local customs and traditions when shopping at markets, and to always ask the vendor if they are willing to negotiate the price. Additionally, some markets may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs, so it is worth asking about these options.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local markets or food stalls can be a affordable and delicious way to experience Vanuatu's cuisine, with meals starting from $5-$10 USD.\n- Fresh seafood, fruits, and vegetables are abundant and affordable in Vanuatu, making them a great option for healthy and affordable meals.\n- **Laplap**, a traditional Vanuatu dish made from taro or yam, is a cheap and nutritious option, often served with coconut crab or fish.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, especially meat and dairy products, as they can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- Shopping at local markets and supporting local farmers can help to reduce food costs and promote the local economy.\n- **Kava**, a traditional Vanuatu drink, is a cheap and popular alternative to beer or other alcoholic beverages, with a cup costing around $1-$2 USD.",
