[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu's transportation network is relatively underdeveloped, with limited public transportation options available, especially outside of the capital city Port Vila. The main modes of transportation in Vanuatu are buses, taxis, and minivans, with many people relying on private vehicles or walking and cycling as alternative options. The quality of public transit is generally good in Port Vila, with regular bus services and taxis readily available, but it can be less reliable in rural areas.

The majority of people in Vanuatu get around using public transportation, with buses and minivans being the most popular options. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on private vehicles or alternative modes of transport, such as bicycles or boats. The government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new roads and the introduction of more efficient public transportation systems.
