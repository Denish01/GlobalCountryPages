  "content": "The culture of Vanuatu is a unique blend of indigenous Melanesian traditions, French and British colonial influences, and modern Pacific Island identity, shaped by its history, geography, and linguistic diversity. \n\n[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]\nVanuatu's culture is defined by its rich cultural heritage, with over 100 languages spoken across the archipelago, and a strong emphasis on community, respect, and traditional customs. The key influences on Vanuatu's culture come from its Melanesian roots, as well as the legacy of French and British colonial rule, which has left a lasting impact on the country's language, education, and governance. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Vanuatu is diverse, with the majority of the population identifying as Ni-Vanuatu, and smaller communities of Europeans, Asians, and other Pacific Islanders. The official languages of Vanuatu, Bislama, English, and French, reflect the country's complex history and cultural identity.\n\nThe cultural identity of Vanuatu is also shaped by its traditional villages, known as **kastom** villages, where community members live in close-knit groups and adhere to traditional customs and practices. These villages are typically organized around a central meeting place, where community members gather to discuss important issues, resolve disputes, and celebrate special occasions. The **kastom** system is based on a complex network of relationships, obligations, and reciprocity, and is essential to understanding Vanuatu's cultural identity.\n\nIn addition to its traditional villages, Vanuatu's cultural identity is also influenced by its modernization and urbanization. The capital city, Port Vila, is a hub of commercial and cultural activity, with a mix of modern and traditional architecture, and a vibrant arts and cultural scene. The city is home to a number of cultural institutions, including the Vanuatu National Museum, which showcases the country's history, culture, and traditions.\n\n[SECTION] Food & Cuisine [/SECTION]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Must-Try? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Laplap | Main Course | A traditional dish made from taro or yam, fermented in an underground oven | Yes |\n| Tuluk | Main Course | A hearty stew made with fish, vegetables, and coconut milk | Yes |\n| Kava | Beverage | A traditional drink made from the roots of the kava plant, known for its relaxing properties | Yes |\n| Coconut Crab | Seafood | A popular seafood dish made with coconut crab, often served with rice and vegetables | Yes |\n| Poulet Fish | Seafood | A traditional dish made with fish, coconut milk, and spices, often served with rice or laplap | Yes |\n| Vanuatu Beef | Meat | A popular dish made with beef, often served with vegetables and rice | No |\n| Nabangas | Dessert | A traditional dessert made with coconut milk, sugar, and flour, often served with fruit | Yes |\n| Palm Wine | Beverage | A traditional drink made from the sap of palm trees, often served at special occasions | No |\n\nEating customs and food culture play an important role in Vanuatu's culture, with mealtimes often seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds.

In modern times, Vanuatu's cuisine has been influenced by external factors, with the introduction of new ingredients and cooking techniques. However, traditional dishes such as laplap and tuluk remain staples of the Vanuatu diet, and are often served at special occasions and celebrations.\n\n[SECTION] Traditions & Festivals [/SECTION]\n| Festival/Tradition | When | What It Is |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Vanuatu Independence Day | July 30 | A celebration of Vanuatu's independence from France and the United Kingdom |\n| Pacific Arts Festival | Every 4 years | A regional festival showcasing the arts and culture of Pacific Island nations |\n| Ekasup Cultural Village Festival | August | A festival celebrating the culture and traditions of the Ekasup village |\n| Kastom Festival | September | A festival showcasing the traditional customs and practices of Vanuatu's kastom villages |\n| Port Vila Carnival | October | A carnival celebrating the culture and diversity of Port Vila |\n| Christmas | December 25 | A celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ, often marked with church services, feasting, and gift-giving |\n\n[SECTION] Etiquette: Do's and Don'ts [/SECTION]\n**Do:**\n- Respect traditional customs and practices, particularly in rural areas\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Bislama, such as **hello** ( halo ) and **thank you** ( tangkyu )\n- Remove your shoes when entering a traditional village or home\n- Use your right hand when giving or receiving something\n- Respect the **kastom** system and traditional authority\n- Learn about Vanuatu's history and culture before visiting\n\n**Don't:**\n- Touch or point at someone's head, as this is considered rude\n- Use your left hand when giving or receiving something, as this is considered unclean\n- Take pictures of people without their permission, particularly in traditional villages\n- Disrespect traditional customs or practices, particularly in rural areas\n- Litter or dispose of trash inappropriately, as this is considered disrespectful to the environment\n- Ignore or dismiss local advice or guidance, particularly when it comes to safety and security\n\n[SECTION] Arts & Music [/SECTION]\n- **Sand drawing**: a traditional art form that involves creating intricate designs on the sand using a stick or other object\n- **Tamtam drumming**: a traditional form of music that involves playing drums made from hollowed-out logs\n- **String band music**: a popular form of music that involves playing stringed instruments, such as guitars and ukuleles\n- **Kastom dancing**: a traditional form of dance that involves performing intricate movements and steps to traditional music\n- **Storytelling**: an important part of Vanuatu's cultural heritage, with stories often passed down through generations by word of mouth\n\n[SECTION] Useful Phrases [/SECTION]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Halo | HA-lo |\n| Thank you | Tangkyu | TANG-kyoo |\n| Please | Plis | PLEE-s |\n| Yes / No | Yes / No | YES / NO |\n| How much? | Hamas long? | HA-mas LONG |\n| Goodbye | Gud naet | GOOD NAYT |\n| Excuse me | Skuzi | SKOO-zee |\n| Sorry | Sori | SOH-ree |\n| Do you speak English? | Yu save tok English? | YOO SAH-vay TOHK ING-lish |\n| I don't understand | Mi no save | MEE NOH SAH-vay |",
