[SECTION] How Vanuatu Is Divided [/SECTION]
Vanuatu is a sovereign island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, and its administrative structure is divided into six provinces: Malampa, Penama, Sanma, Shefa, Tafea, and Torba. Each province has its own provincial government and is further divided into municipalities and rural areas. The provinces are responsible for delivering various services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, while the national government is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, defense, and economic development.

The division of Vanuatu into provinces is largely based on geographical and cultural factors, with each province having its own unique character and attractions. For example, the province of Sanma is home to the country's second-largest city, Luganville, and is known for its beautiful beaches and coral reefs, while the province of Tafea is the southernmost province and is home to the island of Tanna, which is famous for its active volcano, Mount Yasur.
