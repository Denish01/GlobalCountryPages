[SECTION] How Vanuatu Is Divided [/SECTION]
Vanuatu is an archipelago with a total of six provinces, each comprising several islands. The provinces are Malampa, Penama, Sanma, Shefa, Tafea, and Torba. The country's administrative structure is relatively simple, with the national government based in the capital, Port Vila, and provincial governments responsible for local affairs. The provinces are further divided into municipalities and rural areas, with each having its own council and administrative systems. This structure allows for a degree of autonomy and flexibility, enabling local communities to manage their own affairs and respond to local needs.

The division of Vanuatu into provinces is largely based on geographical and cultural factors, with each province having its own distinct character and identity. For example, the province of Tafea is known for its rugged terrain and traditional villages, while the province of Sanma is home to the country's second-largest town, Luganville. This diversity is reflected in the country's languages, customs, and traditions, making Vanuatu a fascinating and culturally rich destination.
