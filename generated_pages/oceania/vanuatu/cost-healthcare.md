[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and facilities, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those with the means may choose to seek private care. It is highly recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the costs of medical treatment, as out-of-pocket expenses can be high.

The healthcare system in Vanuatu is also influenced by the country's geography, with many islands and rural areas being difficult to access. This can make it challenging for people to receive medical attention in a timely manner, particularly in emergency situations. As a result, it is essential for visitors and residents to be aware of the local healthcare options and to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency. The government of Vanuatu has been working to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of new facilities and equipment, but more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the sector.
