[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare, with the Ministry of Health responsible for delivering services through a network of hospitals, health centers, and dispensaries. The quality of care is generally good in urban areas, such as Port Vila, but can be limited in rural areas due to a shortage of medical professionals and resources. The **public healthcare system** is generally accessible to all citizens, but expatriates and tourists may prefer to use private facilities, which offer a higher standard of care.

The **private healthcare sector** in Vanuatu is relatively small, but it provides a range of services, including specialist care and diagnostic testing. Private hospitals and clinics are generally well-equipped and staffed by qualified medical professionals. However, the cost of private healthcare can be high, and many locals rely on the public system. In recent years, the government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare, including the introduction of a **national health insurance scheme**, which aims to increase access to healthcare for all citizens.

Despite these efforts, Vanuatu's healthcare system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, limited resources, and inadequate infrastructure. The **rural-urban divide** is a significant issue, with many rural areas lacking access to basic healthcare services. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including the deployment of **community health workers** to rural areas and the establishment of **telemedicine services** to improve access to specialist care.
