With a GDP per capita of $3,606, the country has a unique blend of traditional and modern lifestyles, which is reflected in its cost of living. The budget of $800 per month would be sufficient for a basic lifestyle, with some compromises on amenities and luxuries. A mid-range lifestyle, on the other hand, would require around $1,800 per month, which would provide a more comfortable standard of living, with access to better amenities and services. In comparison to neighboring countries, such as Fiji and the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu is generally more expensive, especially when it comes to housing and transportation.\n\nThe cost of living in Vanuatu is also influenced by the country's remote location and limited infrastructure, which can drive up the cost of goods and services. However, the country's natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly people make it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike. With some careful planning and budgeting, it is possible to live a comfortable and enjoyable life in Vanuatu, even on a limited budget. For example, the cost of food and groceries can be reduced by shopping at local markets and cooking at home, rather than relying on restaurants and takeaways.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 200 | 400 | 800 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 150 | 300 | 500 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 50 | 100 | 200 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 100 | 150 | 250 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 50 | 100 | 200 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 100 | 200 | 400 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 50 | 100 | 200 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 100 | 200 | 400 | |\n| **Total** | **800** | **1,800** | **3,500** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle in Vanuatu would require some careful planning and compromises.
