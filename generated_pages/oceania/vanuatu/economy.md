[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu is a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $2,631. The country's economic development is categorized as a mixed economy, with a combination of traditional subsistence farming, modern commercial farming, and a growing services sector. The economy has been steadily growing over the past few years, driven by investments in infrastructure, tourism, and agriculture. However, the country remains vulnerable to external shocks, including natural disasters, global economic downturns, and fluctuations in global commodity prices.

The government of Vanuatu has implemented various policies and strategies to promote economic growth and development, including the development of a national sustainable development plan, which aims to reduce poverty, improve living standards, and promote sustainable economic growth. The plan focuses on key sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and services, and aims to increase investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.

Despite these efforts, Vanuatu still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of economic diversification, limited access to finance, and a high dependence on imports. The country is also highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising sea levels, increased frequency of natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns posing significant risks to the economy and the livelihoods of its people.
