The country has a moderate population growth rate of 2.3%, which is driven by a high total fertility rate of 3.7 children per woman. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 21.5 years, and is expected to continue growing over the next few decades. Urbanization is also on the rise, with about 26.4% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Port Vila. Migration patterns in Vanuatu are primarily internal, with people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of Vanuatu is also characterized by a high level of mobility, with many people moving between islands and between urban and rural areas. This mobility has contributed to the spread of ideas, cultures, and languages, and has helped to shape the country's diverse population. Despite the many challenges facing the country, including a lack of economic opportunities and limited access to education and healthcare, the population of Vanuatu remains resilient and determined to build a better future.\n\nThe government of Vanuatu has implemented various policies and programs aimed at managing population growth, improving healthcare and education, and promoting economic development. These efforts have helped to improve living standards and reduce poverty, but more needs to be done to address the country's demographic challenges. With a population that is expected to continue growing over the next few decades, Vanuatu will need to find ways to balance its population growth with its economic and environmental resources.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ni-Vanuatu | 98.5% | Throughout the country | Indigenous Melanesian people |\n| Europeans | 1.1% | Primarily in Port Vila | Mainly of French and British descent |\n| Asians | 0.3% | Primarily in Port Vila | Mainly of Chinese and Vietnamese descent |\n| Pacific Islanders | 0.1% | Throughout the country | From other Pacific Island countries |\n| Other | 0.1% | Throughout the country | Including Africans and Americans |\n[/TABLE]\nThe population of Vanuatu is culturally diverse, with over 100 languages spoken throughout the country.
