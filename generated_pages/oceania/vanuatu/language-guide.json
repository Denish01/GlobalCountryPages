Bislama, a pidgin language, is the most widely spoken and understood language, and is used as a lingua franca for communication among people from different linguistic backgrounds. English and French are also official languages, and are widely used in formal settings, such as government, education, and tourism. Regional dialects of Bislama and other Melanesian languages are also spoken, and minority languages include Tok Pisin and Fijian. English is widely understood in urban areas, particularly in Port Vila, but proficiency may be limited in rural areas.\n\nThe use of language in Vanuatu is also influenced by the country's history and cultural context. For example, French is more widely spoken in the southern islands, while English is more widely spoken in the northern islands. Additionally, many Ni-Vanuatu people speak multiple languages, including their local language, Bislama, and one or more of the official languages. This linguistic diversity is a key aspect of Vanuatu's cultural identity and is reflected in the country's language policies and education system.\n\nIn terms of language use, Bislama is the dominant language in informal settings, such as markets and villages, while English and French are more commonly used in formal settings, such as government offices and schools. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Vanuatu is complex and diverse, reflecting the country's history, culture, and geography.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Halo | HA-lo | informal |\n| Hello (formal) | Bonjour | bone-JOOR | formal, French |\n| Thank you | Tank yu | TANK YOO | informal |\n| Please | Plis | PLEE-s | informal |\n| Yes / No | Yes / No | YESS / NOH | widely understood |\n| Excuse me | Eskus mi | ESS-kus MEE | informal |\n| How much? | Hamas long? | HA-mas long | informal |\n| Where is...? | Wea i stap? | WAY ee STAP | informal |\n| I don't understand | Mi no save | MEE no SA-veh | informal |\n| Do you speak English? | Yu save tok English? | YOO SA-veh TOHK ING-lis | informal |\n| Help! | Helpim mi! | HELP-im MEE | informal |\n| Goodbye | Gudbae | GOOD-bye | informal |\n| Sorry | Sori | SOH-ree | informal |\n| How are you? | Yu stap wel? | YOO STAP WEL | informal |\n| What's your name? | Nem blong yu i wat? | NEM BLONG YOO ee WAHT | informal |\n| I'm lost | Mi los | MEE LOH-s | informal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Wan | WAHN |\n| 2 | Tu | TOO |\n| 3 | Tri | TREE |\n| 4 | Fo | FOH |\n| 5 | Faiv | FAYV |\n| 6 | Sikis | SEE-kees |\n| 7 | Seven | SEH-ven |\n| 8 | Eit | AY-t |\n| 9 | Nain | NAYN |\n| 10 | Ten | TEHN |\n| 100 | Wan hundred | WAHN HUN-dred |\n| 1000 | Wan thousand | WAHN THOW-zend |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when communicating with locals, using formal language and titles such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\"\n- Use body language and gestures to show respect, such as bowing your head or using a gentle handshake\n- Avoid using slang or colloquial language, as it may be misunderstood or offend locals\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Bislama, such as \"hello\" and \"thank you\", to show respect and appreciation for the local culture\n- Be patient and listen carefully, as English proficiency may be limited in rural areas\n- Use visual aids such as maps or pictures to help communicate, especially when bargaining or asking for directions\n- Avoid touching or pointing, as these gestures can be considered rude or aggressive\n- Show respect for local customs and traditions, such as removing your shoes when entering a church or traditional village\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app such as Google Translate or iTranslate to help with communication\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Bislama, such as \"hello\" and \"thank you\", to show respect and appreciation for the local culture\n- Ask locals for help or guidance, such as hotel staff or tour guides, who may be able to provide translation or interpretation services\n- Take a language course or class to learn more about the local language and culture, such as a Bislama language course or a cultural immersion program.",
