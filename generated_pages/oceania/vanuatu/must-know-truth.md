# The Truth About Vanuatu - History & Real Facts

Most people get wrong the fact that Vanuatu is a culturally and geographically diverse country with a complex history, and instead view it as a small, homogeneous island nation in the Pacific. 

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Vanuatu, an island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, has a rich and complex history that spans over 3,000 years. The first inhabitants of Vanuatu were the **Ni-Vanuatu**, who arrived on the islands around 1300 BC. In 1606, the Portuguese explorer **Pedro Fernandes de Queiros** became the first European to visit Vanuatu, and over the next century, the islands were visited by European explorers, including the British and French. In 1906, Vanuatu became a **condominium**, a unique form of government where both Britain and France shared control over the islands. This condominium government lasted for over 70 years, until Vanuatu gained its independence on July 30, 1980.

The condominium government was established through the **Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides**, which was a treaty signed by Britain and France in 1906. This treaty created a joint administration of the islands, with both countries having equal control over the government, economy, and education system. The condominium government was responsible for the development of Vanuatu's infrastructure, including the construction of roads, bridges, and schools. However, the condominium government also had its challenges, including the difficulty of coordinating policies and decisions between the two countries.

Vanuatu's path to independence was a long and difficult one. In the 1960s and 1970s, the **Vanua'aku Pati**, a nationalist party led by **Walter Lini**, began to advocate for independence. The party's efforts were successful, and on July 30, 1980, Vanuatu gained its independence from Britain and France. Since then, Vanuatu has been a **sovereign** nation, with its own government, economy, and culture.

Today, Vanuatu is a member of the **Commonwealth of Nations** and the **Pacific Islands Forum**, and has diplomatic relations with countries around the world. The country's government is a **parliamentary democracy**, with a prime minister and a unicameral parliament. Vanuatu's economy is primarily based on **agriculture**, with crops such as copra, cocoa, and coffee being major exports. The country also has a growing **tourism** industry, with visitors drawn to its beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and active volcanoes.
