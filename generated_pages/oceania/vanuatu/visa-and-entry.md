# Vanuatu Visa & Entry Requirements

To enter Vanuatu, citizens of most countries do not need a visa for tourism or business stays of up to 30 days, but it's essential to verify the specific requirements for your nationality before traveling.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of over 120 countries to enter visa-free for tourism or business purposes. This visa-free access is usually granted for a maximum stay of 30 days, and visitors must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity, a return or onward ticket, and proof of sufficient funds. The country's visa policy aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel for genuine visitors while maintaining national security and immigration controls.

The visa policy of Vanuatu is designed to be welcoming to tourists and business travelers, with a straightforward and efficient process for obtaining the necessary documentation. The government has implemented an electronic visa system for citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free entry, making it easier for visitors to apply for and obtain the required visa.

**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Vanuatu visa-free for up to 30 days, provided they meet the necessary requirements, such as having a valid passport, return or onward ticket, and proof of sufficient funds. The typical stay for tourists is 7-14 days, and visitors can apply for an extension of their stay if they wish to remain in the country for a longer period. To extend their stay, tourists must apply to the Vanuatu Immigration Department at least 24 hours before their current visa expires.

**Students:** Students who wish to study in Vanuatu must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment in a recognized educational institution, a letter of acceptance, and proof of sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay.
