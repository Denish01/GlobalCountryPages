[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Vanuatu is relatively small, with a limited supply of high-quality apartments and houses, particularly in the city center of Port Vila. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to have a written lease agreement to avoid disputes. Compared to regional neighbors like Fiji and New Caledonia, Vanuatu's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a lower cost of living but still offering a range of amenities and services.

The housing market in Vanuatu is driven by a mix of local and expat demand, with a growing number of foreigners moving to the country for work or retirement. The government has implemented policies to encourage affordable housing, but the supply of affordable housing remains limited, particularly in the city center. As a result, renters may need to be flexible with their expectations and budget, considering factors like location, size, and quality of the accommodation.
