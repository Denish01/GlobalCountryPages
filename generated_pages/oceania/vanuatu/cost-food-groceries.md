[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Vanuatu are generally higher than in other Pacific Island countries, due to the country's remote location and reliance on imported goods. The inflation rate of 11.2% in 2023 has also driven up prices, making it essential for visitors and residents to budget accordingly. Eating out is a popular culture in Vanuatu, particularly in Port Vila, where restaurants and cafes offer a wide range of international and local cuisine. However, home cooking is also a common practice, especially among locals, as it can be more affordable and allow for the use of fresh, locally-sourced ingredients.

The cost of food in Vanuatu is also influenced by the country's limited agricultural production, which means that many staple items, such as rice, flour, and sugar, are imported from other countries. This can drive up prices and make it challenging for low-income households to access affordable and nutritious food. On the other hand, Vanuatu is rich in fresh seafood, fruits, and vegetables, which can be purchased at local markets or directly from farmers, providing a more affordable and healthy alternative.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries and fresh produce can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Vanuatu. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, especially for imported goods, but they offer a wider range of products and a more convenient shopping experience. Local markets, on the other hand, provide fresh, locally-sourced produce at lower prices, but the selection may be limited, and the quality can vary. It is recommended to buy fresh fruits and vegetables at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for staples like rice, flour, and canned goods.

Bargaining is not a common practice in Vanuatu, especially in supermarkets, but it may be accepted in local markets, particularly for bulk purchases or when buying from individual farmers. It is essential to respect local customs and traditions when shopping at markets, and to always ask the vendor if they are willing to negotiate the price. Additionally, some markets may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs, so it is worth asking about these options.
