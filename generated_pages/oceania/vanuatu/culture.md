# Vanuatu Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

The culture of Vanuatu is a unique blend of indigenous Melanesian traditions, French and British colonial influences, and modern Pacific Island identity, shaped by its history, geography, and linguistic diversity. 

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Vanuatu's culture is defined by its rich cultural heritage, with over 100 languages spoken across the archipelago, and a strong emphasis on community, respect, and traditional customs. The key influences on Vanuatu's culture come from its Melanesian roots, as well as the legacy of French and British colonial rule, which has left a lasting impact on the country's language, education, and governance. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Vanuatu is diverse, with the majority of the population identifying as Ni-Vanuatu, and smaller communities of Europeans, Asians, and other Pacific Islanders. The official languages of Vanuatu, Bislama, English, and French, reflect the country's complex history and cultural identity.

The cultural identity of Vanuatu is also shaped by its traditional villages, known as **kastom** villages, where community members live in close-knit groups and adhere to traditional customs and practices. These villages are typically organized around a central meeting place, where community members gather to discuss important issues, resolve disputes, and celebrate special occasions. The **kastom** system is based on a complex network of relationships, obligations, and reciprocity, and is essential to understanding Vanuatu's cultural identity.

In addition to its traditional villages, Vanuatu's cultural identity is also influenced by its modernization and urbanization. The capital city, Port Vila, is a hub of commercial and cultural activity, with a mix of modern and traditional architecture, and a vibrant arts and cultural scene. The city is home to a number of cultural institutions, including the Vanuatu National Museum, which showcases the country's history, culture, and traditions.

In modern times, Vanuatu's cuisine has been influenced by external factors, with the introduction of new ingredients and cooking techniques. However, traditional dishes such as laplap and tuluk remain staples of the Vanuatu diet, and are often served at special occasions and celebrations.
