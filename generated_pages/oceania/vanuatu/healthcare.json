  "content": "Healthcare in Vanuatu is a mixed system that provides basic to good quality care, with some limitations, especially in rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nVanuatu's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare, with the Ministry of Health responsible for delivering services through a network of hospitals, health centers, and dispensaries. The quality of care is generally good in urban areas, such as Port Vila, but can be limited in rural areas due to a shortage of medical professionals and resources. The **public healthcare system** is generally accessible to all citizens, but expatriates and tourists may prefer to use private facilities, which offer a higher standard of care.\n\nThe **private healthcare sector** in Vanuatu is relatively small, but it provides a range of services, including specialist care and diagnostic testing. Private hospitals and clinics are generally well-equipped and staffed by qualified medical professionals. However, the cost of private healthcare can be high, and many locals rely on the public system. In recent years, the government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare, including the introduction of a **national health insurance scheme**, which aims to increase access to healthcare for all citizens.\n\nDespite these efforts, Vanuatu's healthcare system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, limited resources, and inadequate infrastructure. The **rural-urban divide** is a significant issue, with many rural areas lacking access to basic healthcare services. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including the deployment of **community health workers** to rural areas and the establishment of **telemedicine services** to improve access to specialist care.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vila Central Hospital | Port Vila | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Port Vila Private Hospital | Port Vila | Private | Specialist care, diagnostic testing | Yes |\n| Northern Provincial Hospital | Luganville | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Lenakel Hospital | Tanna Island | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Vanuatu Medical Care | Port Vila | Private | General practice, specialist care | Yes |\n| Tanna Medical Centre | Tanna Island | Private | General practice, specialist care | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for expatriates and tourists, as it provides access to higher-quality care and can help cover the cost of medical evacuations.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including the national health insurance scheme, which provides basic coverage for citizens.\n- **International health insurance** is also available, and many providers offer policies that cover medical expenses in Vanuatu.\n- The cost of health insurance in Vanuatu can vary depending on the provider and the level of coverage, but **premiums** are generally lower than in other Pacific Island nations.\n- **Expatriates** should research local insurance options and consider purchasing international health insurance to ensure they have adequate coverage.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacies** are available in urban areas, such as Port Vila, and offer a range of medications, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many pharmacies require a doctor's prescription for prescription medications.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including international brands and local generics.\n- **Costs** of medications can vary depending on the type and brand, but many pharmacies offer competitive pricing.\n- **Availability of medications** can be limited in rural areas, and patients may need to travel to urban areas to access certain medications.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Vanuatu.\n- **Hepatitis B** and **rabies** vaccinations are recommended for travelers who will be working with animals or in healthcare settings.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Vanuatu, and travelers should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Dengue fever** and **zika virus** are also present in Vanuatu, and travelers should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Vanuatu, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water and avoid eating undercooked seafood.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat and seafood.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Vanuatu, but some private hospitals and clinics offer specialist care and diagnostic testing.\n- **Popular procedures** include dental care, cosmetic surgery, and orthopedic surgery.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Port Vila Private Hospital and the Vanuatu Medical Care.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, especially for dental care and cosmetic surgery, but travelers should research the quality of care and the qualifications of medical professionals before seeking treatment.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency services** are available in urban areas, including ambulance services and emergency departments.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can be limited in rural areas, and patients may need to rely on private transportation or air medical evacuations.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be far away, especially in rural areas, and patients may need to travel long distances to access medical care.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, and patients should research their insurance coverage and understand the claims process before seeking medical care.\n- **Emergency contact numbers** include the emergency number 112 and the police department, which can provide assistance in emergency situations.",
