[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Vanuatu has a **territorial taxation** system, which means that only income earned within the country is subject to tax, regardless of the individual's or company's tax residency status. This system is beneficial for individuals and companies who earn income from foreign sources, as it is not subject to tax in Vanuatu. To be considered a tax resident in Vanuatu, an individual must have been present in the country for at least 6 months in a calendar year. Companies are considered tax residents if they are incorporated in Vanuatu or have their central management and control in the country.

The tax system in Vanuatu is relatively simple, with a limited number of tax rates and exemptions. The country has a **double taxation agreement** with several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, to prevent double taxation of income earned by individuals and companies. Vanuatu also has a **tax information exchange agreement** with several countries, which allows for the exchange of tax information between countries to prevent tax evasion.
