[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Vanuatu is accessible by air and sea, with the main international airport being Bauerfield International Airport in Port Vila, the capital city. Direct flights to Vanuatu are available from major cities in the Pacific region, including Fiji, New Caledonia, and Australia. Air Vanuatu is the national carrier and operates flights to and from the country. There are no overland entry points to Vanuatu, as it is an island nation. The airport is located about 6 kilometers from Port Vila's city center and offers a range of facilities, including duty-free shops, restaurants, and currency exchange.

Travelers can also arrive in Vanuatu by sea, with several cruise lines offering itineraries that include the country. The Port Vila harbor is a popular stop for cruise ships, and there are also several marinas and yacht clubs that cater to private boat owners. Additionally, there are ferry services that connect Vanuatu to neighboring islands, including Fiji and the Solomon Islands. These ferry services are a more affordable option for travelers, but they can take several days to reach their destination.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights are a convenient way to travel between Vanuatu's islands, with Air Vanuatu operating flights to several destinations, including Santo, Tanna, and Malekula. The airline offers multiple daily flights to these destinations, and the journey times are relatively short, ranging from 30 minutes to an hour. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as flights can fill up quickly. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 USD, depending on the route and time of booking. It is also worth noting that some domestic flights may have limited schedules, so it is essential to plan ahead and book flights accordingly.
