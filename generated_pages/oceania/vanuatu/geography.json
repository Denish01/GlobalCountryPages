The islands are bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the north, east, south, and west, and are situated near the countries of Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe strategic location of Vanuatu in the Pacific Ocean has made it an important stopover for travelers and traders throughout history. The country's proximity to Australia and New Zealand has also made it a popular destination for tourists from these countries. The borders of Vanuatu are defined by the exclusive economic zones of the country, which provide a significant source of revenue through fishing and other marine activities. The country's location in the Pacific Ring of Fire also makes it prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe terrain of Vanuatu is characterized by a mix of volcanic islands, coral reefs, and coastal plains. The islands are mountainous, with the highest point being Mount Tabwemasana on the island of Espiritu Santo, which rises to an elevation of 1,879 meters. The mountains are covered in dense rainforests, which provide a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna. The coastal plains are narrow and are often lined with coral reefs, which provide a barrier against the ocean and support a diverse range of marine life.\n\nThe islands of Vanuatu are also home to several active and dormant volcanoes, which have shaped the landscape over thousands of years. The volcanoes have created a diverse range of landforms, including volcanic peaks, lava flows, and volcanic ash deposits. The islands are also home to several rivers, which flow through the mountains and coastal plains, providing a source of freshwater for the population. The terrain of Vanuatu is also characterized by a range of unique landforms, including the **Mele Cascades**, a series of waterfalls on the island of Efate, and the **Millennium Cave**, a large limestone cave on the island of Espiritu Santo.\n\nThe landscape of Vanuatu is also influenced by the climate, with the tropical conditions supporting a wide range of flora and fauna. The islands are home to several types of forests, including tropical rainforests, cloud forests, and mangrove forests. The forests provide a habitat for a wide range of animals, including birds, reptiles, and mammals.
