The local diet is heavily influenced by the availability of fresh seafood, root vegetables, and tropical fruits. The use of **coconut milk** and **island spices** is prevalent in many dishes, adding a distinct flavor and aroma to the cuisine. Regional variations exist, with the northern islands having a stronger Melanesian influence and the southern islands showing more French and Asian influences.\n\nThe traditional Vanuatuan cuisine is centered around **Laplap**, a dish made from grated root vegetables, wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. This dish is often served on special occasions and is a staple at traditional ceremonies. The introduction of European and Asian cuisines has also had a significant impact on the local food culture, with dishes like **Poulet Fish** (a fish dish cooked in coconut milk and spices) and **Kava** (a traditional drink made from the roots of the kava plant) becoming integral parts of the Vanuatuan cuisine.\n\nVanuatu's food culture is also characterized by its emphasis on community and sharing. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and the traditional **Kastom** (custom) of sharing food is still practiced today. This emphasis on community and sharing is reflected in the many traditional ceremonies and festivals that take place throughout the year, where food plays a central role in bringing people together.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Laplap | Traditional | Grated taro or yam wrapped in banana leaves and steamed | Local markets and restaurants |\n| Poulet Fish | Seafood | Fish cooked in coconut milk and spices | Seafood restaurants in Port Vila |\n| Kava | Traditional Drink | Drink made from the roots of the kava plant | Kava bars and traditional ceremonies |\n| Tuluk | Soup | Traditional soup made with fish, shellfish, and vegetables | Local markets and food stalls |\n| Misisi | Dessert | Sweet coconut cream pie | Bakeries and cafes in Port Vila |\n| Natapoa | Snack | Fried doughnuts made with coconut milk and sugar | Street food vendors |\n| Vatu | Traditional | Steamed fish and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves | Local restaurants and markets |\n| Simboro | Traditional | Grilled fish and shellfish with coconut milk and spices | Beachside barbecues |\n| Kumala | Side Dish | Boiled or roasted sweet potato | Local markets and restaurants |\n| Pwili | Side Dish | Steamed or boiled green bananas | Local markets and restaurants |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Natapoa** (fried doughnuts made with coconut milk and sugar): $1-2 USD\n- **Tuluk** (traditional soup made with fish, shellfish, and vegetables): $3-5 USD\n- **Kava** (traditional drink made from the roots of the kava plant): $2-5 USD\n- **Fresh coconut water**: $1-2 USD\n- **Grilled fish and shellfish**: $5-10 USD\n- **Local fruits** (such as mangoes, pineapples, and bananas): $1-3 USD\n- **Vatu** (steamed fish and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves): $5-10 USD\n- **Misisi** (sweet coconut cream pie): $3-5 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Kava** (traditional drink made from the roots of the kava plant)\n- **Fresh coconut water**\n- **Tanna Coffee** (local coffee grown on the island of Tanna)\n- **Vanuatu Lager** (local beer)\n- **Pineapple juice** (freshly squeezed)\n- **Coconut milk** (used in many traditional dishes and drinks)\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with your hands** is common in traditional settings\n- **Respect for elders** is important, with older individuals often served first\n- **Sharing food** is a key part of Vanuatuan culture\n- **Tipping** is not expected but is appreciated for good service\n- **Dress codes** are generally casual, but modest dress is recommended for traditional ceremonies\n- **Reservations** are not always necessary, but are recommended for popular restaurants\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local markets** (such as the Port Vila Market) for fresh produce and traditional dishes\n- **Food stalls** and **street food vendors** for quick and affordable meals\n- **Restaurants** in Port Vila and other towns for a wider range of international and local cuisine\n- **Beachside barbecues** for fresh seafood and traditional dishes\n- **Kava bars** for a traditional drink and social experience\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Port Vila Market** (located in the heart of Port Vila) for fresh produce, traditional dishes, and local handicrafts\n- **Ekasup Village** (located on the island of Efate) for traditional **Kastom** (custom) and a chance to experience local food and culture\n- **Tanna Island** for a coffee tour and a chance to taste local coffee\n- **Mele Cascades** (located on the island of Efate) for a picnic and a chance to swim in the beautiful waterfalls\n- **Vanuatu Cultural Centre** (located in Port Vila) for a chance to learn about local culture and try traditional dishes",
