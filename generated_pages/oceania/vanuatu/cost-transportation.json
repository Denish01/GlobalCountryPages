The main modes of transportation in Vanuatu are buses, taxis, and minivans, with many people relying on private vehicles or walking and cycling as alternative options. The quality of public transit is generally good in Port Vila, with regular bus services and taxis readily available, but it can be less reliable in rural areas.\n\nThe majority of people in Vanuatu get around using public transportation, with buses and minivans being the most popular options. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on private vehicles or alternative modes of transport, such as bicycles or boats. The government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new roads and the introduction of more efficient public transportation systems.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Good coverage in Port Vila |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $1.00-$2.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Widely available in Port Vila |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.00-$2.00 | $1.00-$2.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Togo, Vatu available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10.00-$20.00 | To city center, approximately 10-15 km |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.40 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$20.00 | Limited routes, mainly between Port Vila and Luganville |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, Port Vila to Luganville or Tanna Island |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or minivans instead of taxis or ride-hailing services.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure safety and reliability.\n- Negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, especially for longer trips.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or intercity travel, as it can be more cost-effective than using public transportation or taxis.\n- Download transportation apps, such as Togo or Vatu, to book rides and track your journey in advance.",
