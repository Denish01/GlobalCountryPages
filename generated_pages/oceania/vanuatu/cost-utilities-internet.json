The cost of utilities in Vanuatu can be unstable and fluctuating, with prices increasing over the past few years due to inflation and other economic factors. The inflation rate in Vanuatu was 11.2% in 2023, which has contributed to the rising cost of utilities. Additionally, there may be seasonal variations in utility costs, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season.\n\nThe government of Vanuatu has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of electricity and water services to rural areas. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, particularly those with low incomes. The GDP per capita PPP in Vanuatu is $3,606, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. As a result, many households have to rely on alternative sources of energy, such as solar power, to reduce their utility bills.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane or LPG) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$160** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 10-20 Mbps | TVL, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 50-100 Mbps | TVL, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Digicel, TVL |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-10 GB | Digicel, TVL |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | TVL, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited content) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Vanuatu, it is recommended to contact the provider directly and provide proof of identity and address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and better rates for heavy users.\n- TVL and Digicel are the main internet and phone providers in Vanuatu, but it is worth comparing plans and prices to find the best deal.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- Consider investing in a solar power system to reduce your reliance on the grid and lower your electricity bills.",
