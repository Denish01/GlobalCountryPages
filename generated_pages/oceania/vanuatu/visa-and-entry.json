Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Vanuatu before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nVanuatu has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of over 120 countries to enter visa-free for tourism or business purposes. This visa-free access is usually granted for a maximum stay of 30 days, and visitors must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity, a return or onward ticket, and proof of sufficient funds. The country's visa policy aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel for genuine visitors while maintaining national security and immigration controls.\n\nThe visa policy of Vanuatu is designed to be welcoming to tourists and business travelers, with a straightforward and efficient process for obtaining the necessary documentation. The government has implemented an electronic visa system for citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free entry, making it easier for visitors to apply for and obtain the required visa.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must have return or onward ticket |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must have proof of sufficient funds |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must have valid travel insurance |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must have proof of onward travel |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must have proof of sufficient funds |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance and provide proof of onward travel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Vanuatu visa-free for up to 30 days, provided they meet the necessary requirements, such as having a valid passport, return or onward ticket, and proof of sufficient funds.

Business travelers who are not eligible for visa-free entry must apply for a business visa, which requires an invitation letter from a local company and proof of their business activities.\n**Students:** Students who wish to study in Vanuatu must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment in a recognized educational institution, a letter of acceptance, and proof of sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay. The student visa is usually valid for the duration of the course of study, and students must apply for a new visa if they wish to extend their stay.\n**Workers:** Workers who wish to work in Vanuatu must apply for a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a local employer and proof of their qualifications and experience.
