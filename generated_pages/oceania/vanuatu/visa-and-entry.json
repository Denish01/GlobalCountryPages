[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nVanuatu has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of over 120 countries to enter visa-free for tourism or business purposes. The country aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel, making it an attractive destination for visitors from around the world. Citizens of eligible countries can stay in Vanuatu for up to 30 days without a visa, and in some cases, extensions are possible. However, it's essential to note that visa requirements can change, and travelers should always check with the Vanuatu embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information.\n\nThe visa policy of Vanuatu is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel with the need to maintain national security and immigration control. The country has a range of visa categories, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. Visitors who plan to stay in Vanuatu for an extended period or for purposes other than tourism or business may need to apply for a visa in advance.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 4 months |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 4 months |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 4 months |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 4 months |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 4 months |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists from eligible countries can enter Vanuatu visa-free and stay for up to 30 days.

However, they may need to provide additional documentation, such as a letter of invitation from a Vanuatu-based company or organization. Business travelers who plan to stay in Vanuatu for an extended period or engage in activities that are not considered \"business\" may need to apply for a work visa.\n**Students:** Students who wish to study in Vanuatu must apply for a student visa in advance. They must provide proof of enrollment in a Vanuatu-based educational institution and meet other requirements, such as having sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay. The duration of a student visa is typically 12 months, but can be extended if necessary.\n**Workers:** Workers who wish to work in Vanuatu must apply for a work visa in advance. They must have a job offer from a Vanuatu-based employer and meet other requirements, such as having the necessary qualifications and experience.
