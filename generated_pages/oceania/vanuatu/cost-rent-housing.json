Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to have a written lease agreement to avoid disputes. Compared to regional neighbors like Fiji and New Caledonia, Vanuatu's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a lower cost of living but still offering a range of amenities and services.\n\nThe housing market in Vanuatu is driven by a mix of local and expat demand, with a growing number of foreigners moving to the country for work or retirement. The government has implemented policies to encourage affordable housing, but the supply of affordable housing remains limited, particularly in the city center. As a result, renters may need to be flexible with their expectations and budget, considering factors like location, size, and quality of the accommodation.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$250 | Basic amenities, small size |\n| 1 Bedroom | $350-$600 | $200-$400 | Standard amenities, moderate size |\n| 2 Bedroom | $500-$900 | $300-$600 | Family size, full amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $500-$900 | Spacious, high-end amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$4,000 | Prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,500 | Residential areas, moderate demand |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | Limited amenities, lower demand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Port Vila Town**: $400-$800 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, close to amenities and services, with a vibrant nightlife and cultural scene.\n- **Mele Village**: $300-$600 per month for a 2-bedroom house, a popular expat area with a range of amenities and a relaxed atmosphere.\n- **Erakor Island**: $500-$1,000 per month for a 2-bedroom apartment, a peaceful and scenic area with easy access to the city center.\n- **Seaside**: $250-$500 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, a budget-friendly area with stunning ocean views and a laid-back atmosphere.\n- **Nambatu**: $200-$400 per month for a 1-bedroom house, a local area with a range of amenities and a vibrant community.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Vanuatu [/SECTION]\n- Research online and visit properties in person to get a sense of the local market and prices.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property and navigate the rental process.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, particularly for longer-term rentals.\n- Check the property carefully before signing the lease, and ensure that any repairs or maintenance are documented.\n- Consider renting a furnished property to avoid the cost and hassle of buying furniture and appliances.\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that you are dealing with a legitimate landlord or agent, with a written lease agreement and clear payment terms.",
