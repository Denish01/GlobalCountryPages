[/SECTION]\nAustralia is considered one of the most expensive countries in the world, with a high cost of living that surpasses many of its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region. Compared to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, Australia's prices are significantly higher, while New Zealand is similar in terms of cost. The country's strong economy, high standard of living, and limited geographical size contribute to its expensive nature. Visitors and expats can expect to pay premium prices for accommodation, food, and transportation, especially in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nThe high cost of living in Australia is also driven by the country's remote location, which increases the cost of importing goods and services. Additionally, the country's strong labor market and high minimum wage contribute to higher prices for food, transportation, and other services. However, the high cost of living is also reflected in the country's high standard of living, with excellent education and healthcare systems, and a wide range of cultural and recreational activities.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $20-40 | Basic dorm rooms and shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $100-200 | 3-4 star hotels with private rooms and amenities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $250-500 | 5-star hotels and resorts with high-end amenities |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $1,500-3,000 | City center: $2,000-3,500, outside city center: $1,000-2,000 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-15 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-70 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $2-4 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-5 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-300 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 1,000 | 1,500 | 2,500 |\n| Food | 500 | 800 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 150 | 200 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 300 | 500 |\n| **Total** | **2,000** | **3,050** | **4,700** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in shared accommodation or hostels to reduce rent costs\n- Cook your own meals instead of eating out to save on food expenses\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce transport costs\n- Take advantage of free cultural events and activities, such as museum visits and outdoor concerts\n- Look for discounts and promotions on domestic flights and tourist attractions\n- Buy groceries and other essentials in bulk to reduce costs\n\n[SECTION] Additional Tips [/SECTION]\nIt's also worth noting that Australia has a high tax system, with a goods and services tax (GST) of 10% added to most purchases.
