[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Australia is situated in the southern hemisphere, surrounded by the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is located southeast of Asia, with the Timor Sea to the northwest, the Arafura Sea to the north, and the Coral Sea to the northeast. The country shares maritime borders with several countries, including Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand. The mainland is separated from the island of Tasmania by the Bass Strait. Australia's unique location has resulted in a diverse range of flora and fauna, with many species found nowhere else in the world.

The country's borders are defined by its coastline, which stretches for over 25,000 kilometers. The northern coast is characterized by a tropical climate, with coral reefs and rainforests, while the southern coast is generally cooler and more temperate. The western coast is marked by a vast desert, the Great Victoria Desert, which covers much of the continent. The eastern coast is home to the **Great Dividing Range**, a mountain range that stretches from Queensland to Victoria. This range has played a significant role in shaping Australia's climate, geography, and ecosystems.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Australia's terrain is incredibly diverse, with a range of landscapes that reflect its complex geological history. The country can be broadly divided into several regions, each with its unique characteristics. The **Great Dividing Range** runs along the eastern coast, forming a series of mountains, valleys, and plateaus. This range is home to some of Australia's most beautiful national parks, including the **Blue Mountains** and the **Great Otway National Park**. The range has been shaped by millions of years of erosion, resulting in a scenic landscape of rugged mountains, deep valleys, and picturesque villages.

The central region of Australia is dominated by the **Outback**, a vast and arid desert that covers much of the continent. The Outback is characterized by red sand, spinifex grass, and rocky outcrops, with few trees or other vegetation. This region is home to several famous landmarks, including **Uluru** (also known as Ayers Rock) and the **MacDonnell Ranges**. The Outback is also home to a range of unique and adapted flora and fauna, including the **kangaroo** and the **dingo**. The Outback has a rich cultural heritage, with many **Indigenous Australian** communities calling this region home.

The western region of Australia is marked by a series of coastal plains and **karst** landscapes, with numerous caves, sinkholes, and underground rivers. The **Pinnacles Desert** in Western Australia is a notable example of this type of landscape, with thousands of limestone pillars rising out of the sand. The southern region of Australia is generally cooler and more temperate, with a mix of **forests**, **grasslands**, and **wetlands**. The **Murray River** and the **Darling River** are two of the country's most important waterways, flowing through the heart of the continent and supporting a range of agricultural and urban communities.
