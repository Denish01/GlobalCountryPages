[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Australia has a mixed healthcare system, which combines elements of both public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system, known as **Medicare**, provides free or low-cost healthcare to all Australian citizens and permanent residents. Medicare covers a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. However, the public system can have long waiting times for non-emergency procedures, and the quality of care can vary depending on the location. On the other hand, the private healthcare system offers high-quality care with shorter waiting times, but it can be expensive. Foreigners and visitors to Australia are not covered by Medicare and are recommended to have private health insurance to cover their medical expenses.

The Australian healthcare system works differently for locals and foreigners. Locals can access public healthcare services with their Medicare card, while foreigners need to have private health insurance or pay out-of-pocket for medical services. The cost of healthcare in Australia can be high, especially for foreigners, which is why it is recommended to have private health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses. Private health insurance can provide access to a wider range of services, including private hospitals and specialist care, and can also reduce the cost of medical services.
