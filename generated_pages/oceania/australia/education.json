Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 11, focuses on developing basic skills in reading, writing, and mathematics. Secondary education, which is compulsory for students between the ages of 12 and 17, builds on the foundation established in primary school and prepares students for higher education or the workforce. Tertiary education, which includes universities and vocational education and training (VET) institutions, provides students with advanced skills and knowledge in a specific field. The quality of education in Australia is generally high, with a strong emphasis on academic excellence, research, and innovation. Both public and private schools are available, with public schools being free and private schools requiring tuition fees.\n\nThe public education system in Australia is well-funded and provides students with access to high-quality facilities and resources. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more personalized and specialized education, often with smaller class sizes and a wider range of extracurricular activities. The Australian education system is also known for its **vocational education and training (VET)** programs, which provide students with practical skills and training in a specific industry or occupation.\n\nThe Australian education system is overseen by the federal government, with each state and territory responsible for the administration and delivery of education services within their jurisdiction. This has led to some variation in the education systems between states and territories, but overall, the quality of education in Australia is consistently high.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
