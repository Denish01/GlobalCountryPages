The public healthcare system, known as **Medicare**, provides free or low-cost healthcare to all Australian citizens and permanent residents. Medicare covers a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. However, the public system can have long waiting times for non-emergency procedures, and the quality of care can vary depending on the location. On the other hand, the private healthcare system offers high-quality care with shorter waiting times, but it can be expensive. Foreigners and visitors to Australia are not covered by Medicare and are recommended to have private health insurance to cover their medical expenses.\n\nThe Australian healthcare system works differently for locals and foreigners. Locals can access public healthcare services with their Medicare card, while foreigners need to have private health insurance or pay out-of-pocket for medical services. The cost of healthcare in Australia can be high, especially for foreigners, which is why it is recommended to have private health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses. Private health insurance can provide access to a wider range of services, including private hospitals and specialist care, and can also reduce the cost of medical services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$30 | $50-$100 | Bulk-billed by Medicare for public patients |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $150-$300 | Referral from GP required |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$250 | Not covered by Medicare |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | Not covered by Medicare |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Covered by Medicare for public patients |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $500-$1,000 | Covered by Medicare for public patients |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Covered by Medicare for public patients |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Covered by Medicare for public patients |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Covered by Medicare for public patients |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Covered by Medicare for public patients |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | Covered by Medicare for public patients |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public hospital care, doctor visits, and some medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private hospital care, specialist care, and a wide range of medical services |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Comprehensive medical coverage, including repatriation and emergency evacuation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are subsidized by the Australian government, with a maximum cost of $42.50 per prescription for most medications.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available in pharmacies and supermarkets.\n- Pharmacies are readily available in most cities and towns, with many open 24 hours.\n- Prescription rules are strict, and medications can only be dispensed by a licensed pharmacist.\n- Common medications, such as pain relievers and antibiotics, are relatively inexpensive, with prices ranging from $10 to $30.\n- Some medications, such as those for chronic conditions, may require a doctor's prescription and can be more expensive, with prices ranging from $50 to $100 per month.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn a medical emergency, dial 000 to call for an ambulance or visit the emergency department of a public hospital.
