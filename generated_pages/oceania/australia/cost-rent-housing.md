[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Australian rental market is highly competitive, particularly in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, where demand often exceeds supply. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to 4-6 weeks' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected by state and territory laws, which vary across the country. Australia's housing costs are generally higher compared to its regional neighbors, such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, but comparable to New Zealand. The country's strong economy, high standard of living, and limited housing supply contribute to its expensive housing market.

The rental market conditions in Australia are influenced by factors such as proximity to city centers, public transportation, and amenities like schools, shopping, and healthcare. Renters can expect to pay a premium for properties in desirable locations, with prices decreasing as you move further away from city centers. Australia's housing market is also subject to fluctuations in interest rates, government policies, and economic trends, which can impact rent and property prices. With a GDP per capita of $72,111, Australia has a high standard of living, which contributes to its expensive housing market.
