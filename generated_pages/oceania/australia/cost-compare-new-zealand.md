[SECTION] Overview: Australia vs New Zealand [/SECTION]
Australia and New Zealand are both popular destinations for expats, students, and tourists, but they have distinct economic contexts that affect the cost of living. Australia has a stronger economy, driven by its mining and financial sectors, which contributes to its higher cost of living.
