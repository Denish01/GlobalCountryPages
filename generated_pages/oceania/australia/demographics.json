  "content": "The population of Australia is comprised of a diverse group of people, with approximately 27.5 million individuals calling the country home, representing a unique blend of indigenous and immigrant communities.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 27.5 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 1.3%\nMedian Age: 38.5 years\nUrban Population: 86%\nPopulation Density: 3.6 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 82.5 years\nFertility Rate: 1.7 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe population of Australia is significant in the Asia-Pacific region, with the country experiencing steady growth over the past few decades. This growth can be attributed to a combination of natural increase, due to a relatively high fertility rate and life expectancy, as well as net overseas migration, which has been a major driver of population growth. Urbanization is a key trend in Australia, with the majority of the population residing in major cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. The country's urban population is expected to continue growing, with an increasing proportion of the population living in cities and metropolitan areas.\n\nAustralia's population growth has also been influenced by migration patterns, with the country having a long history of immigration. The country's immigration policy has been designed to attract skilled workers and entrepreneurs, with a focus on meeting labor market needs and promoting economic growth. As a result, Australia has become a culturally diverse society, with people from a wide range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.\n\nThe country's population is also aging, with a significant proportion of the population expected to be over the age of 65 in the coming decades. This demographic shift is likely to have significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social services. To address these challenges, the Australian government has implemented policies aimed at promoting aging in place, increasing workforce participation among older Australians, and improving access to healthcare and social services.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| European | 58% | Predominantly in urban areas | Mainly of British, Irish, and Italian descent |\n| Asian | 18% | Concentrated in urban areas, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria | Includes people of Chinese, Indian, and Vietnamese descent |\n| Indigenous Australian | 3.6% | Dispersed throughout the country, with higher concentrations in the Northern Territory and Western Australia | Includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples |\n| Middle Eastern | 4% | Mainly in urban areas, particularly in New South Wales | Includes people of Lebanese, Turkish, and Arabic descent |\n| Pacific Islander | 2% | Concentrated in urban areas, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland | Includes people of Fijian, Tongan, and Samoan descent |\n[/TABLE]\nAustralia is a multicultural society, with a diverse range of ethnic groups represented.
