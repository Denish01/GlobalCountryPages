[SECTION] How Expensive Is Australia? [/SECTION]
Australia is considered one of the most expensive countries in the world, with a high cost of living that surpasses many of its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region. Compared to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, Australia's prices are significantly higher, while New Zealand is similar in terms of cost. The country's strong economy, high standard of living, and limited geographical size contribute to its expensive nature. Visitors and expats can expect to pay premium prices for accommodation, food, and transportation, especially in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne.

The high cost of living in Australia is also driven by the country's remote location, which increases the cost of importing goods and services. Additionally, the country's strong labor market and high minimum wage contribute to higher prices for food, transportation, and other services. However, the high cost of living is also reflected in the country's high standard of living, with excellent education and healthcare systems, and a wide range of cultural and recreational activities.
