[SECTION] Overview: Australia vs Canada [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Australia and Canada can vary significantly, with Australia being one of the most expensive countries in the world. Australia's strong economy, high standard of living, and limited housing supply contribute to its high cost of living. In contrast, Canada offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower housing costs, transportation expenses, and everyday living expenses. On average, Canada is around 15-20% cheaper than Australia, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Australia's economy is driven by the service sector, mining, and agriculture, while Canada's economy is driven by the service sector, manufacturing, and natural resources. The difference in economic drivers contributes to the variation in cost of living between the two countries. For example, Australia's strong mining industry leads to higher wages and a higher cost of living, while Canada's diverse economy provides a more balanced and affordable lifestyle.
