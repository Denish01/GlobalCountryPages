# Australia Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Australia before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Australia has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, electronic visas, and traditional visa requirements. Citizens of over 30 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, are eligible for visa-free access or electronic visas. However, citizens of other countries, such as India and China, require a traditional visa to enter Australia. The Australian government has implemented a range of visa options to cater to different types of visitors, including tourists, business travelers, students, and workers.

Australia's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate international travel and trade with the need to protect national security and immigration interests. The country has a points-based system for skilled migration, which allows applicants to score points based on their qualifications, work experience, and language skills. This system is designed to attract highly skilled workers who can contribute to the Australian economy.

[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]
**Tourists:** Tourists from eligible countries can apply for an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or eVisitor visa, which allows for a stay of up to 90 days. The typical stay for tourists is 14-30 days, and extensions are possible in some cases. To apply for a tourist visa, applicants must provide proof of sufficient funds, a return ticket, and health insurance.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may require a different type of visa, such as a **Business ETA** or a **Temporary Work (Short Stay) visa**. They must provide an invitation letter from an Australian company, proof of their business activities, and other supporting documents. The requirements for business travelers vary depending on the purpose and duration of their stay.
**Students:** International students must apply for a **Student visa**, which requires proof of enrollment in an Australian educational institution, sufficient funds, and health insurance. The duration of the visa is typically the same as the duration of the course.
**Workers:** Workers must apply for a **Temporary Work visa** or a **Skilled Migration visa**, which requires sponsorship from an Australian employer and a skills assessment. The requirements for workers vary depending on the type of visa and the applicant's qualifications and experience.
