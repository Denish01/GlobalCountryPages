Australia and Papua New Guinea are two neighboring countries in the Oceania region with vastly different economic contexts. Australia is a developed country with a high standard of living, while Papua New Guinea is a developing country with a lower standard of living. The cost of living in Australia is generally higher due to its strong economy, high demand for goods and services, and proximity to major trade routes.
