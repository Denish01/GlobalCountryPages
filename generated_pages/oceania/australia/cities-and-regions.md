[SECTION] How Australia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Australia is divided into six states and two territories. The states are New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. The two territories are the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory. Each state and territory has its own government and is responsible for providing various public services to its residents. The states and territories also have a significant degree of autonomy, with the power to make laws and policies on matters such as education, health, and transportation.

The administrative structure of Australia is based on a federal system, with a national government responsible for matters such as defense, foreign policy, and trade. The national government is also responsible for providing funding to the states and territories for various programs and services. The states and territories, in turn, are responsible for delivering these services to their residents. This division of power and responsibility helps to ensure that the needs of different regions and communities are met, while also promoting national unity and cohesion.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Australia has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and highways connecting major cities and regions. The country's large size and remote location of some regions mean that air travel is often the fastest and most convenient way to get around. However, trains and buses are also available, and can be a more scenic and affordable option for shorter journeys. Driving is also a popular way to explore Australia, with many scenic routes and attractions accessible by car. The road network is generally well-maintained, but driving conditions can be challenging in some remote and rural areas, particularly during wet weather or at night.

Domestic flights are frequent and convenient, with major airlines such as Qantas, Virgin Australia, and Jetstar operating services to most major cities and regional centers. Train services are also available, with interstate trains connecting major cities, and regional trains serving smaller towns and communities. Bus services are also widespread, with many private operators offering scheduled services to major cities and regional centers. Overall, getting around Australia is relatively easy, with a range of transportation options available to suit different budgets, preferences, and travel styles. [CALLOUT] It is recommended to plan ahead and book transportation in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.
