Public schools in Australia are generally considered to be of high quality, with well-qualified teachers and modern facilities.

International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).\n\nThe quality of education in Australia is generally considered to be high, with a strong focus on academic achievement, as well as extracurricular activities and personal development.
