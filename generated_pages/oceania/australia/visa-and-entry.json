[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nAustralia has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, electronic visas, and traditional visa requirements. Citizens of over 30 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, are eligible for visa-free access or electronic visas. However, citizens of other countries, such as India and China, require a traditional visa to enter Australia. The Australian government has implemented a range of visa options to cater to different types of visitors, including tourists, business travelers, students, and workers.\n\nAustralia's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate international travel and trade with the need to protect national security and immigration interests. The country has a points-based system for skilled migration, which allows applicants to score points based on their qualifications, work experience, and language skills. This system is designed to attract highly skilled workers who can contribute to the Australian economy.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | eVisa | 90 days | Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) required |\n| UK Citizens | No | eVisa | 90 days | Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) required |\n| EU Citizens | No | eVisa | 90 days | Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) required |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | eVisa | 90 days | Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) required |\n| Australian Citizens | No | - | - | No visa required for Australian citizens |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Traditional Visa | 30 days | Must apply for a paper-based visa at an Australian embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Traditional Visa | 30 days | Must apply for a paper-based visa at an Australian embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists from eligible countries can apply for an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or eVisitor visa, which allows for a stay of up to 90 days.
