[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Australia is significant in the Asia-Pacific region, with the country experiencing steady growth over the past few decades. This growth can be attributed to a combination of natural increase, due to a relatively high fertility rate and life expectancy, as well as net overseas migration, which has been a major driver of population growth. Urbanization is a key trend in Australia, with the majority of the population residing in major cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. The country's urban population is expected to continue growing, with an increasing proportion of the population living in cities and metropolitan areas.

Australia's population growth has also been influenced by migration patterns, with the country having a long history of immigration. The country's immigration policy has been designed to attract skilled workers and entrepreneurs, with a focus on meeting labor market needs and promoting economic growth. As a result, Australia has become a culturally diverse society, with people from a wide range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

The country's population is also aging, with a significant proportion of the population expected to be over the age of 65 in the coming decades. This demographic shift is likely to have significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social services. To address these challenges, the Australian government has implemented policies aimed at promoting aging in place, increasing workforce participation among older Australians, and improving access to healthcare and social services.
