  "content": "Australia is generally more expensive than Canada, with an average cost of living difference of around 15-20% in favor of Canada. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAustralia GDP per Capita (PPP): 51,885\nCanada GDP per Capita (PPP): 49,651\nAustralia Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nCanada Inflation Rate: 2.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Canada\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Australia vs Canada [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Australia and Canada can vary significantly, with Australia being one of the most expensive countries in the world. Australia's strong economy, high standard of living, and limited housing supply contribute to its high cost of living. In contrast, Canada offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower housing costs, transportation expenses, and everyday living expenses. On average, Canada is around 15-20% cheaper than Australia, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Australia's economy is driven by the service sector, mining, and agriculture, while Canada's economy is driven by the service sector, manufacturing, and natural resources. The difference in economic drivers contributes to the variation in cost of living between the two countries. For example, Australia's strong mining industry leads to higher wages and a higher cost of living, while Canada's diverse economy provides a more balanced and affordable lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Australia (USD) | Canada (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,800 | 1,400 | 22% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 1,200 | 900 | 25% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 3,000 | 2,200 | 26% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Australia (USD) | Canada (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 18 | 15 | 17% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 800 | 600 | 25% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 8 | 6 | 25% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 5 | 4 | 20% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Australia (USD) | Canada (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 120 | 90 | 25% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2.50 | 2.00 | 20% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.00 | 17% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Australia (USD) | Canada (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 120 | 20% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 60 | 50 | 17% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 50 | 40 | 20% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Australia (USD) | Canada (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 2,500 | 2,000 | 20% |\n| Mid-Range | 4,000 | 3,200 | 20% |\n| Comfortable | 6,000 | 4,800 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Australia is cheaper for:**\n- International student tuition fees, with some universities offering more affordable options\n- Certain types of fresh produce, such as avocados and citrus fruits\n- Outdoor activities, such as surfing and hiking, with many free or low-cost options available\n- **Canada is cheaper for:**\n- Housing, with lower rent and mortgage prices compared to Australia\n- Transportation, with more affordable public transportation options and lower fuel prices\n- Groceries, with lower prices for staple items like meat, dairy, and bread\n- Healthcare, with a more comprehensive public healthcare system and lower out-of-pocket costs\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Canada offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower housing costs, transportation expenses, and everyday living expenses.
