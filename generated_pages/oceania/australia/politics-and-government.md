[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Australian government is divided into three branches: the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial**. The **separation of powers** ensures that each branch has distinct responsibilities and checks on the others, preventing any one branch from abusing its power. The federal system allows for a division of power between the federal government and the six states, as well as two territories, with each level of government having its own distinct areas of responsibility. The **federal** system is designed to provide a balance between national unity and regional autonomy, allowing states and territories to manage their own affairs while also contributing to the overall governance of the country.

The Australian system of government is based on the principles of **representative democracy**, where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The government is accountable to the people through regular elections, and the **rule of law** ensures that all citizens are equal before the law. The **independent judiciary** plays a crucial role in upholding the law and protecting individual rights. The government is also subject to **checks and balances**, with institutions such as the **Australian Broadcasting Corporation** and the **Australian National Audit Office** providing oversight and scrutiny.

The Australian system of government has been in place since the country's federation in 1901, and has undergone several significant changes over the years. The **Constitution Act 1900** established the framework for the federal system, and has been amended several times to reflect changing societal values and needs. The government has also implemented various **reforms** aimed at improving transparency and accountability, such as the **Freedom of Information Act 1982** and the **Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013**.
