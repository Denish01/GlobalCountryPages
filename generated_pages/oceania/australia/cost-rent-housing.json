Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to 4-6 weeks' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected by state and territory laws, which vary across the country. Australia's housing costs are generally higher compared to its regional neighbors, such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, but comparable to New Zealand. The country's strong economy, high standard of living, and limited housing supply contribute to its expensive housing market.\n\nThe rental market conditions in Australia are influenced by factors such as proximity to city centers, public transportation, and amenities like schools, shopping, and healthcare. Renters can expect to pay a premium for properties in desirable locations, with prices decreasing as you move further away from city centers. Australia's housing market is also subject to fluctuations in interest rates, government policies, and economic trends, which can impact rent and property prices. With a GDP per capita of $72,111, Australia has a high standard of living, which contributes to its expensive housing market.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$1,800 | Compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $2,000-$3,000 | $1,500-$2,200 | Standard, furnished or unfurnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | Family size, 1-2 bathrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $3,500-$5,500 | $2,500-$4,000 | Spacious, 2-3 bathrooms, extra amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $10,000-$20,000 | Prime locations, high-rise apartments |\n| Suburbs | $6,000-$12,000 | Residential areas, single-family homes |\n| Rural | $3,000-$6,000 | Agricultural areas, large plots of land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Surry Hills** in Sydney: $2,500-$4,000 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its trendy cafes and restaurants\n- **Carlton** in Melbourne: $2,000-$3,500 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, famous for its Italian cuisine and cultural events\n- **Brisbane CBD** in Brisbane: $1,800-$3,000 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, offers a vibrant nightlife and entertainment options\n- **Perth City** in Perth: $1,500-$2,500 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, features a scenic waterfront and outdoor recreational activities\n- **Manuka** in Canberra: $1,800-$3,000 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a charming suburb with a village-like atmosphere\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Australia [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and local amenities before signing a lease to ensure a good fit for your lifestyle\n- Inspect properties thoroughly to identify any potential issues or needed repairs\n- Negotiate rent and terms with the landlord or property manager, if possible\n- Be aware of scams targeting renters, such as fake listings or phishing schemes\n- Typically, utilities like electricity, water, and gas are not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Australia, so be prepared to provide your own furniture and appliances if renting an unfurnished property",
