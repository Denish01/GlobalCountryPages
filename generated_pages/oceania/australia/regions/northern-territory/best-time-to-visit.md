[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Northern Territory has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by dry and cool weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius. This is the best time to visit the region, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and exploring the region's natural wonders. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, making it less ideal for travel.

The dry and wet seasons have a significant impact on travel in the Northern Territory. During the dry season, the roads are accessible, and the weather is perfect for outdoor activities. However, during the wet season, some roads may be closed due to flooding, and the heat and humidity can be oppressive. Additionally, the wet season is also the peak season for mosquitoes and other insects, which can be a nuisance for travelers.

The Northern Territory can be divided into several climate zones, including the tropical north, the desert center, and the subtropical south. Each climate zone has its unique characteristics, and the best time to visit may vary depending on the specific region. For example, the tropical north, which includes Darwin and Kakadu National Park, is best visited during the dry season, while the desert center, which includes Alice Springs and Uluru, can be visited year-round.
