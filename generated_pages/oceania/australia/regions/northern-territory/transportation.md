[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Northern Territory is easily accessible by air, with direct flights to Darwin International Airport from major Australian cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. International flights also connect Darwin to destinations in Asia, such as Singapore and Bali. For those preferring to drive, the Stuart Highway connects the Northern Territory to the rest of Australia, stretching from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south. Alternatively, you can enter the Northern Territory by bus or train, although these options are less frequent and may take longer.

If you're planning to explore the Northern Territory's vast wilderness areas, consider flying into smaller regional airports, such as Alice Springs Airport or Uluru-Kata Tjuta Airport. These airports offer connections to major Australian cities and can be a convenient starting point for your adventure. Overland entry points, such as the Victoria Highway from Western Australia or the Barkly Highway from Queensland, are also available for those who prefer to drive or take the bus. Be sure to check the road conditions and weather forecast before embarking on your journey, especially during the wet season.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The Northern Territory has an extensive domestic air network, with flights connecting major towns and cities. Qantas, Virgin Australia, and Airnorth are some of the main airlines operating in the region. Popular routes include Darwin to Alice Springs, Uluru-Kata Tjuta, and Kakadu National Park. When booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to compare prices across different airlines and book in advance to secure the best deals. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $200 to $500 AUD, depending on the route and time of year. Be sure to check the airline's baggage restrictions and check-in requirements before your flight.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The Northern Territory has a limited rail network, with the famous Ghan train being the main exception. The Ghan runs from Adelaide to Darwin, passing through the MacDonnell Ranges and the Red Center. This iconic train journey offers stunning views of the Australian outback and is a popular tourist attraction. However, the Ghan is not a high-speed train, and the journey takes around 54 hours. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons. The Ghan offers different classes of service, including Red, Gold, and Platinum, with varying levels of comfort and amenities.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Several bus and coach companies operate in the Northern Territory, connecting major towns and cities. Greyhound Australia and McCafferty's Coaches are two of the main operators, offering daily services between Darwin, Alice Springs, and other regional centers. The buses are generally comfortable and well-maintained, although the journeys can be long and tiring. Costs vary depending on the route and operator, but expect to pay around $50 to $100 AUD for a one-way ticket. Be sure to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to secure your seat.
