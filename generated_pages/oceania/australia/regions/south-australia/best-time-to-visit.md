[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
South Australia has a **Mediterranean climate**, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The region can be divided into several climate zones, including the coastal areas, which tend to be cooler and more humid, and the inland areas, which are hotter and drier. The **dry season**, which runs from September to April, is the best time to visit the coastal regions, while the **wet season**, from May to August, is better suited for the inland areas. The seasons can significantly affect travel plans, with the peak tourist season coinciding with the summer months, when schools are on summer break and the weather is warm. However, this also means that popular destinations can be crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist attractions may be higher.

The **shoulder season**, which includes the spring and autumn months, is a great time to visit South Australia, as the weather is mild and pleasant, and the crowds are smaller. This makes it an ideal time for outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking, and wildlife watching. The shoulder season also offers a more relaxed atmosphere, making it easier to explore popular destinations without the crowds. Additionally, many tourist attractions and accommodations offer special deals and discounts during the shoulder season, making it a more budget-friendly option.

The **winter months**, from June to August, are the coolest and wettest time of the year, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. However, this is also the best time to visit the **wine regions**, such as the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale, as the cooler weather makes it perfect for wine tastings and tours. The winter months also offer a unique opportunity to experience the region's **wildlife**, as many animals are more active during this time.
