The public system is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost healthcare to all Australian citizens and eligible residents. The private system, on the other hand, is funded by private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments. The quality of care in South Australia is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, access to healthcare can vary depending on location, with urban areas tend to have more comprehensive services than rural areas. The **Australian public healthcare system**, also known as **Medicare**, provides access to free or low-cost healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe public healthcare system in South Australia is well-organized, with a network of public hospitals and community health centers providing a range of services. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers more specialized services and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost. Overall, the healthcare system in South Australia is designed to provide high-quality, accessible care to all residents and visitors. The **private health insurance** sector is also well-developed, with many providers offering a range of policies to suit different needs and budgets.\n\nIn terms of access to healthcare, urban areas such as Adelaide, the capital city, tend to have more comprehensive services than rural areas. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the use of **telemedicine** and outreach services. These initiatives aim to bridge the gap in healthcare access between urban and rural areas, ensuring that all residents have access to quality medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Royal Adelaide Hospital | Adelaide | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency | Yes |\n| Women's and Children's Hospital | Adelaide | Public | Women's and children's health | Yes |\n| Flinders Medical Centre | Bedford Park | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency | Yes |\n| St Andrew's Hospital | Adelaide | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Calvary Hospital | Adelaide | Private | General medicine, surgery, rehabilitation | Yes |\n| Lyell McEwin Hospital | Elizabeth Vale | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expats, as it provides access to private hospitals and services.\n- **Medicare** is the public healthcare system, which provides free or low-cost healthcare services to Australian citizens and eligible residents.\n- **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)** is required for international students, which provides access to medical and hospital services.\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for visitors, which provides coverage for medical and hospital expenses, as well as other travel-related expenses.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including private health insurance providers such as **Medibank** and **Bupa**.\n- **Expats** may be eligible for Medicare, depending on their visa status and length of stay in Australia.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacies** are widely available in urban and rural areas, with many open 24 hours a day.\n- **Prescription medications** are available at pharmacies, with a prescription from a doctor or other authorized healthcare professional.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including **Panadol** and **Nurofen**.\n- **Costs** of medications vary, but many are subsidized by the government under the **Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)**.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are available at pharmacies and other retail outlets, without a prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** vaccination is recommended for travelers, especially those who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Hepatitis B** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be having medical procedures or engaging in high-risk activities.\n- **Influenza** vaccination is recommended for travelers, especially during the flu season.\n- **Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)** vaccination is recommended for travelers who are not already immune.\n- **Tetanus** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be engaging in outdoor activities, such as hiking or camping.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in South Australia, with safe drinking water available in urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **South Australia** is a popular destination for medical tourism, with many private hospitals and clinics offering specialized services.\n- **Orthopedic surgery** is a popular procedure for medical tourists, with many private hospitals offering high-quality services.\n- **Cosmetic surgery** is also popular, with many private clinics offering a range of procedures.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the **Royal Adelaide Hospital** and **St Andrew's Hospital**, which offer high-quality medical services.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, call **000** for ambulance, fire, or police services.\n- **Ambulance services** are reliable and widely available, with paramedics trained to provide emergency medical care.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by calling **000** or searching online.\n- **Insurance claims** can be made through private health insurance providers or Medicare, depending on the individual's coverage.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, especially for serious injuries or illnesses that require specialized care.",
