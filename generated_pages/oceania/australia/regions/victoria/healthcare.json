Victoria has a high standard of healthcare, with well-equipped hospitals and medical facilities, and a large pool of skilled and qualified healthcare professionals. The quality of care in Victoria is considered to be among the best in the world, with a strong focus on patient-centered care and evidence-based medicine.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Victoria is managed by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees a network of public hospitals, community health services, and other healthcare providers.
