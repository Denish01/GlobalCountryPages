[SECTION] How Queensland Is Divided [/SECTION]
Queensland is divided into six main regions, each with its own unique character and identity. The regions are further divided into local government areas, which are responsible for providing services such as waste management, road maintenance, and public transportation. The six regions are Far North Queensland, North Queensland, Central Queensland, South East Queensland, South West Queensland, and Darling Downs. Each region has its own regional council, which is responsible for promoting economic development, providing community services, and managing natural resources.

The regional councils work together with the state government to provide services and infrastructure to the community. The state government is responsible for providing services such as education, healthcare, and policing, while the regional councils are responsible for providing local services such as waste management and road maintenance. This division of labor allows for a more efficient and effective delivery of services to the community.
