[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Queensland is a vast and diverse region, spanning multiple **climate zones**. The state can be broadly divided into two main climate zones: the tropical north and the subtropical south. The tropical north, which includes cities like Cairns and the Whitsundays, experiences a **wet season** from November to April, with high temperatures and high humidity. The subtropical south, which includes cities like Brisbane and the Gold Coast, has a more moderate climate, with mild winters and warm summers. The **dry season**, from May to October, is generally the best time to visit Queensland, with low humidity and pleasant temperatures.

The seasons in Queensland have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time for outdoor activities like hiking, snorkeling, and surfing. The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, with heavy rainfall and an increased risk of **cyclones**. However, the wet season is also the best time to see Queensland's beautiful **waterfalls** and **wildlife**, as the rain brings new life to the region's flora and fauna.

The **shoulder season**, which falls in the months of April to May and September to November, is a great time to visit Queensland, with mild temperatures and smaller crowds. This time of year is ideal for outdoor activities, as well as visiting popular attractions like the **Great Barrier Reef** and the **Daintree Rainforest**.
