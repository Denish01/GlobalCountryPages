[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Australia has a **self-assessment** tax system, where taxpayers are required to lodge a tax return and pay any tax owing by the due date. The country has a **worldwide taxation** system, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are taxed only on their Australian-sourced income. To be considered a tax resident in Australia, an individual must meet certain **residency rules**, such as being physically present in the country for at least six months, having a permanent home in Australia, or being a member of the Australian defense forces.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is responsible for administering the tax system, including collecting taxes, providing tax refunds, and ensuring compliance with tax laws. The ATO also provides guidance and support to taxpayers through various channels, including online resources, phone services, and face-to-face consultations. Taxpayers can also seek assistance from registered tax agents, who can provide professional advice and help with tax returns.
