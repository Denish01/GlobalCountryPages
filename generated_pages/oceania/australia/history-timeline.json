The British established the first European settlement in Australia in 1788, and over the next century, they expanded their territory, establishing new colonies and displacing Indigenous Australians from their land. The discovery of gold in the mid-19th century led to a significant influx of immigrants, and the population of Australia grew rapidly. In 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia was established, with Edmund Barton as its first prime minister. This marked the beginning of Australia as a federation of six colonies, and the country has since grown and developed into the sovereign nation it is today.\n\nThe key figures in the founding and formation of Australia include **Edmund Barton**, who served as the country's first prime minister, and **Alfred Deakin**, who played a significant role in the development of the Australian constitution. Other important figures include **John McEwen**, who served as prime minister during World War II, and **Gough Whitlam**, who implemented significant social and economic reforms in the 1970s. The country has also been shaped by the experiences and perspectives of Indigenous Australians, who have played a significant role in the development of Australian culture and society.\n\n[SECTION] Colonial & Independence Period [/SECTION]\nThe colonial period in Australia was marked by the displacement of Indigenous Australians from their land, and the establishment of a series of British colonies.

This marked the beginning of Australia as a federation of six colonies, and the country has since grown and developed into the sovereign nation it is today.\n\nThe independence movement in Australia was a gradual process, with the country gaining increasing autonomy from Britain over the course of the 20th century. The **Statute of Westminster** in 1931 granted Australia independence in matters of foreign policy, and the **Australia Act** in 1986 established Australia as a sovereign nation.
