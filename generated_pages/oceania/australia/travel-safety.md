[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Australia is generally a very safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other developed nations. The country has a strong emphasis on community policing and a high level of cooperation between law enforcement agencies, which contributes to its safe environment. However, as with any country, there are areas that are considered safer than others, and tourists should take normal precautions to protect themselves and their belongings.

However, these areas are generally well-known to locals and are easily avoided by tourists. With some basic precautions and an awareness of their surroundings, visitors can have a safe and enjoyable trip to Australia.
