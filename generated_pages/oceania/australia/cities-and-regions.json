The states are New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. The two territories are the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory. Each state and territory has its own government and is responsible for providing various public services to its residents. The states and territories also have a significant degree of autonomy, with the power to make laws and policies on matters such as education, health, and transportation.\n\nThe administrative structure of Australia is based on a federal system, with a national government responsible for matters such as defense, foreign policy, and trade. The national government is also responsible for providing funding to the states and territories for various programs and services. The states and territories, in turn, are responsible for delivering these services to their residents. This division of power and responsibility helps to ensure that the needs of different regions and communities are met, while also promoting national unity and cohesion.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Sydney** (5.3M)\nRole: Economic hub, cultural center, and port city\nKnown For: Sydney is known for its iconic landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, as well as its beautiful beaches and vibrant cultural scene.\nBest For: Visitors interested in culture, entertainment, and outdoor activities.\n\n**Melbourne** (5.1M)\nRole: Cultural center, economic hub, and sports capital\nKnown For: Melbourne is known for its vibrant cultural scene, including its street art, live music, and restaurants, as well as its sports venues and events.\nBest For: Visitors interested in culture, sports, and entertainment.\n\n**Brisbane** (2.6M)\nRole: Economic hub, cultural center, and port city\nKnown For: Brisbane is known for its warm climate, beautiful riverside location, and vibrant cultural scene, including its museums, galleries, and performance venues.\nBest For: Visitors interested in outdoor activities, culture, and family-friendly attractions.\n\n**Perth** (2.0M)\nRole: Economic hub, cultural center, and resource extraction center\nKnown For: Perth is known for its natural beauty, including its beaches, parks, and nearby natural attractions, as well as its vibrant cultural scene and outdoor lifestyle.\nBest For: Visitors interested in outdoor activities, nature, and relaxation.\n\n**Adelaide** (1.4M)\nRole: Cultural center, economic hub, and wine region\nKnown For: Adelaide is known for its vibrant cultural scene, including its festivals, museums, and performance venues, as well as its nearby wine regions and natural attractions.\nBest For: Visitors interested in culture, food, and wine.\n\n**Gold Coast** (0.5M)\nRole: Tourist destination and resort city\nKnown For: The Gold Coast is known for its theme parks, beaches, and vibrant nightlife, as well as its natural beauty, including its hinterland and nearby islands.\nBest For: Visitors interested in theme parks, outdoor activities, and family-friendly attractions.\n\n**Canberra** (0.4M)\nRole: National capital and administrative center\nKnown For: Canberra is known for its national institutions, including its parliament, museums, and galleries, as well as its natural beauty, including its lakes, parks, and nearby mountains.\nBest For: Visitors interested in history, politics, and culture.\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New South Wales | Diverse, urban, and coastal | Sydney, beaches, and wine regions | Sydney |\n| Victoria | Cultural, urban, and coastal | Melbourne, Great Ocean Road, and wine regions | Melbourne |\n| Queensland | Tropical, coastal, and outdoor-focused | Brisbane, Gold Coast, and Great Barrier Reef | Brisbane |\n| South Australia | Wine-focused, cultural, and natural | Adelaide, wine regions, and Outback | Adelaide |\n| Western Australia | Resource-rich, outdoor-focused, and remote | Perth, beaches, and national parks | Perth |\n| Tasmania | Natural, rugged, and wilderness-focused | Hobart, national parks, and wildlife | Hobart |\n| Northern Territory | Remote, Outback, and indigenous-focused | Darwin, Uluru, and Kakadu National Park | Darwin |\n| Australian Capital Territory | National, administrative, and cultural | Canberra, national institutions, and natural beauty | Canberra |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The climate varies significantly across different regions, with tropical climates in the north, temperate climates in the south, and desert climates in the center.\n- The economy also differs across regions, with major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne driving the national economy, while resource extraction and tourism are important in other regions.\n- The culture and lifestyle of different regions are also distinct, with urban and coastal regions tend to be more cosmopolitan and fast-paced, while rural and remote regions are often more laid-back and community-focused.\n- The indigenous culture and history of different regions are also unique, with many regions having their own distinct Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and traditions.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nAustralia has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and highways connecting major cities and regions. The country's large size and remote location of some regions mean that air travel is often the fastest and most convenient way to get around. However, trains and buses are also available, and can be a more scenic and affordable option for shorter journeys. Driving is also a popular way to explore Australia, with many scenic routes and attractions accessible by car. The road network is generally well-maintained, but driving conditions can be challenging in some remote and rural areas, particularly during wet weather or at night.\n\nDomestic flights are frequent and convenient, with major airlines such as Qantas, Virgin Australia, and Jetstar operating services to most major cities and regional centers. Train services are also available, with interstate trains connecting major cities, and regional trains serving smaller towns and communities. Bus services are also widespread, with many private operators offering scheduled services to major cities and regional centers. Overall, getting around Australia is relatively easy, with a range of transportation options available to suit different budgets, preferences, and travel styles. [CALLOUT] It is recommended to plan ahead and book transportation in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.",
