# French Polynesia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

French Polynesia's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on tourism and a relatively high standard of living, but still faces challenges in terms of accessibility and reliability, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 60%
Road Network: 2,590 km, moderate quality with some paved roads
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 5 international, 15 domestic
Major Ports: 3 major
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
French Polynesia's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other Pacific island territories, with significant investments in recent years to improve the quality of roads, ports, and telecommunications. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with Papeete and other major towns enjoying better access to amenities and services. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of new infrastructure projects and the upgrading of existing ones. Despite these efforts, the territory's remote location and limited resources continue to pose challenges to the development of its infrastructure.

The territory's infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on enhancing the tourism sector and promoting economic growth. The government has invested heavily in the development of new hotels, resorts, and other tourism-related infrastructure, which has helped to boost the local economy. However, the lack of connectivity between the islands and the high cost of transportation remain significant challenges. The government is working to address these issues through the development of new air and sea links, as well as the improvement of existing transportation infrastructure.

French Polynesia's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and tsunamis, which can cause significant damage to roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. The government has implemented various measures to mitigate the impact of these events, including the development of emergency response plans and the construction of cyclone-resistant buildings. However, more needs to be done to enhance the resilience of the territory's infrastructure and to protect the local population and economy from the impacts of natural disasters.
