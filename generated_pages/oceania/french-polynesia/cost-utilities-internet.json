However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher prices during the peak tourist season from June to September. The territory's remote location and limited connectivity to the global grid also contribute to higher utility costs. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the island, with Tahiti and Moorea tend to have higher prices than the outer islands.\n\nThe quality of the utility infrastructure in French Polynesia is generally good, with a high level of access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there can be occasional outages and disruptions, particularly during periods of high demand or severe weather events. The government and utility providers are working to improve the infrastructure and reduce the risk of outages, but it is still important for residents and visitors to be aware of the potential for disruptions and plan accordingly.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | rates vary by island |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | includes sewage and trash |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | mostly electric appliances |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in water bill |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-$50 | 10-20 Mbps | Tahiti Nui Telecommunications, Vodafone |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $60-$100 | 50-100 Mbps | Tahiti Nui Telecommunications, Vodafone |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-$20 | 1-5 GB | Vodafone, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$50 | 5-20 GB | Vodafone, Digicel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-$100 | varies | Tahiti Nui Telecommunications, Vodafone |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in French Polynesia |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in French Polynesia |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Tahiti Nui Television, Polynesian streaming services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in French Polynesia, it is recommended to contact the utility providers directly, such as Tahiti Nui Telecommunications for internet and phone services, and Electricité de Tahiti for electricity.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexible payment options and better rates for heavy users.\n- The best internet providers in French Polynesia are Tahiti Nui Telecommunications and Vodafone, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and taking advantage of promotional offers and discounts from utility providers.\n- It is also a good idea to monitor your utility usage regularly and adjust your habits and plans accordingly to avoid unexpected high bills.",
