Typical lease terms are for 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is still essential to carefully review the lease agreement before signing. Compared to regional neighbors, French Polynesia's housing costs are relatively high, but the stunning natural beauty and unique culture of the islands make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists alike. The housing market in French Polynesia is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many properties being used as vacation rentals, which can drive up prices and reduce the availability of long-term rentals.\n\nThe government of French Polynesia has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, but the demand for housing still outstrips the supply, particularly in the lower price ranges. As a result, renters may need to be flexible and willing to consider different types of accommodation, such as shared apartments or houses outside of the city center. Additionally, the cost of living in French Polynesia is relatively high, due to the remote location of the islands and the need to import many goods. This can make it challenging for renters to find affordable accommodation that fits their budget.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $800-1,200 | $500-900 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,000-1,800 | $700-1,400 | modern apartment with kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,500-2,500 | $1,000-2,000 | family-sized apartment with separate bedrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-4,000 | $1,800-3,000 | spacious apartment with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $3,000-5,000 | prime locations, modern apartments |\n| Suburbs | $2,000-3,500 | residential areas, family-sized houses |\n| Rural | $1,000-2,000 | traditional houses, large plots of land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Punaauia: a popular neighborhood for expats, with a range of accommodation options and a vibrant nightlife, rent range $1,000-2,000 per month\n- Faaa: a residential neighborhood with a mix of modern apartments and traditional houses, rent range $800-1,500 per month\n- Pirae: a coastal neighborhood with stunning views of the ocean, rent range $1,200-2,500 per month\n- Mahina: a suburban neighborhood with a range of accommodation options, including houses and apartments, rent range $700-1,200 per month\n- Papeete: the capital city, with a range of accommodation options, including modern apartments and traditional houses, rent range $1,000-2,500 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for French Polynesia [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and prices before starting your search, to get an idea of what to expect\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent, who can help you find the right accommodation and navigate the rental process\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the best properties can rent quickly\n- Consider sharing an apartment or house with others, to reduce costs and make the most of your budget\n- Be aware of any additional costs, such as utilities and internet, which may not be included in the rent\n- Learn some basic French and Tahitian phrases, to help you communicate with your landlord and neighbors",
