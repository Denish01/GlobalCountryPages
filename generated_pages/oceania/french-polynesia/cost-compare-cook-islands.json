However, when it comes to cost of living, there are significant differences between the two. French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France, has a higher cost of living due to its stronger economy and higher standard of living. The GDP per capita in French Polynesia is around 22,000 USD, compared to 18,400 USD in Cook Islands. This translates to higher prices for goods and services, particularly in the capital city of Papeete. On the other hand, Cook Islands, a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand, has a more laid-back and affordable lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of the two territories also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. French Polynesia has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing. This has led to higher wages and a more expensive lifestyle. In contrast, Cook Islands has a smaller economy, with a greater reliance on tourism and foreign aid. As a result, the cost of living in Cook Islands is generally lower, making it an attractive option for expats and travelers on a budget. Overall, Cook Islands is around 20-30% cheaper than French Polynesia, depending on the specific location and lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | French Polynesia (USD) | Cook Islands (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 37% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 300 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | French Polynesia (USD) | Cook Islands (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 350 | 30% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 4 | 20% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | French Polynesia (USD) | Cook Islands (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 20 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.5 | 1.2 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | French Polynesia (USD) | Cook Islands (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | French Polynesia (USD) | Cook Islands (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 900 | 25% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,000 | 1,500 | 25% |\n| Comfortable | 3,500 | 2,500 | 29% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **French Polynesia is cheaper for:**\n  - Luxury goods and high-end dining experiences\n  - Access to high-quality healthcare and education\n  - A wider range of cultural and entertainment options\n  - Better connectivity to international destinations\n- **Cook Islands is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, particularly outside of the capital city\n  - Food and dining, including groceries and restaurant meals\n  - Transportation, including taxis and fuel\n  - Utilities and internet, including mobile plans and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between French Polynesia and Cook Islands, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle and priorities.
