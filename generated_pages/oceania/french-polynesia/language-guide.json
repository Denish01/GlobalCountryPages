There are also regional dialects, such as the **Paumotu** dialect spoken in the Tuamotu archipelago, and minority languages like **Mangarevan**, spoken in the Gambier Islands. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry, but it is still not as widely spoken as French or Tahitian. In tourist areas, such as hotels and restaurants, English is often spoken, but it is less common in rural areas.\n\nThe use of French and Tahitian varies depending on the context, with French being used in formal situations, such as government offices and schools, while Tahitian is used in more informal settings, such as at home and in traditional ceremonies. There is also a growing interest in preserving and promoting the Tahitian language, with efforts to develop language education programs and cultural events that showcase the unique aspects of Tahitian culture. Additionally, many locals speak a mix of French, Tahitian, and other languages, making the linguistic landscape of French Polynesia diverse and complex.\n\nOverall, the language situation in French Polynesia is characterized by a mix of languages, with French and Tahitian being the most widely spoken, and English becoming increasingly popular. Understanding the local language can greatly enhance your experience in French Polynesia, and learning a few basic phrases in French and Tahitian can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Ia ora na | ee-ah oh-rah nah | formal |\n| Hello | Mauruuru | mah-roo-roo | informal |\n| Thank you | Mauruuru roa | mah-roo-roo roh-ah | formal |\n| Thank you | Haere mai | hah-reh my | informal |\n| Please | E haere mai | eh hah-reh my | formal |\n| Please | Faufau | fah-foo | informal |\n| Yes / No | E / Aita | eh / ah-ee-tah | formal |\n| Yes / No | Ae / Aita | ah-eh / ah-ee-tah | informal |\n| Excuse me | E haere mai | eh hah-reh my | formal |\n| Excuse me | Faufau | fah-foo | informal |\n| How much? | E hia te moni? | eh hee-ah teh moh-nee | formal |\n| Where is...? | E aha te...? | eh ah-hah teh... | formal |\n| I don't understand | Ua here ana | oo-ah heh-reh ah-nah | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | E parle inglis? | eh pahrl ayng-lees | formal |\n| Help! | Aua! | ah-oo-ah | formal |\n| Goodbye | Nana | nah-nah | formal |\n| Sorry | Mauruuru | mah-roo-roo | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Tahi | tah-hee |\n| 2 | Piti | pee-tee |\n| 3 | Toru | toh-roo |\n| 4 | Maha | mah-hah |\n| 5 | Pae | pah-eh |\n| 6 | Ono | oh-noh |\n| 7 | Hitu | hee-too |\n| 8 | Va'u | vah-oo |\n| 9 | Iva | ee-vah |\n| 10 | Ho'e | hoh-eh |\n| 100 | Hundra | hoon-drah |\n| 1000 | Tausani | toh-oo-sah-nee |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it's essential to use formal language and titles, such as **Monsieur** or **Madame**, until you are explicitly invited to use first names.\n- Non-verbal communication, such as body language and gestures, can also convey respect and politeness, so be mindful of your posture, facial expressions, and hand movements.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered rude or insulting, such as pointing with your feet or touching someone's head.\n- In formal situations, it's customary to use both hands when giving or receiving something, as using one hand can be seen as impolite.\n- When asking for help or directions, it's a good idea to approach someone who appears to be local and ask politely, using phrases like **E haere mai** or **Faufau**.\n- Be patient and respectful when communicating with locals, as they may not speak English fluently, and try to use visual aids or simple language to convey your message.\n- Learning a few basic phrases in French and Tahitian can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The **Google Translate** app is a useful tool for translating French and Tahitian phrases, and it can also be used offline.\n- **Phrasebooks** and **language guides** can be found at local bookstores or online, and they often include useful phrases and vocabulary for travelers.\n- **Language learning apps**, such as **Duolingo**, can be a great way to learn basic phrases and vocabulary before your trip.\n- **Local tour operators** and **tour guides** often speak English and can provide valuable insights and information about the local culture and language.\n- **Language exchange programs** can be a great way to practice your language skills and learn from locals, and they can often be found through local language schools or community centers.",
