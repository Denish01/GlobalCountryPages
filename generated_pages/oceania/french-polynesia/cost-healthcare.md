[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
French Polynesia has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private healthcare services available. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality and is accessible to locals and those with insurance, while private healthcare services are also available for those who can afford them. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, and most medical services are covered by the government's social security system. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially for private services. The system works well for locals, but foreigners may find it challenging to navigate, especially if they do not speak French or Tahitian.

The quality of public healthcare in French Polynesia is generally good, with well-equipped hospitals and trained medical staff. However, the public healthcare system can be slow, and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, offer faster and more personalized care, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is essential to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially for private services. Many insurance providers offer policies that cover medical expenses in French Polynesia, including emergency medical evacuations to other countries if necessary.
