The healthcare system in French Polynesia is a universal system, providing comprehensive coverage to all residents, including foreigners with a residence permit. The system is managed by the **French Social Security** system, which covers a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. Public healthcare facilities are generally well-equipped and staffed by qualified medical professionals, although some specialized care may require referral to facilities in metropolitan France. In urban areas, such as Papeete, access to healthcare is generally good, with several hospitals and clinics available. However, in rural areas, access to healthcare can be more limited, with fewer facilities and healthcare professionals available.

The quality of care in French Polynesia is generally high, with many medical professionals trained in France or other European countries. However, some specialized care, such as certain types of surgery or cancer treatment, may not be available in French Polynesia, and patients may need to be referred to facilities in metropolitan France. Despite these limitations, the overall quality of care in French Polynesia is considered to be excellent, with a **high life expectancy** and low **infant mortality rate**.

Overall, the healthcare system in French Polynesia is well-organized and provides comprehensive coverage to its residents and visitors.
