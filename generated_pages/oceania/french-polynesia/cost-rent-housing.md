[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in French Polynesia is relatively small, with a high demand for apartments and houses, particularly in the capital city of Papeete. Typical lease terms are for 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is still essential to carefully review the lease agreement before signing. Compared to regional neighbors, French Polynesia's housing costs are relatively high, but the stunning natural beauty and unique culture of the islands make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists alike. The housing market in French Polynesia is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many properties being used as vacation rentals, which can drive up prices and reduce the availability of long-term rentals.

The government of French Polynesia has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, but the demand for housing still outstrips the supply, particularly in the lower price ranges. As a result, renters may need to be flexible and willing to consider different types of accommodation, such as shared apartments or houses outside of the city center. Additionally, the cost of living in French Polynesia is relatively high, due to the remote location of the islands and the need to import many goods. This can make it challenging for renters to find affordable accommodation that fits their budget.
