French Polynesia and Cook Islands are two island territories in the Pacific Ocean, known for their stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. However, when it comes to cost of living, there are significant differences between the two. French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France, has a higher cost of living due to its stronger economy and higher standard of living. The GDP per capita in French Polynesia is around 22,000 USD, compared to 18,400 USD in Cook Islands. This translates to higher prices for goods and services, particularly in the capital city of Papeete. On the other hand, Cook Islands, a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand, has a more laid-back and affordable lifestyle.

The economic context of the two territories also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living.
