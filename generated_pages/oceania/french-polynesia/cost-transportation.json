The quality of public transit varies between islands, with the most developed system found in Tahiti, where city buses and minivans provide coverage of the main areas. However, most people in French Polynesia get around by using taxis, renting cars, or taking domestic flights between islands.\n\nThe lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in French Polynesia can make it challenging for visitors to navigate, especially outside of Tahiti. Nevertheless, the scenic beauty of the islands and the warm hospitality of the locals make it an attractive destination for travelers. With some planning and research, visitors can find affordable and convenient transportation options to explore the islands and enjoy the unique culture of French Polynesia.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2-$3 | $50 | Limited coverage, mainly in Tahiti |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in Tahiti |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $10 | $2-$3 | $20-$30 | |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5-$10 | $1-$2 | $15-$25 | Moov, Tahiti Taxi |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $30-$50 | To city center, Papeete |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-$100 | Economy car, manual transmission |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mainly in Tahiti |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mainly in Tahiti |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$300 | Typical route, e.g., Tahiti to Bora Bora |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider renting a car or scooter for a day to explore the islands, as taxis and ride-hailing services can be expensive.\n- Use the Moov or Tahiti Taxi ride-hailing apps to book taxis or shared rides, as they often offer more affordable rates than traditional taxis.\n- Be sure to negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting your journey, especially for longer trips or airport transfers.\n- Always wear a helmet when riding a scooter or motorcycle, as road safety can be a concern in French Polynesia.\n- Consider purchasing a **Carnet de circulation**, a monthly public transportation pass, for unlimited bus rides in Tahiti.\n- When driving, be aware of the local traffic rules and **speed limits**, as they may differ from those in your home country.",
