  "content": "French Polynesia's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on tourism and a relatively high standard of living, but still faces challenges in terms of accessibility and reliability, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 60%\nRoad Network: 2,590 km, moderate quality with some paved roads\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 5 international, 15 domestic\nMajor Ports: 3 major\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nFrench Polynesia's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other Pacific island territories, with significant investments in recent years to improve the quality of roads, ports, and telecommunications. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with Papeete and other major towns enjoying better access to amenities and services. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of new infrastructure projects and the upgrading of existing ones. Despite these efforts, the territory's remote location and limited resources continue to pose challenges to the development of its infrastructure.\n\nThe territory's infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on enhancing the tourism sector and promoting economic growth. The government has invested heavily in the development of new hotels, resorts, and other tourism-related infrastructure, which has helped to boost the local economy. However, the lack of connectivity between the islands and the high cost of transportation remain significant challenges. The government is working to address these issues through the development of new air and sea links, as well as the improvement of existing transportation infrastructure.\n\nFrench Polynesia's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and tsunamis, which can cause significant damage to roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. The government has implemented various measures to mitigate the impact of these events, including the development of emergency response plans and the construction of cyclone-resistant buildings. However, more needs to be done to enhance the resilience of the territory's infrastructure and to protect the local population and economy from the impacts of natural disasters.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 2,590 km | Moderate | Some paved roads, but many are unpaved and prone to flooding |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in French Polynesia |\n| Airports | 20 | Good | 5 international airports and 15 domestic airports, with regular flights to Tahiti and other islands |\n| Ports | 3 major | Good | Well-equipped ports in Papeete, Tahiti, and Moorea, with regular cargo and passenger services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- French Polynesia's power generation is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a small proportion of **renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power.\n- The territory's electricity grid is relatively reliable, with **outages** occurring occasionally due to storms or equipment failures.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to promote the use of **renewable energy** and reduce the territory's dependence on fossil fuels.\n- French Polynesia has set a target of generating 50% of its electricity from **renewable sources** by 2025.\n- The territory's energy sector is regulated by the **French Polynesian Energy Agency**, which is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of energy policies.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink in French Polynesia, with regular testing and treatment to ensure quality.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with most households having access to modern sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** is a challenge in some rural areas, where communities may rely on **rainwater collection** or **wells** for their water supply.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **water management** and reduce the risk of **water-borne diseases**.\n- **Wastewater treatment** is also a priority, with the government investing in new treatment plants and upgrading existing infrastructure to protect the territory's **marine environment**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in French Polynesia, with most areas having access to **4G** networks.\n- **Fiber-optic** connections are available in some areas, particularly in Papeete and other major towns.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **broadband** access and increase **internet penetration**.\n- **Postal services** are available throughout the territory, with regular mail and parcel services to and from France and other countries.\n- The territory's telecommunications sector is regulated by the **French Polynesian Telecommunications Agency**, which is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of telecommunications policies.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major **infrastructure development program** to improve the territory's roads, ports, and airports.\n- A new **airport** is being built in Tahiti, with a planned completion date of 2025.\n- The government is also investing in **renewable energy** projects, including **solar** and **wind** farms, to reduce the territory's dependence on fossil fuels.\n- A new **water treatment plant** is being built in Papeete to improve the quality of the territory's drinking water.\n- The government has also launched a **broadband expansion** program to increase **internet access** and improve **telecommunications** services throughout the territory.",
