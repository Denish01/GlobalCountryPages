Peak season: July and August. Budget season: November and April. Avoid: January, February, and March due to the wet season, and December due to the holiday crowds and high prices. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nFrench Polynesia has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 70°F to 85°F (21°C to 30°C). This is the best time to visit French Polynesia, as the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and hiking. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by higher temperatures and humidity, with frequent rain showers and occasional cyclones. The wet season can make travel more challenging, especially to the more remote islands.\n\nThe climate in French Polynesia varies depending on the island and the elevation. The **Society Islands**, which include Tahiti and Bora Bora, have a more humid climate than the **Tuamotu Islands**, which are known for their dry and sunny weather. The **Marquesas Islands** have a more rugged climate, with higher temperatures and more frequent rain showers. Understanding the different climate zones and seasons is essential to planning a trip to French Polynesia, as it can affect the availability of certain activities and the overall travel experience.\n\nThe seasons in French Polynesia also affect the crowds and prices. During the peak season, which runs from July to August, the islands are crowded with tourists, and prices for accommodations and activities are at their highest. The budget season, which runs from November to April, is a good time to visit French Polynesia for travelers on a budget, as prices are lower and there are fewer crowds. However, the wet season can make travel more challenging, and some activities may not be available.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Hot and humid, frequent rain showers | Low | $ | Surfing, whale watching |\n| February | Hot and humid, frequent rain showers | Low | $ | Surfing, snorkeling |\n| March | Warm and sunny, occasional rain showers | Low | $ | Snorkeling, diving |\n| April | Warm and sunny, occasional rain showers | Medium | $$ | Diving, hiking |\n| May | Warm and sunny, low humidity | Medium | $$ | Hiking, island hopping |\n| June | Warm and sunny, low humidity | Medium | $$ | Island hopping, cultural events |\n| July | Warm and sunny, low humidity | High | $$$ | Snorkeling, diving, peak season |\n| August | Warm and sunny, low humidity | High | $$$ | Snorkeling, diving, peak season |\n| September | Warm and sunny, low humidity | Medium | $$ | Diving, hiking, cultural events |\n| October | Warm and sunny, low humidity | Medium | $$ | Island hopping, cultural events |\n| November | Warm and sunny, occasional rain showers | Low | $ | Surfing, whale watching |\n| December | Hot and humid, frequent rain showers | High | $$$ | Christmas and New Year's celebrations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Heiva i Tahiti | July | A festival of traditional Tahitian music, dance, and sports |\n| Tahiti International Golf Tournament | June | A golf tournament that attracts players from around the world |\n| Bora Bora Liquid Festival | May | A festival of water sports, including surfing, paddleboarding, and snorkeling |\n| Marquesas Arts Festival | October | A festival of traditional Marquesan arts, including music, dance, and crafts |\n| Tahiti Carnival | February and March | A carnival with parades, music, and dancing |\n| Hawaiki Nui Va'a | October and November | A traditional Polynesian canoe race that takes place between the islands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Society Islands**, which include Tahiti and Bora Bora, have a more humid climate than the other islands, with higher temperatures and more frequent rain showers.\n- The **Tuamotu Islands** are known for their dry and sunny weather, making them a good destination for travelers who prefer a more arid climate.\n- The **Marquesas Islands** have a more rugged climate, with higher temperatures and more frequent rain showers, making them a good destination for travelers who enjoy hiking and outdoor activities.\n- The **Austral Islands** have a more subtropical climate, with cooler temperatures and more frequent rain showers, making them a good destination for travelers who prefer a milder climate.\n- The **Gambier Islands** have a more isolated climate, with limited access to certain activities and amenities, making them a good destination for travelers who prefer a more secluded and peaceful experience.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book accommodations and activities well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, which runs from April to May and September to November, for lower prices and fewer crowds.\n- Pack **lightweight and breathable clothing**, as well as **sunscreen and insect repellent**, to protect against the sun and insects.\n- Be aware of the **holiday seasons**, including Christmas and New Year's, when prices are higher and crowds are larger.\n- Consider purchasing **travel insurance** to protect against unexpected events, such as natural disasters or trip cancellations.\n- Research and understand the **local customs and traditions**, including the importance of respect for the environment and the local culture.",
