[SECTION] Overview: French Polynesia vs Hawaii [/SECTION]
French Polynesia and Hawaii are two popular island destinations in the Pacific, known for their stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. However, when it comes to cost of living, there are significant differences between the two. French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France, has a higher cost of living due to its remote location and limited economy. On the other hand, Hawaii, a state in the United States, has a more developed economy and a larger population, which contributes to its lower cost of living. Overall, Hawaii is around 20-30% cheaper than French Polynesia, making it a more affordable option for expats, tourists, and locals alike.

The economic context of the two destinations also plays a significant role in their cost of living. French Polynesia's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which can drive up prices for accommodation, food, and activities. In contrast, Hawaii's economy is more diversified, with a strong presence of industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and technology. This diversity helps to keep prices in check and provides a more stable economic environment. Additionally, Hawaii's larger population and more developed infrastructure contribute to its lower cost of living, making it an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable island lifestyle.
