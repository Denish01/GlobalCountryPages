[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The political system of French Polynesia is based on the principles of **democracy** and **decentralization**, with the French government responsible for defense, foreign affairs, and some domestic policies, while the local government has autonomy over matters such as education, healthcare, and economic development. The **separation of powers** is ensured by the existence of an executive, legislative, and judicial branch, with the President of French Polynesia serving as the head of government and the Assembly of French Polynesia acting as the legislative body. French Polynesia has a **unitary** system of government, with the central government in Papeete exercising authority over the entire territory.

The **local government** has a significant degree of autonomy, with the President of French Polynesia and the Assembly of French Polynesia responsible for managing local affairs. The **French government** also plays a role in the governance of French Polynesia, with the French President serving as the head of state and the French government responsible for defense and foreign affairs. The **High Commissioner of the Republic**, appointed by the French government, represents the French state in French Polynesia and is responsible for ensuring the implementation of French laws and policies.

The **relationship between the French government and the local government** is governed by the Organic Law of 2004, which established the framework for the autonomy of French Polynesia.

The **cooperation between the two governments** is facilitated by regular meetings between the President of French Polynesia and the French government, as well as by the presence of French officials in French Polynesia.
