[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in French Polynesia is overseen by the French government, and as such, it follows the French education system. Public schools in French Polynesia are generally considered to be of good quality, with French being the primary language of instruction. However, some schools also offer instruction in Tahitian, particularly in the earlier years of education. Compulsory education in French Polynesia lasts for 10 years, from the age of 6 to 16. International schools are also available in French Polynesia, particularly in the capital city of Papeete, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and the French baccalaureate.

The quality of education in French Polynesia is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and French language and literature. However, some critics have argued that the education system in French Polynesia can be overly focused on theoretical knowledge, and that more emphasis should be placed on practical skills and vocational training. Despite these criticisms, French Polynesia has a highly educated population, with a literacy rate of over 98%. The education system in French Polynesia is also relatively accessible, with a range of scholarships and financial assistance programs available to students from low-income backgrounds.
