Public schools in French Polynesia are generally considered to be of good quality, with French being the primary language of instruction. However, some schools also offer instruction in Tahitian, particularly in the earlier years of education. Compulsory education in French Polynesia lasts for 10 years, from the age of 6 to 16. International schools are also available in French Polynesia, particularly in the capital city of Papeete, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and the French baccalaureate.\n\nThe quality of education in French Polynesia is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and French language and literature. However, some critics have argued that the education system in French Polynesia can be overly focused on theoretical knowledge, and that more emphasis should be placed on practical skills and vocational training. Despite these criticisms, French Polynesia has a highly educated population, with a literacy rate of over 98%. The education system in French Polynesia is also relatively accessible, with a range of scholarships and financial assistance programs available to students from low-income backgrounds.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, French language of instruction |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of quality, some schools offer bilingual instruction |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Good quality education, French language of instruction |\n| Private Secondary | $3,000-$7,000 | Range of quality, some schools offer bilingual instruction |\n| International School | $8,000-$10,000 | High-quality education, range of curricula including IB and French baccalaureate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$4,000 | University of French Polynesia, range of programs including business and engineering |\n| Private University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Range of programs, some universities offer online courses |\n| Top-Ranked University | $4,000-$8,000 | $6,000-$12,000 | University of French Polynesia, highly regarded for programs in business and tourism |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Range of quality, some schools offer bilingual instruction |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $30-$75 | Range of quality, some tutors offer online instruction |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Range of languages, including French, English, and Tahitian |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100-$300 | Range of costs, depending on school and program |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for some schools, range of costs depending on school and quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The University of French Polynesia is considered to be one of the top-ranked universities in the region, offering a range of programs including business, engineering, and tourism.\n- International schools in French Polynesia offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the French baccalaureate, making them a popular choice for expat families.\n- Scholarships are available for students from low-income backgrounds, including the **Ecole de la République** scholarship program.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in French Polynesia, with some universities and schools offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The education system in French Polynesia is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and French language and literature.\n- Expats and international students may find it helpful to learn some French before arriving in French Polynesia, as it is the primary language of instruction and will make it easier to navigate the education system.",
