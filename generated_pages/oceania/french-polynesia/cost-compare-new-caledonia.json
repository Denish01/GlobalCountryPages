French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France, has a relatively small economy with a strong focus on tourism, while New Caledonia, a special collectivity of France, has a more diversified economy with significant mining and agricultural sectors. The cost of living in French Polynesia is generally higher due to its remote location and dependence on imports, whereas New Caledonia's economy is more self-sufficient, leading to lower prices for food, housing, and other essentials. Overall, New Caledonia is around 15-20% cheaper than French Polynesia, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\nThe economic context of both territories plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. French Polynesia's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which drives up prices for accommodation, food, and activities. In contrast, New Caledonia's economy is more diversified, with a strong mining sector and a growing agricultural industry, which helps to keep prices stable. Additionally, New Caledonia's proximity to Australia and other Pacific Island nations makes it easier to import goods, reducing transportation costs and contributing to lower prices.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | French Polynesia (USD) | New Caledonia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 600 | 25% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 400 | 20% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,800 | 1,400 | 22% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | French Polynesia (USD) | New Caledonia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 800 | 600 | 25% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 4 | 20% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2.50 | 17% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | French Polynesia (USD) | New Caledonia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 60 | 40 | 33% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1.50 | 25% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.00 | 17% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | French Polynesia (USD) | New Caledonia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 120 | 20% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 40 | 20% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n| Mobile Plan | 30 | 25 | 17% cheaper in New Caledonia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | French Polynesia (USD) | New Caledonia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 900 | 25% savings in New Caledonia |\n| Mid-Range | 2,000 | 1,600 | 20% savings in New Caledonia |\n| Comfortable | 3,500 | 2,800 | 20% savings in New Caledonia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **French Polynesia is cheaper for:**\n  - Luxury tourism activities, such as island hopping and fine dining\n  - High-end accommodation options, such as overwater bungalows\n  - Unique cultural experiences, such as traditional Tahitian dance performances\n  - Scuba diving and snorkeling trips to explore the island's coral reefs\n- **New Caledonia is cheaper for:**\n  - Everyday essentials, such as groceries and transportation\n  - Mid-range accommodation options, such as apartments and guesthouses\n  - Outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping\n  - Visiting local markets and trying traditional Kanak cuisine\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, New Caledonia offers better value for money due to its lower cost of living and more affordable accommodation options.
