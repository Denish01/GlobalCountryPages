# The Truth About French Polynesia - History & Real Facts

French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France, is a complex and multifaceted territory that is often misunderstood by the general public, with many people getting its geography, culture, and history wrong.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
French Polynesia has a rich and diverse history, with the first Polynesian settlers arriving around 1000 AD. The islands were later visited by European explorers, including British captain James Cook, who arrived in 1769. In 1842, France established a protectorate over the islands, and in 1880, France annexed the islands, making them a French colony. French Polynesia became an overseas territory of France in 1946, and in 2004, it was reclassified as an overseas collectivity. Today, French Polynesia has a significant degree of autonomy, with its own local government and president.

The history of French Polynesia is also marked by the impact of European colonization, which had a significant effect on the local population and culture. The introduction of new diseases, such as smallpox and tuberculosis, had a devastating impact on the population, while the imposition of European customs and traditions also had a significant impact on the local way of life. Despite this, the people of French Polynesia have maintained a strong sense of identity and culture, with many still speaking the Tahitian language and practicing traditional customs.

In terms of classification, French Polynesia is an overseas collectivity of France, which means that it has a significant degree of autonomy, but is still subject to the authority of the French government. This classification has been in place since 2004, and has given French Polynesia a greater degree of control over its own affairs, while still maintaining strong ties with France.

The timeline of French Polynesia's history is complex, with many significant events and dates. Some of the key dates include 1000 AD, when the first Polynesian settlers arrived, 1769, when James Cook arrived, 1842, when France established a protectorate, and 2004, when French Polynesia became an overseas collectivity.
