The cost of living in French Polynesia is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which increases the price of goods and services. Eating out is a popular culture in French Polynesia, with many restaurants serving a mix of French, Polynesian, and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also a common practice, with many locals opting to buy fresh produce and seafood from local markets to prepare traditional dishes.\n\nThe prices of food in French Polynesia can vary depending on the location, with restaurants and shops in tourist areas tend to be more expensive than those in local neighborhoods. Additionally, the prices of imported goods, such as meat and dairy products, can be higher than those of local products, such as fish and fruits. Overall, the cost of food in French Polynesia can be high, but with some planning and knowledge of where to shop and what to buy, it is possible to eat well without breaking the bank.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 250 XPF | imported from France |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.00 | 200 XPF | local bakery |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $3.00 | 300 XPF | local farm |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50 | 150 XPF | imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8.00 | 800 XPF | imported from France |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12.00 | 1200 XPF | imported from Australia |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 500 XPF | imported from New Zealand |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3.50 | 350 XPF | local farm |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 250 XPF | local farm |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $2.00 | 200 XPF | local farm |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10.00 | 1000 XPF | made from local milk |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2.00 | 200 XPF | local brand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-15 | traditional dishes like **Poisson Cru** and **Ahima'a** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-30 | one person, **French-Polynesian** cuisine |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-60 | 3 courses, **seafood** and **meat** options |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-100 | upscale, **international** cuisine |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-7 | **Hinano** beer, brewed locally |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-10 | **Heineken** and other international brands |\n| Cappuccino | $5-7 | **coffee** and **pastries** available |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $3-5 | **Coca-Cola** and other international brands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of goods at supermarkets and local markets in French Polynesia can vary significantly.
