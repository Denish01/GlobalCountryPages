The cuisine is characterized by the use of fresh seafood, coconut milk, and tropical fruits, which are abundant in the islands. The traditional Polynesian method of cooking in an underground oven, known as **Ahima'a**, is still practiced today, and is an important part of the local food culture. Regional variations can be found in the different islands, with the Society Islands, including Tahiti and Moorea, being known for their **Ma'a Tahiti**, a traditional Polynesian feast.\n\nThe French influence on the cuisine is evident in the use of **baguettes** and **croissants**, which are staples in many bakeries and cafes. Asian flavors, particularly Chinese and Japanese, have also been incorporated into the local cuisine, with dishes such as **Poulet au Coco** (chicken in coconut milk) and **Sashimi de Poisson** (raw fish sashimi) being popular. The cuisine in French Polynesia is also known for its use of **Tahitian vanilla**, which is considered to be one of the best in the world.\n\nThe food culture in French Polynesia is not just about the cuisine, but also about the social and cultural context in which it is consumed. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to socialize and bond with family and friends, and the traditional **Ma'a Tahiti** is an important part of this social bonding. The cuisine is also closely tied to the local culture and traditions, with many dishes being prepared and consumed during special occasions and celebrations.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes
