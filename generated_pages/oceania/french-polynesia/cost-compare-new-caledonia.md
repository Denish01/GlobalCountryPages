[SECTION] Overview: French Polynesia vs New Caledonia [/SECTION]
French Polynesia and New Caledonia are two territories in the Pacific Ocean with distinct economic profiles. French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France, has a relatively small economy with a strong focus on tourism, while New Caledonia, a special collectivity of France, has a more diversified economy with significant mining and agricultural sectors. The cost of living in French Polynesia is generally higher due to its remote location and dependence on imports, whereas New Caledonia's economy is more self-sufficient, leading to lower prices for food, housing, and other essentials. Overall, New Caledonia is around 15-20% cheaper than French Polynesia, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of both territories plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. French Polynesia's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which drives up prices for accommodation, food, and activities.
