  "content": "To live in French Polynesia, you would need around $2,500-$3,500 per month for a comfortable lifestyle, $1,500-$2,500 for mid-range living, and $1,000-$1,500 for budget living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP per Capita (PPP): $22,993\nBudget Living (monthly): $1,200 USD\nMid-Range Living (monthly): $2,000 USD\nComfortable Living (monthly): $3,200 USD\nAverage Local Salary: $2,500 USD/month, approximate\nCurrency: XPF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]\nFrench Polynesia is considered to be one of the more expensive destinations in the Pacific, with a high cost of living due to its remote location and reliance on imports. The GDP per capita (PPP) of $22,993 reflects the territory's high standard of living, but it also means that prices for goods and services are relatively high. A budget of $1,200 per month would be sufficient for a basic lifestyle, including shared accommodation, cooking most meals, and using public transportation. In contrast, a mid-range budget of $2,000 per month would allow for a more comfortable lifestyle, including a one-bedroom apartment, eating out occasionally, and using a mix of public and private transportation. A comfortable lifestyle, with a budget of $3,200 per month, would provide for a nice two-bedroom apartment, frequent dining out, and the use of taxis or a car.\n\nThe cost of living in French Polynesia is comparable to that of other Pacific island nations, such as the Cook Islands and Fiji. However, it is generally more expensive than living in Southeast Asia or Latin America. The high cost of living in French Polynesia is due in part to the territory's remote location, which makes it difficult and expensive to import goods. Additionally, the territory's reliance on tourism means that prices for accommodations and activities can be high, especially during peak season.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 400 | 800 | 1,200 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 300 | 500 | 800 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 100 | 200 | 300 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 150 | 250 | 350 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 100 | 200 | 300 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 200 | 300 | 500 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 100 | 200 | 300 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 200 | 300 | 500 | |\n| **Total** | **1,250** | **2,150** | **3,450** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle in French Polynesia would be quite basic, with a focus on saving money wherever possible.
