[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
French Polynesia is accessible by air, with Faa'a International Airport (PPT) being the main entry point, located about 5 kilometers southwest of Papeete, the capital city. The airport receives direct flights from major cities such as Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Auckland, as well as connections through Paris and other European cities. Overland entry points are limited, as French Polynesia is an island territory, but you can also arrive by sea, either by cruise ship or private yacht.

The main international airport, Faa'a International Airport, is well-connected to the rest of the world, with Air Tahiti Nui being the main carrier, offering direct flights to several destinations, including Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Auckland. Other airlines, such as Air France, Qantas, and LATAM, also operate flights to French Polynesia, often with connections through their respective hubs. Additionally, some cruise lines offer itineraries that include French Polynesia, allowing passengers to experience the islands while only unpacking once.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Air Tahiti is the main domestic carrier in French Polynesia, operating an extensive network of flights to over 40 islands, including popular destinations such as Bora Bora, Moorea, and Huahine. The airline offers regular services, with multiple daily flights to some of the more popular islands, and less frequent flights to the more remote atolls. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be high and availability limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $500, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There are no trains or rail networks in French Polynesia, making air travel and sea transportation the primary modes of getting around the islands. As a result, there are no high-speed options or booking processes to consider, and travelers will need to rely on other forms of transportation to get around.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Inter-city bus companies operate on some of the larger islands, such as Tahiti and Moorea, offering a convenient and affordable way to get around. The buses are generally of moderate quality, with regular services connecting major towns and cities. Costs are relatively low, with fares starting from around $2, making bus travel a great option for those on a budget.
