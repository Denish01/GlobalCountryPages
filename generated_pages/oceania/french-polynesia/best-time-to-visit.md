[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
French Polynesia has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 70°F to 85°F (21°C to 30°C). This is the best time to visit French Polynesia, as the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and hiking. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by higher temperatures and humidity, with frequent rain showers and occasional cyclones. The wet season can make travel more challenging, especially to the more remote islands.

The climate in French Polynesia varies depending on the island and the elevation. The **Society Islands**, which include Tahiti and Bora Bora, have a more humid climate than the **Tuamotu Islands**, which are known for their dry and sunny weather. The **Marquesas Islands** have a more rugged climate, with higher temperatures and more frequent rain showers. Understanding the different climate zones and seasons is essential to planning a trip to French Polynesia, as it can affect the availability of certain activities and the overall travel experience.

The seasons in French Polynesia also affect the crowds and prices. During the peak season, which runs from July to August, the islands are crowded with tourists, and prices for accommodations and activities are at their highest. The budget season, which runs from November to April, is a good time to visit French Polynesia for travelers on a budget, as prices are lower and there are fewer crowds. However, the wet season can make travel more challenging, and some activities may not be available.
