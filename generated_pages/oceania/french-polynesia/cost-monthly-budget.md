[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
French Polynesia is considered to be one of the more expensive destinations in the Pacific, with a high cost of living due to its remote location and reliance on imports. The GDP per capita (PPP) of $22,993 reflects the territory's high standard of living, but it also means that prices for goods and services are relatively high. A budget of $1,200 per month would be sufficient for a basic lifestyle, including shared accommodation, cooking most meals, and using public transportation. In contrast, a mid-range budget of $2,000 per month would allow for a more comfortable lifestyle, including a one-bedroom apartment, eating out occasionally, and using a mix of public and private transportation. A comfortable lifestyle, with a budget of $3,200 per month, would provide for a nice two-bedroom apartment, frequent dining out, and the use of taxis or a car.

The cost of living in French Polynesia is comparable to that of other Pacific island nations, such as the Cook Islands and Fiji. However, it is generally more expensive than living in Southeast Asia or Latin America. The high cost of living in French Polynesia is due in part to the territory's remote location, which makes it difficult and expensive to import goods. Additionally, the territory's reliance on tourism means that prices for accommodations and activities can be high, especially during peak season.

[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]
A budget lifestyle in French Polynesia would be quite basic, with a focus on saving money wherever possible. You would likely live in a shared apartment or house outside of the city center, cook most of your meals, and use public transportation to get around. You would not have much money for entertainment or leisure activities, and would have to be careful with your expenses to make ends meet. For example, you might spend your free time hiking or visiting the local market, rather than going out to restaurants or bars.

A mid-range lifestyle in French Polynesia would provide for a more comfortable standard of living, with a one-bedroom apartment in the city center and the ability to eat out occasionally. You would have more money for entertainment and leisure activities, such as going to the movies or taking a weekend trip to a nearby island. However, you would still have to be mindful of your expenses, and might have to make some sacrifices in order to stay within your budget. For example, you might choose to cook at home most nights, but splurge on a nice dinner out on the weekends.

A comfortable lifestyle in French Polynesia would provide for a high standard of living, with a nice two-bedroom apartment and the ability to eat out frequently. You would have plenty of money for entertainment and leisure activities, such as taking a boat tour or going on a snorkeling trip. You would also have the ability to travel to other islands in the territory, or even to other countries in the Pacific. For example, you might take a week-long trip to the island of Bora Bora, or spend a weekend in Auckland, New Zealand.
