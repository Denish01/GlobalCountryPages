However, there is still a noticeable urban vs rural divide, with internet speeds and availability being much better in urban areas like Papeete, the capital city, compared to rural islands. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by weather conditions, such as heavy rainfall or cyclones, which can cause outages and disruptions.

In general, the internet quality in French Polynesia is suitable for most users, including remote workers and tourists, who can easily stay connected with family and friends back home. However, online gamers and those who require very high-speed connections for work or other purposes may find the internet speeds to be somewhat limited. Overall, the internet in French Polynesia is relatively good, but it's essential to have realistic expectations, especially when traveling to more remote areas.

These carriers have stores and resellers located throughout the main islands, including at the airport and in major towns. To purchase a SIM card, you will typically need to provide a **passport** and proof of address, and the cost will depend on the carrier and the type of plan you choose.
