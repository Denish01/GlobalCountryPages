  "content": "The cost of healthcare in French Polynesia can vary depending on the type of care and whether you are using public or private healthcare services, with public services generally being more affordable for locals and those with insurance.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $945\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 21.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 15\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XPF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nFrench Polynesia has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private healthcare services available. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality and is accessible to locals and those with insurance, while private healthcare services are also available for those who can afford them. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, and most medical services are covered by the government's social security system. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially for private services. The system works well for locals, but foreigners may find it challenging to navigate, especially if they do not speak French or Tahitian.\n\nThe quality of public healthcare in French Polynesia is generally good, with well-equipped hospitals and trained medical staff. However, the public healthcare system can be slow, and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, offer faster and more personalized care, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is essential to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially for private services. Many insurance providers offer policies that cover medical expenses in French Polynesia, including emergency medical evacuations to other countries if necessary.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist consultations, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Medical expenses in French Polynesia and abroad, emergency medical evacuations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and can cost between $5-$20 per item\n- Pharmacies are available in major towns and cities, but may be limited in rural areas\n- Prescription rules are similar to those in France, and medication can only be dispensed with a valid prescription\n- Common medications such as painkillers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$20 per packet\n- Pharmacy hours are generally limited to business hours, but some pharmacies may be open late or on weekends\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 15, or visit the nearest hospital. The emergency services in French Polynesia are well-equipped to handle medical emergencies, and ambulance services are available in major towns and cities. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations, as the cost of emergency care can be high. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally the private hospitals, which offer high-quality care and have English-speaking staff. However, these hospitals can be expensive, and it is essential to have insurance that covers medical expenses.\n\nFor foreigners, it is crucial to research and understand the emergency care options available in French Polynesia before traveling. Many hotels and resorts have on-site medical facilities or can arrange for medical care in the event of an emergency. Additionally, some insurance providers offer emergency medical evacuation services, which can be lifesaving in the event of a serious medical emergency. It is also a good idea to learn some basic French and Tahitian phrases, such as \"help\" and \"hospital,\" to ensure that you can communicate effectively in the event of an emergency.",
