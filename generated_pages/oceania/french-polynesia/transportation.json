  "content": "To get around in French Polynesia, you can use a variety of transportation options including domestic flights, buses, taxis, and car rentals, with the most convenient option depending on your budget, time constraints, and personal preferences.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Faa'a International Airport (PPT)\nDomestic Air Network: extensive\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nFrench Polynesia is accessible by air, with Faa'a International Airport (PPT) being the main entry point, located about 5 kilometers southwest of Papeete, the capital city. The airport receives direct flights from major cities such as Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Auckland, as well as connections through Paris and other European cities. Overland entry points are limited, as French Polynesia is an island territory, but you can also arrive by sea, either by cruise ship or private yacht.\n\nThe main international airport, Faa'a International Airport, is well-connected to the rest of the world, with Air Tahiti Nui being the main carrier, offering direct flights to several destinations, including Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Auckland. Other airlines, such as Air France, Qantas, and LATAM, also operate flights to French Polynesia, often with connections through their respective hubs. Additionally, some cruise lines offer itineraries that include French Polynesia, allowing passengers to experience the islands while only unpacking once.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nAir Tahiti is the main domestic carrier in French Polynesia, operating an extensive network of flights to over 40 islands, including popular destinations such as Bora Bora, Moorea, and Huahine. The airline offers regular services, with multiple daily flights to some of the more popular islands, and less frequent flights to the more remote atolls. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be high and availability limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $500, depending on the route and time of year.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere are no trains or rail networks in French Polynesia, making air travel and sea transportation the primary modes of getting around the islands. As a result, there are no high-speed options or booking processes to consider, and travelers will need to rely on other forms of transportation to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nInter-city bus companies operate on some of the larger islands, such as Tahiti and Moorea, offering a convenient and affordable way to get around. The buses are generally of moderate quality, with regular services connecting major towns and cities. Costs are relatively low, with fares starting from around $2, making bus travel a great option for those on a budget.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Papeete, Moorea | $2-$5 | Regular services, moderate quality |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $10-$20/km | Available, but can be expensive |\n| Ride-Hailing | Papeete | $10-$20 | Local alternatives, such as Tahiti Taxi |\n| Ferry | Between islands | $20-$50 | Regular services, scenic routes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in French Polynesia, you will need a valid driver's license from your home country, which is accepted for up to 12 months.\n- Road conditions are generally moderate, with paved roads on the larger islands, but can be poor on some of the more remote atolls.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, due to the remote location of the islands.\n- Car rental companies are available, with a range of vehicles to choose from, including economy cars, SUVs, and 4WDs.\n- When renting a car, be sure to check the vehicle's condition and insurance coverage, as well as any additional fees or charges.\n- Hazards to watch out for include narrow roads, steep inclines, and limited parking options, especially in Papeete.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced taxi fares or fake tour operators.\n- **Payment methods** vary, with some businesses accepting credit cards, while others only accept cash, so it's a good idea to have a combination of both.\n- Download the **Tahiti Taxi** app to book a ride-hailing service in Papeete.\n- Consider purchasing a **local SIM card** or portable Wi-Fi hotspot to stay connected and access maps and other travel information.\n- Be mindful of **sea conditions** when traveling by ferry, as rough seas can cause delays or cancellations.\n- Respect **local customs** and traditions, especially when visiting remote atolls or attending cultural events.\n- Learn some basic **French** and **Tahitian** phrases, such as \"bonjour\" (hello) and \"mauruuru\" (thank you), to show respect for the local culture.\n- Stay **informed** about weather conditions, especially during the cyclone season, which runs from November to April.",
