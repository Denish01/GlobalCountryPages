[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in French Polynesia is relatively small and niche, driven primarily by tourism and foreign investment. The market has experienced steady growth in recent years, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per annum. The urban areas, such as Papeete, tend to be more expensive than the rural areas, with prices ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 per square meter. The rental market is also strong, with many tourists and expats looking for short-term and long-term rentals. The demand for luxury properties, particularly in areas like Bora Bora and Moorea, is high, driven by the growing tourism industry.

The market is also influenced by the limited availability of land, particularly in the more desirable areas. This has led to a trend towards **apartment living** and **condo developments**, particularly in Papeete. The government has also implemented measures to encourage foreign investment, including tax incentives and streamlined approval processes. However, the market can be volatile, and prices may fluctuate depending on factors such as global economic trends and changes in government policies.

In terms of trends, there is a growing demand for **eco-tourism** and **sustainable living**, with many buyers looking for properties that are environmentally friendly and offer a unique cultural experience. This has led to an increase in the development of **eco-lodges** and **green resorts**, particularly in the outer islands.
