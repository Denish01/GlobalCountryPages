[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
French Polynesia has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher prices during the peak tourist season from June to September. The territory's remote location and limited connectivity to the global grid also contribute to higher utility costs. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the island, with Tahiti and Moorea tend to have higher prices than the outer islands.

The quality of the utility infrastructure in French Polynesia is generally good, with a high level of access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there can be occasional outages and disruptions, particularly during periods of high demand or severe weather events. The government and utility providers are working to improve the infrastructure and reduce the risk of outages, but it is still important for residents and visitors to be aware of the potential for disruptions and plan accordingly.
