[SECTION] How Expensive Is French Polynesia? [/SECTION]
French Polynesia is one of the most expensive destinations in the Pacific, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation comparable to those in major cities in Western Europe or North America. The cost of living in French Polynesia is driven by its remote location, limited economy, and reliance on imports. Compared to its neighbors, such as the Cook Islands, French Polynesia is generally more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and dining. However, the unique culture, stunning natural beauty, and high standard of living make French Polynesia a popular destination for tourists and expats willing to pay a premium for the experience.

The high cost of living in French Polynesia is also due to the fact that many goods are imported from France or other countries, which increases their price. Additionally, the territory's limited economy and lack of competition in certain sectors, such as transportation and accommodation, can drive up prices. Despite these factors, French Polynesia remains a popular destination for those seeking a unique and luxurious experience in the Pacific.
