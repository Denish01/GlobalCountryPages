As a result, utility costs can be high and fluctuating, with prices often increasing during peak demand periods. The Tuvaluan government has implemented measures to improve the energy sector, including the introduction of solar power and energy-efficient technologies, but the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for households and businesses.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Tuvalu also varies by season, with higher prices during the dry season (May to October) due to increased demand for electricity and water. During this period, the cost of electricity can increase by up to 20%, while water prices may rise by up to 15%. In contrast, the wet season (November to April) tends to have lower utility costs, with prices decreasing by up to 10% for electricity and 5% for water.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $150 | $250 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | Not applicable |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | Included in municipal fees |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$195** | **$310** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Tuvalu Telecom |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 60 Mbps | Tuvalu Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Tuvalu Telecom, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-10 GB | Tuvalu Telecom, Digicel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Tuvalu Telecom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | Available through Tuvalu Telecom |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | Available through Tuvalu Telecom |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Limited options available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Tuvalu, it is recommended to contact the relevant service providers, such as Tuvalu Telecom for internet and phone services, and the Tuvaluan government for electricity and water connections.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households and businesses manage their energy costs and avoid disconnections.\n- The best internet providers in Tuvalu are Tuvalu Telecom and Digicel, which offer a range of plans and services, including fiber internet and mobile data.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and harvest rainwater for non-potable purposes.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with service providers for the best rates, especially for businesses or long-term contracts.",
