[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The housing market in Tuvalu is relatively small and limited, with a high demand for rentals due to the country's growing population and expat community. The rental market is mostly driven by the government and international organizations, which provide accommodation for their employees. Typical lease terms in Tuvalu range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the Tuvaluan law, but the rental market is largely unregulated, and disputes are often resolved through negotiation. Compared to regional neighbors like Fiji and Kiribati, Tuvalu's housing costs are relatively high due to its limited land area and high demand for accommodation.

The Tuvaluan government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage, including the construction of new housing estates and the renovation of existing buildings. However, the housing market remains competitive, and renters may need to act quickly to secure a suitable property. Expats and foreigners may face additional challenges in finding accommodation, as the rental market is largely geared towards locals and government employees. As a result, it is essential for renters to research the market thoroughly and work with reputable real estate agents or landlords to find a suitable property.
