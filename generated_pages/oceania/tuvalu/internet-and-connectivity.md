[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Tuvalu is relatively slow and limited, with an average download speed of 5 Mbps, which can make it difficult to stream videos or download large files. However, the internet is generally reliable, and most users can access basic online services such as email and social media. There is a significant urban vs rural divide in terms of internet access, with the capital Funafuti having better coverage and faster speeds than the outer islands. The reliability of the internet can be affected by weather conditions, such as heavy rainfall or cyclones, which can cause outages and disruptions.

The Tuvaluan government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the installation of a new submarine fiber-optic cable, which is expected to increase internet speeds and reduce costs. However, the country's remote location and limited resources continue to pose challenges to the development of its internet sector. Despite these challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for many Tuvaluans, particularly in the capital, where it is used for communication, education, and business.
