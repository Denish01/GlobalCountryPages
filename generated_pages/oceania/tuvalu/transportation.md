[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main airport in Tuvalu is the Funafuti International Airport, which is located on the atoll of Funafuti and serves as the primary entry point for visitors. There are direct flights to Funafuti from Fiji, which is the primary hub for international flights to Tuvalu. Visitors can fly to Fiji from major airports around the world and then connect to a domestic flight to Tuvalu. The flight from Fiji to Tuvalu is approximately 2.5 hours, and flights are operated by Fiji Airways and other regional airlines.

Overland entry points do not exist in Tuvalu, as it is an island nation with no land borders. The country is composed of nine islands, and the only way to arrive is by air or sea. There are no international bus or train services that connect Tuvalu to other countries, and the majority of visitors arrive by air. The airport is small, with limited facilities, but it is well-organized and efficient, with friendly staff to assist with arrivals and departures.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in Tuvalu are limited, but there are regular flights between the main islands, including Funafuti, Nanumea, Nanumaga, and Niutao. The domestic airline, Air Kiribati, operates these flights, but the schedule can be irregular and subject to change. It is essential to book flights in advance, as the demand for seats can be high, especially during peak travel seasons. The cost of domestic flights can vary, but approximate costs range from $100 to $200 USD for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are no intercity bus companies in Tuvalu, but there are local buses that operate on the main islands, including Funafuti.
