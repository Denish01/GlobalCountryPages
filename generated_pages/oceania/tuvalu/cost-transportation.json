The most common mode of transportation is by foot or bicycle, as the distances between villages and towns are relatively short. For longer distances, people rely on **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which operate on a limited schedule. The quality of public transit is basic, with no **city buses** or **metro/subway** systems available. Most people get around by using the limited public transportation options or by walking.\n\nThe lack of a well-developed transportation system in Tuvalu is due to its small size and limited resources. However, the government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of new **minibus** services. Despite these efforts, transportation costs in Tuvalu can still be relatively high, especially for **fuel** and **car rentals**. The cost of **fuel** is around $1.50-$2.50 USD per liter, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | $20-$30 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Commuter Boat | $5-$10 | $50-$100 | Between islands, limited schedule |\n| City Bus | N/A | N/A | No city bus system available |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | No metro/subway system available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5-$10 | $2-$5 | $10-$20 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | No ride-hailing apps available |\n| Airport Transfer | $20-$50 | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, limited options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50-$2.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20-$2.00 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $50-$100 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | No toll roads available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Boat | $20-$50 | Between islands, limited schedule |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes and schedule |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | No train system available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider walking or cycling for short distances.\n- Use **minibuses** or **shared taxis** for longer distances, as they are relatively affordable.\n- Negotiate the fare with the **taxi driver** before starting your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- Be aware of the limited availability of **fuel** and **car rentals**, and plan accordingly.\n- Consider using **commuter boats** for intercity travel, as they can be a more affordable option.\n- Always wear a **seatbelt** and follow local traffic rules to ensure your safety while traveling in Tuvalu.",
