The country's development level is characterized by a lack of diversification, with a heavy reliance on a few key sectors, including fishing and copra production. The economy has been growing slowly over the past few years, driven by increased fishing licenses and a growing tourism sector. However, the country faces significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to finance, and a high vulnerability to climate change.
