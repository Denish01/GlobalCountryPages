[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Tuvalu is characterized by a limited supply of land and properties, which can drive up prices. The market is also heavily influenced by the country's **economic dependence** on foreign aid and the **vulnerability to climate change**. As a result, the market is subject to fluctuations and uncertainties. The current market conditions are relatively stable, with a slow but steady increase in prices over the past few years. However, the market is not without its challenges, and investors should be aware of the **risks associated with climate change**, including rising sea levels and increased frequency of natural disasters.

The urban areas, such as Funafuti, tend to have higher property prices compared to the rural areas. The price trajectory is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the limited supply of land and the growing demand for housing and commercial properties. The **urbanization trend** is also expected to continue, with more people moving to the capital city in search of better economic opportunities. The rural areas, on the other hand, are expected to remain relatively affordable, with more emphasis on traditional **subsistence farming** and **fishing activities**.

The property market in Tuvalu is also influenced by the **government's policies** and **regulations**, which can impact the supply and demand of properties. The government has implemented measures to **protect the environment** and **preserve the traditional way of life**, which can limit the development of certain areas.
