# Tuvalu Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

The culture of Tuvalu is a unique blend of traditional Polynesian customs and modern influences, shaped by its history, language, and geographic location, and is characterized by a strong sense of community and respect for tradition.

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Tuvalu's culture is defined by its Polynesian heritage, with the majority of the population identifying as ethnically Tuvaluan. The country's geographic isolation has helped to preserve its traditional way of life, with many Tuvaluans still practicing subsistence farming and fishing. The influence of Christianity, introduced by European missionaries in the 19th century, is also evident in the country's culture, with many Tuvaluans adhering to Christian values and practices. The official languages of Tuvalu are Tuvaluan and English, with Tuvaluan being the predominant language spoken in everyday life.

The ethnic makeup of Tuvalu is relatively homogeneous, with the majority of the population being Tuvaluan. However, there are also small communities of other Pacific Islanders, including Fijians and Kiribati, who have settled in Tuvalu. The linguistic makeup of the country is also predominantly Tuvaluan, with English being widely spoken as a second language. Tuvaluan culture places a strong emphasis on community and family, with extended family ties playing an important role in social organization.

Tuvaluan society is also characterized by a strong sense of respect for tradition and custom. The traditional Tuvaluan system of governance, known as the "Kaupulega", is still in place today, with village councils playing an important role in decision-making and dispute resolution. The country's cultural identity is also reflected in its traditional arts and crafts, including woodcarving, weaving, and dancing.
