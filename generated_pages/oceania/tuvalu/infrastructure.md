[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Tuvalu's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with the country facing significant challenges in providing basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation to its population. Recent investments have been made to improve the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the upgrade of existing ones. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to infrastructure services, with the capital city Funafuti having better access to amenities than rural areas. The government of Tuvalu has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on improving the overall quality of life for its citizens.

Despite these efforts, Tuvalu's infrastructure remains vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and flooding, which can have a significant impact on the country's development. The government has been working to build resilience into the country's infrastructure, including the construction of sea walls and the implementation of disaster-risk reduction measures. However, more needs to be done to address the scale and complexity of the challenges facing the country.

The lack of infrastructure development in Tuvalu is also a major constraint to the country's economic growth and development. The country's limited access to modern amenities and services makes it difficult to attract foreign investment and promote economic development. As a result, the government has been working to prioritize infrastructure development, with a focus on improving the country's transport, energy, and communications systems.
