[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Tuvalu has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of some countries eligible for visa-free access or visa on arrival, while others require a visa in advance. Currently, citizens of countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom can enter Tuvalu visa-free for up to one month, while citizens of other countries, including the United States, Canada, and India, can obtain a visa on arrival. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Tuvalu for the most up-to-date information.

Tuvalu's visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to promote tourism and economic development. The country's remote location and limited infrastructure mean that it is not a popular destination for mass tourism, but it is becoming increasingly popular with travelers looking for a unique and unspoiled Pacific island experience. As a result, the government of Tuvalu is keen to attract visitors who can contribute to the country's economic development, while also ensuring that the country's environment and culture are protected.
