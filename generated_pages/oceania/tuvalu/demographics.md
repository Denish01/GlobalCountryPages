[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Tuvalu is relatively small, with a total of approximately 10,643 people, according to the latest estimates. The population growth rate is approximately 0.8%, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the Pacific region. The urban population accounts for about 57.4% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city of Funafuti. Tuvalu's population is also characterized by a high population density, with approximately 409 people per square kilometer. The population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to a combination of factors including a relatively high fertility rate and improvements in healthcare.

The population of Tuvalu is also experiencing urbanization, with more people moving to the capital city of Funafuti in search of better economic opportunities and access to services. However, this has also put a strain on the city's infrastructure and resources. Migration patterns in Tuvalu are also influenced by the country's vulnerability to climate change, with some people relocating to other islands or countries in search of safer and more secure living conditions.

Tuvalu's population size and growth trends are also influenced by its limited economic opportunities and lack of resources. The country is heavily reliant on international aid and remittances from Tuvaluan workers abroad, which can make it challenging to sustain a large population. As a result, the government of Tuvalu has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting sustainable development and reducing the country's dependence on external assistance.
