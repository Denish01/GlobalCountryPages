However, the internet is generally reliable, and most users can access basic online services such as email and social media. There is a significant urban vs rural divide in terms of internet access, with the capital Funafuti having better coverage and faster speeds than the outer islands. The reliability of the internet can be affected by weather conditions, such as heavy rainfall or cyclones, which can cause outages and disruptions.\n\nThe Tuvaluan government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the installation of a new submarine fiber-optic cable, which is expected to increase internet speeds and reduce costs. However, the country's remote location and limited resources continue to pose challenges to the development of its internet sector. Despite these challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for many Tuvaluans, particularly in the capital, where it is used for communication, education, and business.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Tuvalu, you can visit the main carriers' offices in Funafuti, which include Tuvalu Telecom, Digicel, and Vodafone. You will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, and you can expect to pay around 20 USD for a tourist SIM card. The SIM card will give you access to the carrier's mobile network, which covers most of the country, although the signal can be weak in some areas. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as some smaller operators may have limited coverage and poor service.\n\nThe main carriers in Tuvalu offer a range of plans and packages, including prepaid and postpaid options, and you can choose the one that best suits your needs. It is a good idea to check the carrier's website or visit their office to get the latest information on plans and prices.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tuvalu Telecom | Prepaid | 1 GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Digicel | Tourist Plan | 2 GB | 20 | Valid for 14 days |\n| Vodafone | Prepaid | 500 MB | 5 | Valid for 3 days |\n| Tuvalu Telecom | Postpaid | 5 GB | 50 | Monthly subscription |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels in Funafuti offering free WiFi to their guests.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is limited, with only a few cafes in Funafuti offering WiFi, and the signal can be weak.\n- Coworking spaces are non-existent in Tuvalu, and remote workers may need to rely on hotel lobbies or cafes to access the internet.\n- Public WiFi is not available in Tuvalu, and users need to rely on mobile networks or private WiFi connections.\n- Some government offices and institutions, such as the University of the South Pacific, may offer free WiFi to students and staff.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are not available in Tuvalu, and remote workers may need to work from hotel lobbies or cafes.\n- Reliable cafe chains, such as the Tuvalu Coffee Shop, may offer a stable internet connection, but the signal can be weak.\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots or satellite internet, may be necessary for remote workers who require a reliable connection.\n- VPNs may be necessary to access certain websites or services that are blocked in Tuvalu, such as Netflix or YouTube.\n- Remote workers may need to plan their work schedule around the internet outages and disruptions that can occur due to weather conditions or maintenance.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major issue in Tuvalu, but some websites may be blocked due to content restrictions.\n- Blocked sites, such as pornographic or gambling websites, may not be accessible in Tuvalu.\n- VPNs, such as ExpressVPN or NordVPN, may be necessary to access certain websites or services that are blocked in Tuvalu.\n- Roaming alternatives, such as purchasing a local SIM card or using a mobile hotspot, may be more cost-effective than relying on international roaming.\n- eSIM options, such as those offered by Google or Apple, may not be available in Tuvalu, and users may need to rely on physical SIM cards.\n- It is a good idea to check the weather forecast before planning any online activities, as heavy rainfall or cyclones can cause internet outages and disruptions.",
