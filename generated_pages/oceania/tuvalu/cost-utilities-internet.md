[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Tuvalu is relatively underdeveloped, with a reliance on diesel generators for electricity and a limited water supply. As a result, utility costs can be high and fluctuating, with prices often increasing during peak demand periods. The Tuvaluan government has implemented measures to improve the energy sector, including the introduction of solar power and energy-efficient technologies, but the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for households and businesses.

The cost of utilities in Tuvalu also varies by season, with higher prices during the dry season (May to October) due to increased demand for electricity and water. During this period, the cost of electricity can increase by up to 20%, while water prices may rise by up to 15%. In contrast, the wet season (November to April) tends to have lower utility costs, with prices decreasing by up to 10% for electricity and 5% for water.
