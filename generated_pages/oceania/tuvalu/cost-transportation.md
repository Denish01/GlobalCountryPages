[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Tuvalu is a small island nation with limited transportation options. The most common mode of transportation is by foot or bicycle, as the distances between villages and towns are relatively short. For longer distances, people rely on **minibuses** or **shared taxis**, which operate on a limited schedule. The quality of public transit is basic, with no **city buses** or **metro/subway** systems available. Most people get around by using the limited public transportation options or by walking.

The lack of a well-developed transportation system in Tuvalu is due to its small size and limited resources. However, the government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of new **minibus** services. Despite these efforts, transportation costs in Tuvalu can still be relatively high, especially for **fuel** and **car rentals**. The cost of **fuel** is around $1.50-$2.50 USD per liter, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.
