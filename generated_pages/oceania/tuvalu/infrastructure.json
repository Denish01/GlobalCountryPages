  "content": "The infrastructure in Tuvalu is relatively underdeveloped, with limited access to modern amenities and services, particularly in rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 45% of population\nInternet Penetration: 14%\nRoad Network: 8 km, poor quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nTuvalu's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with the country facing significant challenges in providing basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation to its population. Recent investments have been made to improve the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the upgrade of existing ones. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to infrastructure services, with the capital city Funafuti having better access to amenities than rural areas. The government of Tuvalu has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on improving the overall quality of life for its citizens.\n\nDespite these efforts, Tuvalu's infrastructure remains vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and flooding, which can have a significant impact on the country's development. The government has been working to build resilience into the country's infrastructure, including the construction of sea walls and the implementation of disaster-risk reduction measures. However, more needs to be done to address the scale and complexity of the challenges facing the country.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure development in Tuvalu is also a major constraint to the country's economic growth and development. The country's limited access to modern amenities and services makes it difficult to attract foreign investment and promote economic development. As a result, the government has been working to prioritize infrastructure development, with a focus on improving the country's transport, energy, and communications systems.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 8 km | Poor | Limited network, mostly unpaved |\n| Railways | 0 km | - | No rail network |\n| Airports | 1 international, 0 domestic | Good | Funafuti International Airport |\n| Ports | 1 major | Moderate | Funafuti Port, limited facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The majority of **electricity generation** in Tuvalu comes from diesel-powered generators, which are expensive and unreliable.\n- The country's **energy sector** is dominated by the state-owned Tuvalu Electricity Corporation, which is responsible for generating and distributing electricity.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are being explored as alternatives to diesel-powered generation, with several small-scale projects already operational.\n- **Power outages** are frequent, particularly during periods of high demand or when diesel supplies are low.\n- The government has been working to improve the **reliability of the energy supply**, including the installation of new generators and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is not always safe to drink, and many households rely on rainwater collection or bottled water for drinking and cooking.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, particularly in rural areas, where many households lack access to proper toilet facilities.\n- **Water access** is a significant challenge in rural areas, where many households rely on wells or springs for their water supply.\n- The government has been working to improve **water and sanitation services**, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.\n- **Waste management** is also a significant challenge, with limited facilities for the disposal of waste and a lack of recycling programs.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile phone coverage** is available in most areas, although the quality of the signal can be poor in some locations.\n- **Internet access** is limited, with only a small percentage of the population having access to the internet.\n- The **4G network** is not yet available in Tuvalu, although there are plans to roll out the service in the near future.\n- **Fiber-optic cables** are being laid to improve internet connectivity and speed.\n- The government has been working to improve **telecommunications services**, including the upgrade of existing infrastructure and the introduction of new technologies.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project** is a major infrastructure project aimed at protecting the country's coastline from the impacts of climate change.\n- The **Funafuti Port Development Project** is a significant investment in the country's transport infrastructure, aimed at improving the facilities and services available at the port.\n- The **Tuvalu Renewable Energy Project** is a major initiative aimed at increasing the country's use of renewable energy sources and reducing its reliance on diesel-powered generation.\n- The **Tuvalu Water and Sanitation Project** is a significant investment in the country's water and sanitation infrastructure, aimed at improving access to safe drinking water and proper toilet facilities.\n- The **Tuvalu Telecommunications Project** is a major initiative aimed at improving the country's telecommunications services, including the rollout of 4G and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.",
