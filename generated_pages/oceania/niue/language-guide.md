[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Niuean is a Polynesian language that is closely related to Tongan and other Pacific languages. The linguistic landscape of Niue is characterized by a high level of bilingualism, with most Niueans speaking both Niuean and English. There are no significant regional dialects in Niue, but the language has undergone changes due to the influence of English and other external factors. English is widely used in government, education, and tourism, and is the primary language used for official purposes. As a result, English is widely understood by the population, particularly among the younger generation and those in the service industry.

The use of Niuean is predominantly reserved for traditional and cultural contexts, such as in church services, traditional ceremonies, and community gatherings. However, efforts are being made to promote the use of Niuean in everyday life and to preserve the language for future generations. Despite the widespread use of English, Niuean remains an important part of Niuean identity and culture, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Niuean are likely to be appreciated by the locals.

The language situation in Niue is characterized by a high level of language contact, with English being the dominant language in many domains. However, Niuean remains the primary language of the home and community, and is an important symbol of Niuean identity and culture. As a result, visitors to Niue can expect to hear both Niuean and English being spoken, and may even encounter some code-switching between the two languages.
