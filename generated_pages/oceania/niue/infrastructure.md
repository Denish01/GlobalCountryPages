[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Niue's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other Pacific Island nations, but recent investments have improved the situation. The country faces significant challenges in maintaining its infrastructure due to its remote location, limited resources, and vulnerability to natural disasters. The urban-rural gap is a significant issue, with the capital Alofi having better access to basic services such as **electricity**, **water**, and **sanitation** compared to rural areas. Despite these challenges, Niue has made significant progress in recent years, with a focus on sustainable development and improving the overall quality of life for its citizens.

The government of Niue, with the support of New Zealand, has implemented various initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a **national infrastructure plan**. This plan aims to address the country's infrastructure needs, including the upgrade of roads, the expansion of **renewable energy** sources, and the improvement of **water** and **sanitation** services. The plan also emphasizes the importance of **disaster risk reduction** and **climate change adaptation**, given Niue's vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change.

Niue's infrastructure development is also influenced by its **economic** situation, with a strong reliance on external aid and a limited **private sector**. The country's economy is primarily driven by **agriculture**, **fishing**, and **tourism**, with a growing focus on **sustainable tourism**. The government is working to diversify the economy and promote **private sector development**, which is expected to have a positive impact on the country's infrastructure development.
