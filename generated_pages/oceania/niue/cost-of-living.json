[/SECTION]\nNiue is considered an expensive destination, with prices comparable to those in New Zealand and other Pacific Island nations. The cost of living in Niue is high due to its remote location, limited economy, and reliance on imports. Compared to its neighbors, Tonga and the Cook Islands, Niue is more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food. However, the island's unique culture, stunning natural beauty, and friendly locals make it a worthwhile destination for those willing to spend a bit more.\n\nThe high cost of living in Niue is also due to the fact that many goods are imported from New Zealand, which increases their price. Additionally, the island's small population and limited economy mean that there is little competition, which can drive up prices. Despite these challenges, Niue offers a unique and unforgettable experience for visitors, with its stunning landscapes, rich culture, and warm hospitality.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-60 | basic rooms with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $100-200 | comfortable rooms with private bathrooms |\n| Luxury/Resort | $250-500 | high-end amenities and stunning views |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $800-1,500 | city center vs outside, with utilities and furniture |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-20 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-40 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $50-100 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $2-5 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $5-10 |\n| Domestic flight | $200-500 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 600 | 1,000 | 1,800 |\n| Food | 500 | 800 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 500 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **1,500** | **2,600** | **4,400** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in a hostel or budget accommodation to save on accommodation costs\n- Eat at local eateries or food stalls, which offer affordable and delicious meals\n- Use public transport or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce transport costs\n- Buy groceries and cook your own meals instead of eating out for every meal\n- Take advantage of free activities such as visiting the local market, exploring the island's natural beauty, and attending cultural events\n- Negotiate prices when shopping at local markets or from street vendors, but be respectful of the local culture and customs\n\nNote: Prices are approximate and can vary depending on the time of year, location, and other factors.
