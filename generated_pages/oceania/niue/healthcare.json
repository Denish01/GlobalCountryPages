  "content": "Healthcare in Niue is a relatively basic system with limited access to specialized care, but the government provides a range of services to its population through a mixed healthcare system.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 999\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nNiue's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the government playing a significant role in delivering healthcare services to its population. The **public healthcare system** provides a range of services, including primary care, maternal and child health, and **dental care**, through a network of clinics and hospitals. However, the quality of care can be limited, and access to specialized care is often restricted. In urban areas, such as the capital **Alofi**, access to healthcare is generally better than in rural areas, where services can be more limited. The Niuean government has made efforts to improve healthcare services, but the system still faces challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals and limited resources.\n\nThe healthcare system in Niue is also influenced by its relationship with **New Zealand**, which provides significant support and funding for healthcare services. This includes the provision of medical supplies, equipment, and personnel, as well as access to specialized care in New Zealand for Niuean patients who require it. Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Niue remains relatively basic, and patients may need to travel to New Zealand or other countries for more complex or specialized care.\n\nThe **private healthcare sector** in Niue is relatively small, with a limited number of private clinics and hospitals. These providers often offer a range of services, including primary care, dental care, and **alternative therapies**, but the quality of care can vary, and costs can be high. Private healthcare providers may also have limited access to specialized care and equipment, which can restrict the range of services they can offer.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Niue Foou Hospital | Alofi | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Alofi Health Centre | Alofi | Public | Primary care, maternal and child health | Yes |\n| Private Clinic | Alofi | Private | Primary care, dental care | Yes |\n| Tamakautoga Health Centre | Tamakautoga | Public | Primary care, maternal and child health | Limited |\n| Hakupu Health Centre | Hakupu | Public | Primary care, maternal and child health | Limited |\n| Lakepa Health Centre | Lakepa | Public | Primary care, maternal and child health | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for visitors to Niue, as it can provide access to medical care and evacuation services in the event of an emergency.\n- **Private health insurance** is also available, but it can be expensive, and coverage may be limited.\n- **Niuean citizens** are entitled to free or low-cost healthcare services through the public healthcare system, but they may still need to pay for some services, such as prescription medications.\n- **Expats** living in Niue may need to purchase private health insurance to access medical care, as they may not be eligible for public healthcare services.\n- **New Zealand citizens** living in Niue may be eligible for public healthcare services, but they should check their eligibility before seeking care.\n- **International health insurance** is also available, which can provide access to medical care and evacuation services in Niue and other countries.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are available at pharmacies and health centers, but the range of medications can be limited.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also available, but the selection can be restricted.\n- **Common brands** of medications may not be available, and generic alternatives may be substituted.\n- **Costs** of medications can be high, especially for specialty or imported medications.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but patients may need to see a doctor or other healthcare provider to obtain a prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** vaccination is recommended for all travelers to Niue, as the disease is prevalent in the Pacific region.\n- **Hepatitis B** vaccination is also recommended, especially for healthcare workers and others who may be at risk of exposure.\n- **Influenza** vaccination is recommended for all travelers, especially during the flu season.\n- **Malaria** is not a significant risk in Niue, but **dengue fever** and other **mosquito-borne illnesses** can occur.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water or eating unpeeled fruits and vegetables.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat or seafood.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Niue, as the country's healthcare system is relatively basic and limited.\n- **Specialized care** is often not available in Niue, and patients may need to travel to New Zealand or other countries for more complex or specialized care.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for some medical procedures, but the range of services is limited, and quality can vary.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are not available in Niue, and patients should exercise caution when seeking medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency services** are available in Niue, but they can be limited, and response times may be slow.\n- **Ambulance services** are available, but they may not be equipped with advanced life support equipment.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be located in Alofi or other urban areas, and patients may need to be transported to these facilities for medical care.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted to the relevant insurance provider, and patients should keep receipts and other documentation to support their claims.\n- **Emergency contact numbers** include the police, ambulance, and hospital, and patients should keep these numbers handy in case of an emergency.",
