  "content": "Food prices in Niue are generally higher than the regional average due to the island's remote location and reliance on imports.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($15-$25 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($40-$60 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($300-$500 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($5-$7 USD)\nCurrency: NZD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nFood prices in Niue are influenced by the island's geographical location and limited access to local produce. The majority of food items are imported from New Zealand, which drives up costs. As a result, eating out can be expensive, and home cooking is a more affordable option for locals and visitors alike. The eating-out culture in Niue is relatively casual, with a focus on local seafood and traditional dishes. However, the limited number of restaurants and cafes means that prices can be higher than in larger cities.\n\nIn comparison to other Pacific Island nations, Niue's food prices are relatively high. This is due to the island's small population and limited economic scale, which makes it difficult to achieve economies of scale in food production and distribution. Despite these challenges, Niue offers a unique and flavorful cuisine that showcases the island's rich cultural heritage. Visitors can expect to pay a premium for high-quality, locally sourced ingredients, but the experience of dining on fresh seafood and traditional Niuean dishes is well worth the cost.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50-$3.50 | 4-5 NZD | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2-$3 | 3-4 NZD | Freshly baked on the island |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $3-$4 | 5-6 NZD | Locally produced |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 3-4 NZD | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8-$10 | 12-15 NZD | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12-$15 | 18-22 NZD | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 8-10 NZD | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3-$5 | 5-7 NZD | Locally produced |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 3-4 NZD | Locally produced |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 2-4 NZD | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10-$12 | 15-18 NZD | Produced on the island |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-$3 | 3-4 NZD | Imported from New Zealand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | Traditional Niuean dishes like **ika mata** (raw fish) and **umu** (earth oven) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$30 | Seafood and international cuisine |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | 3 courses, including local specialties like **coconut crab** |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$100 | Upscale cuisine with a focus on local ingredients |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | **Niuean beer** is a popular choice |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$10 | International brands available |\n| Cappuccino | $4-$6 | Coffee culture is growing in Niue |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | Imported from New Zealand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices at supermarkets and local markets in Niue can vary significantly. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, but they offer a wider range of products, including imported goods. Local markets, on the other hand, specialize in fresh produce, seafood, and traditional Niuean products. Visitors can find better value at local markets, where they can buy fresh fruit, vegetables, and seafood at lower prices. However, the selection may be limited, and the quality can vary.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's essential to know what to buy and where to find the best value.
