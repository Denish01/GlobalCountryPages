[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Niue's healthcare system is primarily public, with the government providing most healthcare services through the Niue Health Department. The quality of public healthcare is generally good, with a range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital care, and specialist consultations. However, the system can be limited in terms of specialized care and equipment, and foreigners may find that private healthcare options are more suited to their needs. For locals, the healthcare system is generally free or low-cost, with most services subsidized by the government. For foreigners, the cost of healthcare can be higher, and it is recommended that they have some form of health insurance to cover their costs.

The healthcare system in Niue is designed to provide comprehensive care to all residents, with a focus on preventive care and public health programs. However, the system can be limited in terms of resources and specialized care, and patients may need to be referred to New Zealand or other countries for more complex treatments. In these cases, the cost of healthcare can be significant, and insurance can help to cover these costs. It is also worth noting that Niue has a **reciprocal healthcare agreement** with New Zealand, which allows Niue residents to access certain healthcare services in New Zealand at no cost or at a reduced cost.
