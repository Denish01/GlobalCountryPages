[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Niue is situated in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 2,400 kilometers northeast of New Zealand. The island is part of the realm of New Zealand, but it is self-governing in free association with New Zealand. Niue is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, with the nearest neighbors being Tonga to the west and the Cook Islands to the northwest. The island's location in the Pacific Ocean makes it prone to tropical storms and cyclones during the summer months. The surrounding ocean is home to a diverse range of marine life, including whales, dolphins, and sea turtles.

The lack of land borders and the island's remote location make Niue a unique and isolated destination. The closest major city is Auckland, New Zealand, which is a three-hour flight away. The island's airport, Hanan International Airport, receives regular flights from New Zealand and other Pacific Island nations. The airport is a key entry point for visitors, who can then explore the island's scenic coastline, coral reefs, and lush forests. The island's capital, Alofi, is located on the western coast and is the center of government, commerce, and tourism.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Niue's terrain is characterized by a raised coral atoll, with a central plateau surrounded by steep cliffs and rocky coastlines. The island's landscape is dominated by limestone formations, which have been shaped by thousands of years of erosion. The terrain is generally rugged, with few beaches and limited areas of flat land. The island's interior is covered in dense forests, which are home to a variety of unique plant and animal species. The forests are also dotted with caves, rock formations, and other geological features that are unique to the island.

The coastline of Niue is marked by steep cliffs, rocky outcrops, and coral reefs. The reefs are home to a diverse range of marine life, including fish, crustaceans, and coral species. The coastline is also dotted with small bays, coves, and beaches, which provide access to the ocean and offer scenic views. The island's terrain and landscape make it an attractive destination for outdoor enthusiasts, who can explore the island's forests, coastlines, and coral reefs. The unique geology of the island also makes it a popular destination for scientists and researchers, who come to study the island's unique formations and species.

The island's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by human activity, with the introduction of non-native species and the development of agriculture and infrastructure. The island's forests have been cleared for agriculture and urban development, which has led to soil erosion and other environmental problems. However, the Niuean government has implemented conservation measures to protect the island's unique environment and ecosystems. These measures include the establishment of national parks and protected areas, as well as initiatives to promote sustainable agriculture and tourism practices.
