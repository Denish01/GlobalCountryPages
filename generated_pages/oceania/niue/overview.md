Niue is a small island territory located in the Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Zealand. It is situated about 2,400 kilometers northeast of Auckland, and is part of the realm of New Zealand. Niue is known for its stunning natural beauty, with a coral reef surrounding the island and a unique landscape of limestone cliffs, caves, and chasms. The territory has a total area of approximately 260 square kilometers and a population of just over 1,600 people, making it one of the smallest countries in the world.

Niue is also a member of several international organizations, including the Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth of Nations.
