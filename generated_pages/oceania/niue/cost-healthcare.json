The quality of public healthcare is generally good, with a range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital care, and specialist consultations. However, the system can be limited in terms of specialized care and equipment, and foreigners may find that private healthcare options are more suited to their needs. For locals, the healthcare system is generally free or low-cost, with most services subsidized by the government. For foreigners, the cost of healthcare can be higher, and it is recommended that they have some form of health insurance to cover their costs.\n\nThe healthcare system in Niue is designed to provide comprehensive care to all residents, with a focus on preventive care and public health programs. However, the system can be limited in terms of resources and specialized care, and patients may need to be referred to New Zealand or other countries for more complex treatments. In these cases, the cost of healthcare can be significant, and insurance can help to cover these costs. It is also worth noting that Niue has a **reciprocal healthcare agreement** with New Zealand, which allows Niue residents to access certain healthcare services in New Zealand at no cost or at a reduced cost.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | 10-20 | 50-100 | Public clinics are available in Alofi and other villages |\n| Specialist Consultation | 20-50 | 100-200 | Specialist services are limited in Niue, and patients may need to travel to New Zealand for more complex care |\n| Dental Checkup | 20-50 | 50-100 | Dental services are available in Alofi, but may be limited in other areas |\n| Eye Exam | 20-50 | 50-100 | Optometry services are available in Alofi, but may be limited in other areas |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | 10-20 | 20-50 | Laboratory services are available in Alofi, but may be limited in other areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | 50-100 | The Niue Hospital in Alofi provides emergency care, but may not have all specialized equipment |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | 100-200 | Hospital stays can be expensive, especially for foreigners without insurance |\n| Basic Surgery | 500-1,000 | Surgical services are available in Niue, but may be limited in terms of specialized care |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | 500-1,000 | Maternity services are available in Niue, but may be limited in terms of specialized care |\n| MRI Scan | 500-1,000 | Imaging services are limited in Niue, and patients may need to travel to New Zealand for more complex tests |\n| X-Ray | 20-50 | X-ray services are available in Niue, but may be limited in terms of specialized equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | 20-50 | Covers public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | 100-200 | Covers private healthcare services, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | 200-500 | Covers healthcare services in Niue and abroad, including emergency medical evacuations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be expensive in Niue, with costs ranging from 10-50 USD per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medication is generally less expensive, with costs ranging from 5-20 USD per item\n- Pharmacy services are available in Alofi, but may be limited in other areas\n- Prescription rules are generally similar to those in New Zealand, with a **prescription required** for most medications\n- Common medications, such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers**, are generally available in Niue, but may be limited in terms of brand options\n- It is recommended that visitors bring any necessary prescription medications with them, as well as a copy of their prescription\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended that you call the local emergency number, 999 or 683 1222, or visit the Niue Hospital in Alofi.
