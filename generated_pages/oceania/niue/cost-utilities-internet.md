[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Niue's utility infrastructure is relatively basic, with a focus on providing essential services such as electricity, water, and waste management. The cost of utilities in Niue can fluctuate due to the island's remote location and reliance on imported fuel. During peak season, which typically runs from June to September, utility costs may increase due to higher demand for electricity and water. However, the Niuean government has implemented measures to stabilize utility prices and promote energy efficiency.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Niue is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, the island's remote location can make it vulnerable to disruptions in utility services. To mitigate this, the government has invested in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the installation of solar panels and wind turbines to reduce the island's reliance on fossil fuels. Despite these efforts, utility costs in Niue can still be relatively high compared to other countries in the region.
