  "content": "The infrastructure in Niue is relatively underdeveloped, with a strong reliance on external support from New Zealand, but recent investments have improved the situation, particularly in the areas of **road maintenance**, **renewable energy**, and **telecommunications**.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 98% of population\nInternet Penetration: 55%\nRoad Network: 120 km, moderate quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nNiue's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other Pacific Island nations, but recent investments have improved the situation. The country faces significant challenges in maintaining its infrastructure due to its remote location, limited resources, and vulnerability to natural disasters. The urban-rural gap is a significant issue, with the capital Alofi having better access to basic services such as **electricity**, **water**, and **sanitation** compared to rural areas. Despite these challenges, Niue has made significant progress in recent years, with a focus on sustainable development and improving the overall quality of life for its citizens.\n\nThe government of Niue, with the support of New Zealand, has implemented various initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a **national infrastructure plan**. This plan aims to address the country's infrastructure needs, including the upgrade of roads, the expansion of **renewable energy** sources, and the improvement of **water** and **sanitation** services. The plan also emphasizes the importance of **disaster risk reduction** and **climate change adaptation**, given Niue's vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change.\n\nNiue's infrastructure development is also influenced by its **economic** situation, with a strong reliance on external aid and a limited **private sector**. The country's economy is primarily driven by **agriculture**, **fishing**, and **tourism**, with a growing focus on **sustainable tourism**. The government is working to diversify the economy and promote **private sector development**, which is expected to have a positive impact on the country's infrastructure development.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 120 km | Moderate | Main roads are sealed, but rural roads are often unsealed and prone to damage during heavy rainfall |\n| Railways | 0 km | - | No railways in Niue |\n| Airports | 1 international | Good | Niue International Airport is the only airport in the country and receives regular flights from New Zealand |\n| Ports | 1 major | Moderate | The port in Alofi is the main entry point for goods and supplies, but it is vulnerable to storms and rough seas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Niue's **power generation** is primarily based on **diesel**, with a growing focus on **renewable energy** sources such as **solar** and **wind**.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing its **renewable energy** capacity, with a target of 50% of electricity generation coming from renewable sources by 2025.\n- **Power outages** are common, particularly during periods of high demand or when there are technical issues with the diesel generators.\n- The government is working to improve the **reliability** of the electricity supply, including the installation of new **energy storage systems**.\n- Niue is also exploring the potential for **geothermal energy**, with a feasibility study currently underway.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally considered safe to drink, but there are concerns about the **water quality** in some areas, particularly during heavy rainfall events.\n- **Sanitation** coverage is relatively high, with most households having access to **septic tanks** or **pit latrines**.\n- **Water access** is a significant issue in rural areas, with some communities relying on **rainwater harvesting** or **springs** for their water supply.\n- The government is working to improve **water** and **sanitation** services, including the development of a **national water policy** and the implementation of **water conservation** measures.\n- **Wastewater management** is also a concern, with a need for improved **wastewater treatment** facilities and **sewerage systems**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively good, with most areas of the country having access to **2G** or **3G** networks.\n- **Fiber optic** cables have been installed, providing **broadband** internet access to many households and businesses.\n- **4G** services are available in some areas, but coverage is limited.\n- The government is working to improve **telecommunications** services, including the rollout of **5G** networks and the expansion of **broadband** access to rural areas.\n- **Postal services** are limited, with mail being transported to and from New Zealand on a regular basis.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Niue National Infrastructure Plan** is a major development project that aims to improve the country's infrastructure, including **roads**, **energy**, **water**, and **sanitation**.\n- The **Renewable Energy Project** is a significant initiative that aims to increase Niue's **renewable energy** capacity and reduce its reliance on **diesel**.\n- The **Alofi Port Development Project** is a major infrastructure project that aims to improve the **port facilities** and increase the country's **trade** and **economic development**.\n- The **Niue Tourism Development Project** is a project that aims to promote **sustainable tourism** and improve the country's **tourism infrastructure**.\n- The **Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Project** is a project that aims to improve Niue's **disaster risk reduction** and **management** capabilities, including the development of **early warning systems** and **emergency response plans**.",
