[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Niue is a small island territory in the Pacific Ocean, with a tropical climate that is characterized by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is the best time to visit Niue, with calm and sunny weather, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and hiking. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by increased rainfall and a higher risk of cyclones, making it less desirable for tourists. The temperature in Niue remains relatively constant throughout the year, ranging from 22 to 28 degrees Celsius, making it a great destination for travelers looking to escape cold winters.

The dry season is the peak tourist season in Niue, with the majority of tourists visiting the island between June and August. During this time, the weather is perfect for outdoor activities, and the island's scenic beauty is at its best. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists visiting the island due to the risk of cyclones and heavy rainfall. However, for travelers on a budget, the wet season can be a great time to visit Niue, with lower prices for accommodations and tour packages.

Niue's climate is also influenced by its location in the Pacific Ocean, with the island experiencing a moderate level of humidity throughout the year. The island's terrain, with its rugged coastline and coral reefs, also plays a significant role in shaping its climate, with the coral reefs helping to protect the island from the open ocean and reducing the risk of erosion.
