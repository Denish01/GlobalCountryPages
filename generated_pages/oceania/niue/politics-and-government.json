The **Premier of Niue** is the head of government, responsible for advising the Governor-General and overseeing the day-to-day administration of the territory. The Niue Assembly, composed of 20 members, is the legislative body, with 6 members elected from the villages and 14 from the common roll. This system provides a high degree of autonomy for Niue, allowing it to manage its internal affairs while maintaining a close relationship with New Zealand.\n\nThe government of Niue is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by the Premier, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration of the territory.

The judicial branch is independent, with the High Court of Niue having jurisdiction over all matters, including constitutional issues.\n\nNiue's political system is characterized by a **unitary** structure, with a single level of government responsible for all aspects of governance. This allows for efficient decision-making and a streamlined administration, but can also limit the representation of different regions and interests.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Cabinet | Premier Dalton Tagelagi | Advises Governor-General, oversees administration |\n| Legislative | Niue Assembly | Speaker of the Assembly | Makes laws, approves budget |\n| Judicial | High Court of Niue | Chief Justice | Interprets laws, resolves disputes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Niue People's Party | Center-right | Young Vivian | 4 | Supports close ties with New Zealand |\n| Niue National Party | Center-left | Toke Talagi | 6 | Advocates for greater autonomy |\n| Independent | - | - | 10 | Non-partisan members |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Niue is based on a **mixed** system, with 6 members elected from the villages and 14 from the common roll.\n- Elections are held every 3 years, with the last election taking place in 2020.\n- The next election is scheduled for 2023.\n- Voter participation is generally high, with over 80% of eligible voters casting ballots in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Niue faces significant **economic challenges**, including a small and isolated economy, limited natural resources, and a high dependence on external aid.\n- The territory is also vulnerable to **climate change**, with rising sea levels and increased storm activity posing a threat to its infrastructure and way of life.\n- Niue has a high **reliance on New Zealand**, which provides significant financial and administrative support, but also limits its autonomy and independence.\n- The territory has a **unique cultural identity**, with a strong emphasis on traditional values and customs, which can sometimes conflict with modernization and development efforts.\n- Niue has a **high level of transparency and accountability**, with a free press and an independent judiciary, which helps to promote good governance and prevent corruption.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Niue is a member of the **United Nations**, the **Commonwealth of Nations**, and the **Pacific Islands Forum**, which provides a platform for regional cooperation and dialogue.\n- The territory has a **close relationship with New Zealand**, which provides significant financial and administrative support, and is also a key partner in regional affairs.\n- Niue has **diplomatic relations** with several countries, including Australia, China, and the United States, which helps to promote trade and investment.\n- The territory is also a member of the **Pacific Islands Development Forum**, which aims to promote sustainable development and regional cooperation in the Pacific.",
