[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Niue has a small, upper-middle-income economy, with a high level of dependence on external aid, particularly from New Zealand. The country's economic development is hindered by its remote location, limited natural resources, and vulnerability to natural disasters. Despite these challenges, Niue has made efforts to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing its tourism sector and providing financial services. The government plays a significant role in the economy, with a large public sector and a range of government-owned enterprises. Niue's economic classification as an upper-middle-income economy reflects its relatively high standard of living, but also highlights the need for continued economic development and diversification.

The country's economic trajectory has been shaped by its historical ties to New Zealand, which has provided significant financial support and guidance. However, Niue has also sought to develop its own economic identity and reduce its reliance on external aid. This has involved investing in infrastructure, promoting private sector development, and exploring new opportunities for economic growth. Despite these efforts, Niue's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks and faces significant challenges in terms of its small size, limited resources, and remote location.

Niue's economy is also characterized by a high level of informality, with many residents engaging in subsistence farming and fishing activities. The government has sought to support these activities through initiatives such as agriculture and fisheries development programs. However, the informal sector also poses challenges for economic development, as it can be difficult to measure and track economic activity outside of the formal sector.
