  "content": "Niue's economy is primarily driven by a mix of government support, tourism, and offshore banking, with a strong reliance on its parent country, New Zealand, for financial assistance and guidance. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($0.015 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($8,938 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Upper-Middle)\nMain Industries: (top 3) Government Services, Tourism, Fishing\nCurrency: NZD\nUnemployment Rate: (approximate 10%)\nEase of Doing Business: (general ranking context: 67 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nNiue has a small, upper-middle-income economy, with a high level of dependence on external aid, particularly from New Zealand. The country's economic development is hindered by its remote location, limited natural resources, and vulnerability to natural disasters. Despite these challenges, Niue has made efforts to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing its tourism sector and providing financial services. The government plays a significant role in the economy, with a large public sector and a range of government-owned enterprises. Niue's economic classification as an upper-middle-income economy reflects its relatively high standard of living, but also highlights the need for continued economic development and diversification.\n\nThe country's economic trajectory has been shaped by its historical ties to New Zealand, which has provided significant financial support and guidance. However, Niue has also sought to develop its own economic identity and reduce its reliance on external aid. This has involved investing in infrastructure, promoting private sector development, and exploring new opportunities for economic growth. Despite these efforts, Niue's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks and faces significant challenges in terms of its small size, limited resources, and remote location.\n\nNiue's economy is also characterized by a high level of informality, with many residents engaging in subsistence farming and fishing activities. The government has sought to support these activities through initiatives such as agriculture and fisheries development programs. However, the informal sector also poses challenges for economic development, as it can be difficult to measure and track economic activity outside of the formal sector.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Government Services | 50% | The public sector is the largest employer in Niue, with a range of government-owned enterprises and agencies |\n| Tourism | 20% | Niue's tourism industry is growing, with a focus on eco-tourism and niche markets such as diving and fishing |\n| Fishing | 10% | Niue has a significant fisheries industry, with a focus on tuna and other pelagic species |\n| Agriculture | 5% | Agriculture is a small but important sector in Niue, with a focus on subsistence farming and copra production |\n| Financial Services | 5% | Niue has a small but growing financial services sector, with a range of offshore banking and financial institutions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Fish and seafood**: Niue's fisheries industry is a significant export earner, with a focus on tuna and other pelagic species\n- **Copra**: Copra is a traditional export commodity for Niue, with a focus on producing high-quality copra for the international market\n- **Horticultural products**: Niue exports a range of horticultural products, including fruits and vegetables, to markets in New Zealand and other Pacific countries\n- **Crafts and handicrafts**: Niue's crafts and handicrafts sector is growing, with a focus on producing high-quality products for the tourism market\n- **Financial services**: Niue's financial services sector is also a significant export earner, with a range of offshore banking and financial institutions\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food and beverages**: Niue imports a significant proportion of its food and beverages, due to the limited availability of local produce\n- **Fuel and petroleum products**: Niue relies on imports of fuel and petroleum products to meet its energy needs\n- **Machinery and equipment**: Niue imports a range of machinery and equipment, including vehicles and construction equipment\n- **Electronics and electrical products**: Niue imports a range of electronics and electrical products, including computers and telecommunications equipment\n- **Pharmaceuticals and medical supplies**: Niue imports pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to meet the needs of its healthcare system\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- New Zealand: New Zealand is Niue's largest trading partner, providing significant financial support and importing a range of Niue's exports\n- Australia: Australia is also an important trading partner for Niue, with a focus on trade in goods and services\n- Fiji: Fiji is a significant trading partner for Niue in the Pacific region, with a focus on trade in goods and services\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Transport networks: Niue has a limited transport network, with a single airport and a range of roads and highways\n- Energy: Niue relies on diesel-generated electricity, with a focus on reducing its reliance on fossil fuels and developing renewable energy sources\n- Internet and mobile penetration: Niue has a relatively high level of internet and mobile penetration, with a focus on developing its telecommunications infrastructure\n- Ports and airports: Niue has a single port and airport, which provide limited connectivity to international markets\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nNiue's economic outlook is positive, with a focus on developing its tourism sector and providing financial services.
