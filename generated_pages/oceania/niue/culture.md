# Niue Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

Niue's culture is a unique blend of Polynesian traditions and modern influences, shaped by its history, language, and geographic location, making it an fascinating destination to explore and experience.

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Niue's culture is defined by its strong Polynesian heritage, with the majority of the population being ethnic Niueans who speak the Niuean language. The country's cultural identity is also influenced by its historical ties to New Zealand, with many Niueans having family connections to New Zealand and speaking English as a second language. The Niuean people are known for their warm hospitality and community-oriented way of life, with a strong emphasis on respect for elders, tradition, and the environment. The country's cultural makeup is also reflected in its traditional arts, music, and dance, which are an integral part of Niuean identity.

The Niuean language is a key aspect of the country's cultural identity, with many locals speaking it as their first language. The language is a Polynesian language, closely related to Tongan and other Pacific languages. English is also widely spoken, particularly in business and tourism, reflecting the country's historical ties to New Zealand. The cultural influences on Niue are also evident in its traditional clothing, with the **tapa cloth** being a significant part of Niuean attire. The tapa cloth is made from the bark of the paper mulberry tree and is worn on special occasions, such as weddings and festivals.

Niue's cultural identity is also shaped by its history, with the country having been a British colony from 1901 to 1903, and then a New Zealand territory from 1903 to the present day. This history has had a significant impact on the country's language, education system, and cultural practices. Despite these external influences, Niue has managed to maintain its unique cultural identity, with a strong emphasis on preserving its traditional practices and customs.
