The linguistic landscape of Niue is characterized by a high level of bilingualism, with most Niueans speaking both Niuean and English. There are no significant regional dialects in Niue, but the language has undergone changes due to the influence of English and other external factors. English is widely used in government, education, and tourism, and is the primary language used for official purposes. As a result, English is widely understood by the population, particularly among the younger generation and those in the service industry.\n\nThe use of Niuean is predominantly reserved for traditional and cultural contexts, such as in church services, traditional ceremonies, and community gatherings. However, efforts are being made to promote the use of Niuean in everyday life and to preserve the language for future generations. Despite the widespread use of English, Niuean remains an important part of Niuean identity and culture, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Niuean are likely to be appreciated by the locals.\n\nThe language situation in Niue is characterized by a high level of language contact, with English being the dominant language in many domains. However, Niuean remains the primary language of the home and community, and is an important symbol of Niuean identity and culture. As a result, visitors to Niue can expect to hear both Niuean and English being spoken, and may even encounter some code-switching between the two languages.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Fakalofa | fah-kah-LOH-fah | formal |\n| Hello | Talofa | tah-LOH-fah | informal |\n| Thank you | Fakafetai | fah-kah-feh-TIE |  |\n| Please | Fakamolemole | fah-kah-moh-leh-MOH-leh |  |\n| Yes / No | Io / Nakai | ee-oh / nah-KYE |  |\n| Excuse me | Tulou | too-LOH |  |\n| How much? | Ko ha palagi? | koh hah pah-LAH-gee |  |\n| Where is...? | Ko fe? | koh feh |  |\n| I don't understand | Nakai kau iloa | nah-KYE kow ee-LOH-ah |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Koe vagahau Pālagi? | koh-eh vah-ngah-HOW pah-LAH-gee |  |\n| Help! | Taukave | tow-kah-VEH |  |\n| Goodbye | Alofa | ah-LOH-fah |  |\n| Sorry | Fakapale | fah-kah-PAH-leh |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Tahi | tah-HEE |\n| 2 | Lua | LOO-ah |\n| 3 | Tolu | toh-LOO |\n| 4 | Fa | fah |\n| 5 | Lima | lee-MAH |\n| 6 | Ono | oh-noh |\n| 7 | Fitu | fee-TOO |\n| 8 | Valu | vah-LOO |\n| 9 | Hiva | hee-vah |\n| 10 | Hogofulu | hoh-ngoh-FOO-loo |\n| 100 | Teau | teh-AH-oo |\n| 1000 | Tausani | tow-sah-NEE |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of traditional Niuean customs and protocols, particularly when interacting with elderly Niueans or in formal settings.\n- Use formal language and titles, such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\", when addressing older Niueans or those in positions of authority.\n- Avoid using slang or colloquialisms, as they may not be widely understood.\n- Be patient and courteous when communicating, as Niueans place a high value on politeness and respect.\n- Use non-verbal communication, such as hand gestures and facial expressions, to supplement your language and show friendliness.\n- Avoid pointing with your feet or touching someone's head, as these are considered rude in Niuean culture.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Niuean, such as \"Fakalofa\" (hello) and \"Fakafetai\" (thank you), to show respect and appreciation for the culture.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication and language barriers.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a language course or attend a cultural workshop to learn more about Niuean language and culture.\n- Ask your hotel or tour operator for assistance with language and communication, as they may have staff who speak Niuean and can provide translation services.\n- Be prepared to use non-verbal communication, such as hand gestures and body language, to supplement your language and show friendliness.",
