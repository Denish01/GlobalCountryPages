The system is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education is compulsory for all children from the age of 5 to 11, and is provided by three primary schools on the island. Secondary education is also compulsory, and is provided by Niue High School, which offers a range of subjects including mathematics, science, English, and social studies. Tertiary education is not available on the island, but students can apply to study at universities in New Zealand or other countries through scholarships or other programs.\n\nThe quality of education in Niue is generally good, with a strong focus on providing students with a well-rounded education that includes academic, vocational, and extracurricular activities. The public education system is free for all citizens, and is funded by the government of Niue. There are no private schools on the island, but some students may choose to attend private schools in New Zealand or other countries.\n\nThe education system in Niue faces some challenges, including limited resources and a lack of specialized teachers in certain subjects. However, the government is working to address these challenges through initiatives such as teacher training programs and the introduction of new technologies to support learning.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\nSince there are no universities in Niue, students typically pursue higher education in New Zealand or other countries.
