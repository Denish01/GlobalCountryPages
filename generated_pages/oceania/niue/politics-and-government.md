[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Niue's political system is based on a **Constitutional Monarchy**, with King Charles III serving as the head of state, represented by the Governor-General of New Zealand. The **Premier of Niue** is the head of government, responsible for advising the Governor-General and overseeing the day-to-day administration of the territory. The Niue Assembly, composed of 20 members, is the legislative body, with 6 members elected from the villages and 14 from the common roll. This system provides a high degree of autonomy for Niue, allowing it to manage its internal affairs while maintaining a close relationship with New Zealand.

The government of Niue is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by the Premier, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration of the territory. The legislative branch is composed of the Niue Assembly, which is responsible for making laws and approving the budget. The judicial branch is independent, with the High Court of Niue having jurisdiction over all matters, including constitutional issues.

Niue's political system is characterized by a **unitary** structure, with a single level of government responsible for all aspects of governance. This allows for efficient decision-making and a streamlined administration, but can also limit the representation of different regions and interests.
