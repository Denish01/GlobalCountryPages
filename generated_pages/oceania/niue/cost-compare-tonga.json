Niue, a territory of New Zealand, has a smaller population and a more limited economy, which can drive up costs for goods and services. Tonga, on the other hand, has a larger population and a more diverse economy, which can lead to lower prices. Overall, Tonga is generally cheaper than Niue, with a cost of living difference of around 20-30% in most categories. This is largely due to Tonga's larger economy and greater competition, which can drive down prices.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Niue's economy is heavily reliant on aid from New Zealand, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services. In contrast, Tonga has a more diversified economy, with a growing tourism sector and a significant agricultural industry. This diversification can help to reduce prices and make Tonga a more affordable option for visitors and residents. Additionally, Tonga's larger population and more developed infrastructure can also contribute to lower costs for transportation, housing, and other essential services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Niue (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 37.5% cheaper in Tonga |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 300 | 40% cheaper in Tonga |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 800 | 33.3% cheaper in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Niue (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33.3% cheaper in Tonga |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 80 | 20% cheaper in Tonga |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 40% cheaper in Tonga |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 33.3% cheaper in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Niue (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper in Tonga |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper in Tonga |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.5 | 1.2 | 20% cheaper in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Niue (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33.3% cheaper in Tonga |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper in Tonga |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Niue (USD) | Tonga (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33.3% savings in Tonga |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% savings in Tonga |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,800 | 30% savings in Tonga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Niue is cheaper for:**\n- High-end dining experiences\n- Luxury accommodations\n- Scuba diving and snorkeling trips\n- **Tonga is cheaper for:**\n- Basic groceries and food staples\n- Public transportation\n- Accommodation options for backpackers and budget travelers\n- Local handicrafts and souvenirs\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Tonga is likely to be the more affordable option, with a lower cost of living and a wider range of accommodation options.
