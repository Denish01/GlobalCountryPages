[SECTION] Overview: Niue vs Tonga [/SECTION]
Niue and Tonga are two island nations in the Pacific, with distinct economic profiles. Niue, a territory of New Zealand, has a smaller population and a more limited economy, which can drive up costs for goods and services. Tonga, on the other hand, has a larger population and a more diverse economy, which can lead to lower prices. Overall, Tonga is generally cheaper than Niue, with a cost of living difference of around 20-30% in most categories. This is largely due to Tonga's larger economy and greater competition, which can drive down prices.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Niue's economy is heavily reliant on aid from New Zealand, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services. In contrast, Tonga has a more diversified economy, with a growing tourism sector and a significant agricultural industry. This diversification can help to reduce prices and make Tonga a more affordable option for visitors and residents. Additionally, Tonga's larger population and more developed infrastructure can also contribute to lower costs for transportation, housing, and other essential services.
