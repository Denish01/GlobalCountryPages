# The Truth About Niue - History & Real Facts

Niue is a small island territory in Oceania with a unique history, culture, and geography that is often misunderstood or overlooked by the general public.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Niue, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand, has a distinct history that dates back to around the 10th century when it was first settled by Polynesian people. The island was discovered by Captain James Cook in 1774, but it wasn't until the mid-19th century that European influence became more prominent. In 1900, Niue became a British protectorate, and in 1901, it was annexed by New Zealand. On October 19, 1974, Niue gained self-government in free association with New Zealand, giving it control over its internal affairs while New Zealand retained responsibility for its defense and foreign affairs.

The early 20th century saw significant changes in Niue's governance structure, with the island becoming a part of the Cook Islands in 1903, only to be separated again in 1904. The Niue Act of 1966 further solidified its relationship with New Zealand, establishing the framework for its current self-governing status. Today, Niue's **parliamentary system** is based on the Westminster model, with a 20-member Assembly elected by the people.

Niue's history is also marked by its efforts to maintain its cultural identity and independence. The island's **traditional customs** and practices continue to play an important role in the lives of its people, with many Niueans still actively participating in **village councils** and **traditional ceremonies**. The country's unique blend of Polynesian and European influences has created a distinct cultural heritage that is worth exploring.

In terms of its relationship with New Zealand, Niue's self-governing status allows it to have a significant degree of autonomy, while still benefiting from New Zealand's support in areas such as defense and foreign affairs. This arrangement has allowed Niue to maintain its independence while still being able to access the resources and expertise of a larger country.
