[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Niue's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the government playing a significant role in delivering healthcare services to its population. The **public healthcare system** provides a range of services, including primary care, maternal and child health, and **dental care**, through a network of clinics and hospitals. However, the quality of care can be limited, and access to specialized care is often restricted. In urban areas, such as the capital **Alofi**, access to healthcare is generally better than in rural areas, where services can be more limited. The Niuean government has made efforts to improve healthcare services, but the system still faces challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals and limited resources.

The healthcare system in Niue is also influenced by its relationship with **New Zealand**, which provides significant support and funding for healthcare services. This includes the provision of medical supplies, equipment, and personnel, as well as access to specialized care in New Zealand for Niuean patients who require it. Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Niue remains relatively basic, and patients may need to travel to New Zealand or other countries for more complex or specialized care.

The **private healthcare sector** in Niue is relatively small, with a limited number of private clinics and hospitals. These providers often offer a range of services, including primary care, dental care, and **alternative therapies**, but the quality of care can vary, and costs can be high. Private healthcare providers may also have limited access to specialized care and equipment, which can restrict the range of services they can offer.
