[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Niue has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from certain countries eligible for visa-free access or able to obtain a visa on arrival.

Citizens from over 60 countries, including those from the European Union, the United States, and Australia, can enter Niue without a visa for a specified period, typically up to 30 days. However, it's essential to note that even if you don't need a visa, you may still require other documents, such as a valid passport and proof of onward travel.
