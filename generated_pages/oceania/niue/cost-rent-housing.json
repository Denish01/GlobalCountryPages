The rental market is mostly driven by the demand from expatriates and tourists, with lease terms typically ranging from six months to two years. Deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent, and tenant rights are protected under New Zealand law, which applies in Niue. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Tonga and the Cook Islands, Niue's housing costs are relatively high, but still affordable for those looking to experience the unique culture and natural beauty of the island.\n\nThe housing market in Niue is also influenced by the island's remote location and limited infrastructure, which can make it challenging to find and maintain housing. However, the Niuean government has been working to improve the island's infrastructure and amenities, which is expected to attract more expatriates and tourists to the island. As a result, the housing market is likely to continue to grow and develop, with more options becoming available for renters and buyers.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | Basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$600 | $250-$450 | Fully furnished, with kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $400-$700 | Family-sized, with separate kitchen and living area |\n| 3 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $600-$1,000 | Spacious, with multiple living areas and outdoor spaces |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$4,000 | Prime locations, with ocean views and modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$3,000 | Residential areas, with easy access to town and amenities |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,000 | Peaceful, natural surroundings, with limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Alofi Village: $400-$700 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, with a range of amenities and services nearby\n- Tamakautoga: $350-$600 per month for a two-bedroom house, with a peaceful and natural setting\n- Avatele: $300-$550 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, with easy access to the beach and outdoor activities\n- Hakupu: $250-$450 per month for a two-bedroom house, with a rural setting and limited amenities\n- Lakepa: $200-$400 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, with a peaceful and natural setting\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Niue [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and prices before arriving on the island, to get an idea of what to expect\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager, to find a suitable and affordable property\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, as this is a common practice in Niue\n- Check the condition and quality of the property, before signing a lease or making a purchase\n- Consider the cost of utilities and other expenses, such as internet and transportation, when budgeting for housing\n- Be aware of scams and fraudulent activities, and always use a secure and reputable payment method when renting or buying a property",
