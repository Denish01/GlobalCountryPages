[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Niue's housing market is relatively small and limited, with a focus on single-family homes and a few apartment buildings. The rental market is mostly driven by the demand from expatriates and tourists, with lease terms typically ranging from six months to two years. Deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent, and tenant rights are protected under New Zealand law, which applies in Niue. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Tonga and the Cook Islands, Niue's housing costs are relatively high, but still affordable for those looking to experience the unique culture and natural beauty of the island.

The housing market in Niue is also influenced by the island's remote location and limited infrastructure, which can make it challenging to find and maintain housing. However, the Niuean government has been working to improve the island's infrastructure and amenities, which is expected to attract more expatriates and tourists to the island. As a result, the housing market is likely to continue to grow and develop, with more options becoming available for renters and buyers.
