The cost of utilities in Niue can fluctuate due to the island's remote location and reliance on imported fuel. During peak season, which typically runs from June to September, utility costs may increase due to higher demand for electricity and water. However, the Niuean government has implemented measures to stabilize utility prices and promote energy efficiency.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Niue is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, the island's remote location can make it vulnerable to disruptions in utility services. To mitigate this, the government has invested in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the installation of solar panels and wind turbines to reduce the island's reliance on fossil fuels. Despite these efforts, utility costs in Niue can still be relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | Not applicable |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | Included in council rates |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$165** | **$210** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 30 Mbps | Telecom Niue, Kacific |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 100 Mbps | Telecom Niue, Kacific |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Telecom Niue |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-50 | 10-20 GB | Telecom Niue |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-120 | varies | Telecom Niue, Kacific |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | Available through international subscription |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | Available through international subscription |\n| Local Streaming | $0 | Limited local content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Niue, contact the relevant service provider, such as Telecom Niue for internet and phone services, and the Niue Power Corporation for electricity.\n- Consider using prepaid electricity options to avoid high bills, especially during peak season.\n- Choose internet providers that offer reliable and fast speeds, such as Telecom Niue or Kacific.\n- Take advantage of energy-efficient appliances and lighting to reduce electricity costs.\n- Be aware of seasonal variations in utility costs and plan accordingly to avoid high bills.",
