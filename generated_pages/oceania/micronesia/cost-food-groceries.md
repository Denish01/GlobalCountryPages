# Food & Grocery Prices in Micronesia

[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Micronesia are higher than the regional average due to the country's geographical location and limited access to local produce. The cost of living in Micronesia is driven up by the high cost of importing goods, including food, which can be up to 50% more expensive than in neighboring countries. As a result, eating out can be a significant expense, with prices ranging from $15 USD for a meal at an inexpensive restaurant to $40 USD for a meal for two at a mid-range restaurant. However, home cooking is a more affordable option, with a monthly grocery budget for one person ranging from $200 to $300 USD.

The eating-out culture in Micronesia is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home due to the high cost of dining out. However, there are still many restaurants and eateries available, particularly in the capital city of Palikir, offering a range of local and international cuisine. The high cost of food in Micronesia is also driven by the limited availability of local produce, with many staple foods such as rice, flour, and sugar being imported from other countries.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Micronesia can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices up to 20% higher than at local markets. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and may have better quality control. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional Micronesian products at lower prices. It's recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while shopping for imported goods and staples at supermarkets.

When shopping at local markets, it's essential to be aware of the **bargaining norms**, as prices may not be fixed. Vendors may be willing to negotiate prices, particularly for bulk purchases. It's also important to note that local markets may not always have the same range of products as supermarkets, and the quality of goods may vary. However, shopping at local markets can be a great way to experience the local culture and support the local economy.
