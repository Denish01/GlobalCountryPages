[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet quality in Micronesia is relatively poor, with average download speeds of 5 Mbps, which can make it difficult to stream videos or access large files. The urban areas, such as the capital city Palikir, tend to have better internet connectivity than the rural areas, where the infrastructure is often limited. The reliability of the internet can also be a issue, with frequent outages and disconnections, especially during bad weather. Despite these challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for the people of Micronesia, with many using it for communication, education, and business.

The internet infrastructure in Micronesia is still in the process of development, with many areas still lacking access to high-speed internet. The government and private companies are working to improve the internet connectivity, but it will likely take some time before the internet quality improves significantly. In the meantime, tourists and travelers can still access the internet through mobile networks and WiFi hotspots, although the speeds and coverage may be limited. It's also worth noting that the internet censorship is relatively low in Micronesia, with most websites and online services available without restrictions.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Micronesia, tourists and travelers can visit one of the main carriers, such as FSM Telecom or Marshalls Telecom, and purchase a prepaid SIM card. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 20 USD, and it usually comes with a certain amount of data and voice minutes. To purchase a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and fill out a registration form. The recommended carriers for tourists are FSM Telecom and Marshalls Telecom, as they offer a range of prepaid plans and have relatively good coverage.

For example, a 1GB data plan can cost around 10 USD, while a 5GB data plan can cost around 30 USD.
