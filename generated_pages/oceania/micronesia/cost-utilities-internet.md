[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Micronesia is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. However, the government has been working to improve the infrastructure, with investments in renewable energy and water management systems. The costs of utilities in Micronesia can be fluctuating, with seasonal variations in demand and supply affecting prices. For example, during the dry season, water prices may increase due to limited supply, while electricity prices may decrease during the wet season when hydroelectric power is more abundant.

The overall cost of living in Micronesia is relatively high, with a GDP per capita PPP of $4,347, which can make utility costs a significant burden for some households. However, the government has implemented measures to subsidize utility costs for low-income households, and some providers offer prepaid plans that can help households manage their expenses. The inflation rate of 5.4% in 2022 has also affected utility prices, with some providers increasing their rates to keep up with rising costs.
