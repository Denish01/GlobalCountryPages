The public healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which operates hospitals and clinics throughout the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly, with urban areas generally having better access to healthcare services than rural areas. The public healthcare system provides basic medical care, including primary care, maternal and child health services, and some specialized services. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer more specialized services, including surgical procedures and diagnostic testing.\n\nThe quality of care in Micronesia is generally considered to be basic, with some challenges in accessing specialized services. There is a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas, and medical equipment and supplies can be limited. Additionally, the country's remote location and lack of connectivity can make it difficult to access emergency medical services. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new medical equipment and training healthcare professionals.\n\nHealthcare access is a significant issue in Micronesia, particularly in rural areas. Many people in rural areas rely on traditional medicine and may not have access to modern healthcare services. The government has implemented programs to improve healthcare access in rural areas, including the deployment of community health workers and the establishment of rural health clinics. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access between urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yap State Hospital | Colonia, Yap | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Chuuk State Hospital | Weno, Chuuk | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Kosrae State Hospital | Tofol, Kosrae | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Pohnpei State Hospital | Kolonia, Pohnpei | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Private Medical Clinic | Kolonia, Pohnpei | Private | General medicine, surgery, dental care | Yes |\n| Yap Private Clinic | Colonia, Yap | Private | General medicine, dental care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expatriates, as it can provide access to better quality care and more specialized services.\n- Local health insurance options are available, but they may not provide the same level of coverage as international health insurance plans.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** plans are available and can provide coverage for medical evacuation, hospitalization, and other medical expenses.\n- The cost of health insurance in Micronesia can vary depending on the provider and the level of coverage.\n- It is recommended that visitors and expatriates research and purchase health insurance before arriving in the country.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but it is not always comprehensive.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are available at pharmacies and hospitals, but the selection can be limited, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Prescription medications** may require a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider, and some medications may not be available in the country.\n- Common brands of medications are available, but **generic medications** may be more widely available.\n- The cost of medications can vary depending on the type and brand, but they are generally more expensive than in other countries.\n- It is recommended that visitors and expatriates bring any necessary medications with them when traveling to Micronesia.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Micronesia.\n- **Typhoid** vaccination is also recommended, particularly for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of the country, and **insecticide-treated bed nets** and **insect repellent** are recommended.\n- **Dengue fever** and **zika virus** are also present in the country, and **mosquito-borne illness prevention** measures are recommended.\n- **Water-borne illnesses** can be a risk, particularly in rural areas, and **water purification tablets** or **filtered water** are recommended.\n- **Food-borne illnesses** can also be a risk, and **food safety precautions** are recommended.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Micronesia is not a major destination for medical tourism, but some **specialized medical procedures** may be available at private hospitals and clinics.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are available, but they may not meet the same standards as hospitals in other countries.\n- The cost of medical procedures can vary depending on the provider and the procedure, but **cost savings** may be available for some procedures.\n- It is recommended that medical tourists research and carefully evaluate the quality of care and the qualifications of healthcare providers before seeking medical care in Micronesia.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a medical emergency, call **911** or contact the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance services** are available, but they may not be reliable or equipped with the same level of medical equipment as ambulances in other countries.\n- The nearest hospital may not always have the necessary medical equipment or specialized care, and **medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases.\n- It is recommended that visitors and expatriates have a plan in place for emergency medical situations, including **health insurance** and **emergency contact information**.\n- In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended that visitors and expatriates contact their **health insurance provider** or **embassy** for assistance.",
