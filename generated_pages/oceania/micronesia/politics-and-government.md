[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Micronesia is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by the president, who is both the head of state and the head of government. The president is elected by the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia, the unicameral legislature, for a four-year term. The president appoints the vice president and cabinet members, who are responsible for the administration of the government. The legislative branch is composed of 14 members, who are elected by the people for a two-year term. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court, which has the final say on matters of law and the constitution.

The government of Micronesia is a federal system, with four states: Yap, Chuuk, Kosrae, and Pohnpei. Each state has its own government and a significant degree of autonomy. The federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and national security, while the state governments are responsible for matters such as education, health, and infrastructure. The system of government is designed to promote **separation of powers**, with each branch having checks and balances on the other two branches.
