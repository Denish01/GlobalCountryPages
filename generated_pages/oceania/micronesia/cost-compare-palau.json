Micronesia has a lower cost of living, with prices for everyday items such as food, housing, and transportation being relatively affordable. The country's economy is largely driven by agriculture, fishing, and tourism, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Palau has a more developed economy, with a strong focus on tourism and a higher standard of living, which drives up prices for goods and services.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living.
