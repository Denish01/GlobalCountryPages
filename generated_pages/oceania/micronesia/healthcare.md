[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Micronesia is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering services. The public healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which operates hospitals and clinics throughout the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly, with urban areas generally having better access to healthcare services than rural areas. The public healthcare system provides basic medical care, including primary care, maternal and child health services, and some specialized services. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer more specialized services, including surgical procedures and diagnostic testing.

The quality of care in Micronesia is generally considered to be basic, with some challenges in accessing specialized services. There is a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas, and medical equipment and supplies can be limited. Additionally, the country's remote location and lack of connectivity can make it difficult to access emergency medical services. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new medical equipment and training healthcare professionals.

Healthcare access is a significant issue in Micronesia, particularly in rural areas. Many people in rural areas rely on traditional medicine and may not have access to modern healthcare services. The government has implemented programs to improve healthcare access in rural areas, including the deployment of community health workers and the establishment of rural health clinics. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare access between urban and rural areas.
