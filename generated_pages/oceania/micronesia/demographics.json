The population growth rate is around 0.8%, which is lower than the average for many Pacific Island nations. The country's population is spread across a total area of 702 square kilometers, resulting in a population density of approximately 150 people per square kilometer. Urbanization is a growing trend in Micronesia, with around 22.5% of the population living in urban areas. The majority of the population resides in rural areas, with many people engaged in subsistence farming and fishing.\n\nThe population of Micronesia has been growing steadily over the years, although at a slow rate. The country's population is expected to continue growing, driven by a relatively high total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman. However, the population growth rate is also influenced by migration patterns, with many Micronesians migrating to other countries in search of better economic opportunities. The government of Micronesia has been working to address the challenges posed by population growth, including the need for improved healthcare, education, and infrastructure.\n\nThe median age in Micronesia is around 23.5 years, indicating a relatively young population. This has implications for the country's workforce and economy, as a large proportion of the population is in the working-age group. However, the country also faces challenges related to youth unemployment and the need for skills development. The government has been working to address these challenges through initiatives such as vocational training programs and support for entrepreneurship.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chuukese | 49% | Chuuk State | Largest ethnic group in Micronesia |\n| Kosraeans | 14% | Kosrae State | Known for their traditional dancing and music |\n| Pohnpeians | 24% | Pohnpei State | Skilled craftsmen and farmers |\n| Yapese | 10% | Yap State | Traditionally a matrilineal society |\n| Outer Islanders | 3% | Outer Islands | Diverse group of smaller islands and atolls |\n[/TABLE]\nThe population of Micronesia is ethnically diverse, with a range of different groups each with their own distinct culture and traditions.
