These airports receive direct flights from neighboring countries, including Guam, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. The most convenient way to reach Micronesia is by flying into one of these airports, as there are no overland entry points due to the country's island geography. \n\nThe main hubs for direct flights to Micronesia include Guam, which is served by several airlines, including United Airlines and Japan Airlines. You can also fly into Micronesia from Palau and the Marshall Islands, although these routes may be less frequent. It's essential to book your flights well in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and the best prices.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic flights are the most convenient way to travel between the different states of Micronesia.
