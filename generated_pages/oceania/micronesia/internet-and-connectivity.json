  "content": "The internet in Micronesia is generally limited, with slow speeds and poor coverage, especially in rural areas, but tourists and travelers can still access the internet through mobile networks and WiFi hotspots. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: FSM Telecom, Marshalls Telecom, Palau Telecom\nSIM Card Cost: 20 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet quality in Micronesia is relatively poor, with average download speeds of 5 Mbps, which can make it difficult to stream videos or access large files. The urban areas, such as the capital city Palikir, tend to have better internet connectivity than the rural areas, where the infrastructure is often limited. The reliability of the internet can also be a issue, with frequent outages and disconnections, especially during bad weather. Despite these challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for the people of Micronesia, with many using it for communication, education, and business.\n\nThe internet infrastructure in Micronesia is still in the process of development, with many areas still lacking access to high-speed internet. The government and private companies are working to improve the internet connectivity, but it will likely take some time before the internet quality improves significantly. In the meantime, tourists and travelers can still access the internet through mobile networks and WiFi hotspots, although the speeds and coverage may be limited. It's also worth noting that the internet censorship is relatively low in Micronesia, with most websites and online services available without restrictions.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Micronesia, tourists and travelers can visit one of the main carriers, such as FSM Telecom or Marshalls Telecom, and purchase a prepaid SIM card. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 20 USD, and it usually comes with a certain amount of data and voice minutes. To purchase a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and fill out a registration form. The recommended carriers for tourists are FSM Telecom and Marshalls Telecom, as they offer a range of prepaid plans and have relatively good coverage.\n\nThe data plans offered by the carriers in Micronesia vary in price and data allowance, but most of them are relatively affordable. For example, a 1GB data plan can cost around 10 USD, while a 5GB data plan can cost around 30 USD. It's worth noting that the data speeds can be slow, especially in rural areas, so it's best to choose a plan that suits your needs and budget.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FSM Telecom | Tourist Plan | 1GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Marshalls Telecom | Data Plan | 5GB | 30 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Palau Telecom | Prepaid Plan | 2GB | 20 | Valid for 14 days |\n| FSM Telecom | Voice and Data | 500MB | 15 | Includes 100 voice minutes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality in Micronesia is generally good, with most hotels offering free WiFi to their guests.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not very common in Micronesia, but some cafes and restaurants in the capital city Palikir offer free WiFi to their customers.\n- Coworking spaces are limited in Micronesia, but some offices and business centers offer shared workspaces with WiFi.\n- Public WiFi is not widely available in Micronesia, but some public areas such as airports and seaports offer free WiFi.\n- Some restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi to their customers, especially in the tourist areas.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces in Micronesia are limited, but some offices and business centers offer shared workspaces with WiFi and other amenities.\n- Reliable cafe chains with WiFi are not very common in Micronesia, but some cafes and restaurants in the capital city Palikir offer free WiFi to their customers.\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots or satellite internet, are available in Micronesia, but they can be expensive and have limited coverage.\n- VPN needs are relatively low in Micronesia, as the internet censorship is relatively low, but it's still recommended to use a VPN when accessing sensitive information online.\n- Some hotels and resorts also offer coworking spaces and meeting rooms with WiFi and other amenities, which can be useful for remote workers.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship in Micronesia is relatively low, but some websites and online services may be blocked or restricted.\n- Blocked sites in Micronesia include some torrent and file-sharing websites, as well as some online gambling sites.\n- VPN recommendations for Micronesia include ExpressVPN and NordVPN, which offer reliable and secure connections.\n- Roaming alternatives, such as purchasing a local SIM card or using a mobile hotspot, can be more cost-effective than roaming with your home carrier.\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Micronesia, but some carriers offer eSIM plans for tourists and travelers.\n- It's also worth noting that the internet infrastructure in Micronesia can be vulnerable to natural disasters, such as typhoons and earthquakes, which can cause outages and disruptions.",
