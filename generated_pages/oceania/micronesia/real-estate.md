[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Micronesia is relatively small and undeveloped, with a limited number of properties available for sale or rent. The market is primarily driven by the local population, with some demand from foreign investors and **expatriates**. The current market conditions are stable, with a slow but steady increase in prices over the past few years. The price trajectory is expected to continue to rise, driven by the growing economy and increasing demand for housing. Urban areas such as Palikir and Weno tend to have higher prices and more **luxury properties**, while rural areas are generally more affordable.

The Micronesian government has implemented various initiatives to promote the development of the property market, including the creation of a **land registry** and the introduction of new **property laws**. These initiatives aim to provide a more transparent and secure environment for property owners and investors. However, the market still faces some challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and limited access to **financing options**.

The demand for rental properties is high, particularly in urban areas, due to the limited number of properties available for sale. This has driven up rental prices, making it a **lucrative market** for property owners. However, the rental market is largely unregulated, and **tenant rights** are not well protected. As a result, it is essential for property owners and tenants to have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations.
