        <h2>How Micronesia Is Divided</h2>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Micronesia has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with domestic flights connecting the major islands and states. The country also has a network of buses and taxis, although these may be limited in rural areas. Driving conditions can be challenging, particularly on the outer islands, due to rough roads and limited infrastructure. However, the scenic beauty of the islands and the opportunity to experience traditional Micronesian culture make the journey well worth it.</p>
        <p>Domestic flights are the fastest and most convenient way to travel between the major islands and states, with several airlines operating regular services. However, flights may be limited, and it is recommended to book in advance to avoid disappointment. Buses and taxis are also available, although these may be more expensive and less convenient than flying. For visitors who prefer to drive, car rental services are available, although driving conditions can be challenging, particularly on the outer islands. [CALLOUT] It is recommended to exercise caution when driving in Micronesia, particularly at night or in rural areas, due to limited lighting and road conditions.</p>
