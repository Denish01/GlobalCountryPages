[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Micronesia is relatively small and limited, with a high demand for housing, particularly in the capital city of Palikir. Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under Micronesian law, but the enforcement of these rights can be inconsistent. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Palau and the Marshall Islands, Micronesia's housing costs are relatively high, due in part to the country's remote location and limited infrastructure. However, the cost of living in Micronesia is still lower than in many other Pacific Island nations.

The housing market in Micronesia is also influenced by the country's economy, which is heavily reliant on foreign aid and fishing revenues. The government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the development of new housing projects and the provision of subsidies for low-income families. However, the housing market remains relatively underdeveloped, with a lack of affordable housing options and limited access to financing for homebuyers. As a result, many Micronesians rely on traditional housing, such as family homes and communal living arrangements.
