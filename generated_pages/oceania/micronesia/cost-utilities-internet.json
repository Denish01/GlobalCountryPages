  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Micronesia can range from $150 to $300 per month for a medium-sized apartment, with internet prices starting at around $50 per month for a 60 Mbps connection.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($50 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($30 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.35 per kWh)\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Micronesia is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. However, the government has been working to improve the infrastructure, with investments in renewable energy and water management systems. The costs of utilities in Micronesia can be fluctuating, with seasonal variations in demand and supply affecting prices. For example, during the dry season, water prices may increase due to limited supply, while electricity prices may decrease during the wet season when hydroelectric power is more abundant.\n\nThe overall cost of living in Micronesia is relatively high, with a GDP per capita PPP of $4,347, which can make utility costs a significant burden for some households. However, the government has implemented measures to subsidize utility costs for low-income households, and some providers offer prepaid plans that can help households manage their expenses. The inflation rate of 5.4% in 2022 has also affected utility prices, with some providers increasing their rates to keep up with rising costs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | (propane or diesel-powered generators) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in municipal fees) |\n| **Total** | **$140** | **$215** | **$310** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-$60 | 10-20 Mbps | FSM Telecom, Micronesian Telecom |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-$100 | 60-100 Mbps | FSM Telecom, Micronesian Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $20-$30 | 5-10 GB | FSM Telecom, Micronesian Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $50-$70 | 10-20 GB | FSM Telecom, Micronesian Telecom |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $100-$150 | varies | FSM Telecom, Micronesian Telecom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | (available with international subscription) |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | (available with international subscription) |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited content available) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, contact the local providers (FSM Telecom, Micronesian Telecom) and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Consider prepaid plans for electricity and mobile data to manage expenses and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Choose the best internet provider based on coverage and speed, with FSM Telecom and Micronesian Telecom being the main providers.\n- Save on bills by using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and bundling services.\n- Be aware of seasonal variations in utility prices and plan accordingly to avoid unexpected increases in costs.",
