  "content": "The cost of education in Micronesia varies depending on the type of institution and the level of education, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private and international schools can range from a few thousand to over $10,000 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 11.6%\nLiteracy Rate: 89%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Micronesia is overseen by the national government, with a focus on providing free or subsidized education to all citizens. Public schools are generally considered to be of good quality, with English being the primary language of instruction. The compulsory education years are from grade 1 to grade 12, with students typically starting school at the age of 6. Private schools, on the other hand, offer an alternative to public education, with some schools catering to the children of expatriates and wealthy locals. International schools are also available, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the American curriculum.\n\nThe quality of education in Micronesia is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy skills. However, there are some challenges facing the education system, including a shortage of qualified teachers and a lack of resources in some schools. Despite these challenges, Micronesia has made significant progress in improving its education system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to education and improving the quality of teaching.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Good quality, English language instruction |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Range of quality, some schools offer specialized programs |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Good quality, English language instruction |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of quality, some schools offer specialized programs |\n| International School | $8,000-$12,000 | IB and American curriculum, high quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $2,000-$4,000 | $4,000-$6,000 | College of Micronesia, limited programs |\n| Private University | $4,000-$6,000 | $6,000-$8,000 | Limited options, some online programs |\n| Top-Ranked University | $6,000-$8,000 | $8,000-$10,000 | Limited options, some online programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Limited options, mostly in urban areas |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Limited availability, mostly in urban areas |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Limited options, mostly in urban areas |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, some schools may require additional materials |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools, cost varies depending on school |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **College of Micronesia** is the main public university in Micronesia, offering a range of programs including business, education, and health sciences.\n- **Scholarships** are available for Micronesian students to study abroad, with some programs offering full tuition and living expenses.\n- **Online learning** options are limited in Micronesia, but some universities offer online programs for students who cannot attend classes in person.\n- The **education quality** in Micronesia is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy skills.\n- **International schools** are a good option for expatriates and those looking for a high-quality education, with some schools offering specialized programs such as the IB curriculum.\n- **Language courses** are available for those looking to learn Micronesian languages such as Chuukese and Kosraean, with some courses offering cultural immersion programs.",
