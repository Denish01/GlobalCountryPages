[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Micronesia has a tropical marine climate, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The country experiences a dry season from December to June, with average temperatures ranging from 77°F to 88°F (25°C to 31°C), and a wet season from July to November, with average temperatures ranging from 82°F to 90°F (28°C to 32°C). The dry season is the best time to visit Micronesia, as it offers calm seas, clear skies, and comfortable temperatures, making it perfect for outdoor activities like diving, snorkeling, and exploring the islands. The wet season, on the other hand, brings heavy rainfall, strong winds, and potential typhoons, which can disrupt travel plans and make it difficult to engage in outdoor activities.

The climate in Micronesia is influenced by its location in the Pacific Ocean, with the trade winds and the **Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)** playing a significant role in shaping the country's weather patterns. The ITCZ is a belt of low-pressure systems that encircles the earth near the equator, bringing warm, moist air from the tropics. During the dry season, the ITCZ is located south of Micronesia, resulting in a dry and stable atmosphere, while during the wet season, it is located north of the country, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds.

The seasons in Micronesia have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, the weather is perfect for outdoor activities, and the islands are bustling with tourists. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices for accommodations and tours. However, some tourists prefer to visit during the wet season, as it offers a more relaxed atmosphere and a chance to experience the local culture without the crowds.
