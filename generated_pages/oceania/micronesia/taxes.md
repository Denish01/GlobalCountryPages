[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
The tax system in Micronesia is based on a **territorial taxation** principle, where only income derived from sources within the country is subject to tax. This means that individuals and businesses are only taxed on their income earned within Micronesia, and not on their worldwide income. To be considered a tax resident in Micronesia, an individual must have a permanent home in the country, or be physically present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year. Companies are considered tax residents if they are incorporated in Micronesia or have their management and control in the country.

The tax system in Micronesia is relatively simple, with a focus on **income tax** and **corporate tax**. There are no **wealth taxes**, **inheritance taxes**, or **gift taxes** in the country. The tax authority in Micronesia is responsible for administering and enforcing the tax laws, and provides guidance and support to taxpayers through its website and offices.
