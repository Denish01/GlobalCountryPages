[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Micronesia is relatively small, with a total of approximately 105,564 people, according to the latest available estimates.

The majority of the population resides in rural areas, with many people engaged in subsistence farming and fishing.

The population of Micronesia has been growing steadily over the years, although at a slow rate. The country's population is expected to continue growing, driven by a relatively high total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman. However, the population growth rate is also influenced by migration patterns, with many Micronesians migrating to other countries in search of better economic opportunities. The government of Micronesia has been working to address the challenges posed by population growth, including the need for improved healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

The median age in Micronesia is around 23.5 years, indicating a relatively young population. This has implications for the country's workforce and economy, as a large proportion of the population is in the working-age group. However, the country also faces challenges related to youth unemployment and the need for skills development. The government has been working to address these challenges through initiatives such as vocational training programs and support for entrepreneurship.
