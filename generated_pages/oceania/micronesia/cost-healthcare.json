  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Micronesia can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private healthcare services, with public services generally being more affordable but often having longer wait times and less availability of specialized care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $508 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 2.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMicronesia has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, but often has longer wait times and less availability of specialized care. Locals typically rely on the public system, while foreigners and those with the means often opt for private care. The system is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, which is responsible for setting healthcare policies and regulating healthcare providers. While healthcare is generally available, the quality and availability of services can vary significantly depending on the location, with more rural areas often having limited access to specialized care.\n\nThe need for insurance in Micronesia is recommended, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially for specialized care. While the public system is generally more affordable, it may not always be able to provide the level of care needed, especially for serious or complex conditions. Private insurance can help to fill this gap, providing access to higher-quality care and more specialized services. However, the cost of insurance can be high, and many locals may not be able to afford it. As a result, many people in Micronesia rely on out-of-pocket payments for healthcare, which can be a significant burden for those with limited financial resources.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist care, advanced procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, comprehensive medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, with prices ranging from $5-$20 per item.\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not always have the latest or most advanced medications.\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with many medications requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Some medications may be available at a lower cost through government-subsidized programs.\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration dates and authenticity of medications before purchasing.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or visit the nearest hospital. The Yap State Hospital and the Chuuk State Hospital are two of the best-equipped hospitals in the country, with a range of services and specialized care available. However, emergency services can be limited in more rural areas, and medical evacuation to a larger hospital or to another country may be necessary in serious cases. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of transportation available. Additionally, it is a good idea to research the local emergency services and healthcare options before traveling to Micronesia, and to consider purchasing travel insurance that covers medical emergencies.",
