Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under Micronesian law, but the enforcement of these rights can be inconsistent. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Palau and the Marshall Islands, Micronesia's housing costs are relatively high, due in part to the country's remote location and limited infrastructure. However, the cost of living in Micronesia is still lower than in many other Pacific Island nations.\n\nThe housing market in Micronesia is also influenced by the country's economy, which is heavily reliant on foreign aid and fishing revenues. The government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the development of new housing projects and the provision of subsidies for low-income families. However, the housing market remains relatively underdeveloped, with a lack of affordable housing options and limited access to financing for homebuyers. As a result, many Micronesians rely on traditional housing, such as family homes and communal living arrangements.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $400-$600 | $200-$400 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$800 | $300-$600 | standard amenities, separate kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $500-$900 | family-sized, additional amenities such as air conditioning and washing machine |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,500 | $700-$1,200 | spacious, high-end amenities such as private balcony and ocean views |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, close to government offices and amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, with access to schools and shopping centers |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | rural areas, with limited access to amenities and services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Kolonia: $800-$1,200 per month, a popular neighborhood for expats, with access to amenities such as restaurants and shops\n- Palikir: $600-$1,000 per month, the capital city, with a range of housing options and access to government offices and services\n- Weno: $500-$900 per month, a coastal neighborhood, with stunning ocean views and a relaxed atmosphere\n- Net: $400-$800 per month, a rural neighborhood, with limited access to amenities, but a peaceful and natural environment\n- Madolenihmw: $300-$600 per month, a rural neighborhood, with limited access to amenities, but a strong sense of community and traditional culture\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Micronesia [/SECTION]\n- Research thoroughly: it's essential to research the local market and understand the prices and conditions of different neighborhoods and housing options\n- Work with a reputable agent: using a reputable real estate agent can help you find a suitable property and navigate the rental process\n- Inspect the property: before signing a lease, inspect the property carefully to ensure it is in good condition and meets your needs\n- Negotiate the rent: it's common to negotiate the rent in Micronesia, so be prepared to make an offer and negotiate the terms of the lease\n- Understand the lease: make sure you understand the terms of the lease, including the length of the lease, the rent, and any additional costs or responsibilities\n- Be prepared for power outages: Micronesia is prone to power outages, so it's essential to be prepared and have a plan in place for alternative lighting and communication.",
