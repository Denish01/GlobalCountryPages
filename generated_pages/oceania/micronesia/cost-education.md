[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Micronesia is overseen by the national government, with a focus on providing free or subsidized education to all citizens. Public schools are generally considered to be of good quality, with English being the primary language of instruction. The compulsory education years are from grade 1 to grade 12, with students typically starting school at the age of 6. Private schools, on the other hand, offer an alternative to public education, with some schools catering to the children of expatriates and wealthy locals. International schools are also available, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the American curriculum.

The quality of education in Micronesia is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy skills. However, there are some challenges facing the education system, including a shortage of qualified teachers and a lack of resources in some schools. Despite these challenges, Micronesia has made significant progress in improving its education system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to education and improving the quality of teaching.
