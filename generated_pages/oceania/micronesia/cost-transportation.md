[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Micronesia is an archipelago with limited transportation options, and most people rely on **private vehicles** or **taxis** to get around. The country has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with few buses and no trains. However, the main islands have a network of paved roads, making it possible to travel by car or taxi. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with the capital Palikir having a more developed system than the outer islands.

The main transportation modes in Micronesia are **taxis**, **rental cars**, and **private boats**. Taxis are widely available, but the fares can be expensive, especially for long-distance travel. Rental cars are also available, but the cost can be high, and the roads can be rough. Private boats are a popular mode of transportation, especially for traveling between islands. However, the cost of owning and maintaining a boat can be prohibitive for many people.
