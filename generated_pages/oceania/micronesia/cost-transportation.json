The country has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with few buses and no trains. However, the main islands have a network of paved roads, making it possible to travel by car or taxi. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with the capital Palikir having a more developed system than the outer islands.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Micronesia are **taxis**, **rental cars**, and **private boats**. Taxis are widely available, but the fares can be expensive, especially for long-distance travel. Rental cars are also available, but the cost can be high, and the roads can be rough. Private boats are a popular mode of transportation, especially for traveling between islands. However, the cost of owning and maintaining a boat can be prohibitive for many people.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $50 | Limited coverage, mainly in Palikir |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly between towns |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$20 | Widely available |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, by taxi or private car |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $80-$120 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mainly between main islands |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$300 | Typical route, e.g., Palikir to Chuuk |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider using **public buses** or **minibuses** for short distances.\n- For longer distances, **renting a car** or **hiring a taxi** for the day can be more cost-effective.\n- Be sure to **negotiate the fare** with the taxi driver before starting your journey.\n- Use **cash** to pay for transportation, as credit card facilities may be limited.\n- Be aware of **road conditions**, especially during the rainy season, and consider **traveling by air** if possible.\n- Always **wear a seatbelt** and follow local traffic rules to ensure a safe journey.",
