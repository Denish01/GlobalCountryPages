[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Micronesia has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel for visitors from around the world. Citizens of over 50 countries can enter Micronesia visa-free, while others may be eligible for a visa on arrival or may need to obtain a visa in advance. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to promote economic development and tourism.

The visa policy of Micronesia is divided into several categories, including visa-free, visa on arrival, and visa required. The length of stay and the type of visa required depend on the nationality of the visitor and the purpose of their visit. In general, visitors can stay in Micronesia for up to 30 days without a visa, but this can be extended in some cases. The government of Micronesia also offers a range of visa types, including tourist visas, business visas, and student visas, each with its own requirements and restrictions.
