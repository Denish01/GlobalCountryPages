Primary education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 14, and is provided by the government through a network of public schools. Secondary education is also compulsory, and is provided by both public and private schools. Tertiary education is available at a number of colleges and universities, including the **College of Micronesia**, which is the country's only public university. The quality of education in Micronesia is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on English language instruction and a curriculum that is modeled on the US system. However, there are some challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers and a lack of resources, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe public education system in Micronesia is free and compulsory for all children, but there are also a number of private schools that offer alternative educational options. These schools are often church-run or operated by non-governmental organizations, and may offer a more specialized or faith-based curriculum. Despite the challenges, the education system in Micronesia has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in literacy rates and access to education, particularly for girls and women.\n\nThe government of Micronesia has also implemented a number of initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curriculum standards and the provision of training and support for teachers. Additionally, the country has received significant support from international organizations, such as the **Asian Development Bank** and the **World Bank**, which have provided funding and technical assistance to help improve the education system.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
