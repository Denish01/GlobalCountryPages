[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Micronesia is located in the western Pacific Ocean, within the region of Oceania. It is situated northeast of Australia, east of the Philippines, and northwest of Papua New Guinea. The country is an archipelago, consisting of 607 islands, with the four main island states being Yap, Chuuk, Kosrae, and Pohnpei. The islands are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean to the north, east, and south, and the Philippine Sea to the west. Micronesia shares maritime borders with its neighboring countries, including Palau to the west, the Marshall Islands to the east, and Papua New Guinea to the south.

The strategic location of Micronesia has made it an important stopover for traders and travelers throughout history. The country's borders are defined by its maritime boundaries, with the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles from the coastline. The EEZ provides Micronesia with a significant area of ocean territory, rich in marine resources and biodiversity. The country's unique location and geography have also made it vulnerable to climate change, with rising sea levels and increased storm activity posing significant threats to its low-lying islands and coastal communities.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Micronesia is characterized by a mix of high volcanic islands and low-lying coral atolls. The island of Pohnpei is home to the highest point in the country, Mount Finkol, which rises to an elevation of 791 meters. The island of Yap is known for its unique landscape, with a series of small islands and coral reefs surrounding a lagoon. The islands of Chuuk and Kosrae are also volcanic in origin, with steep slopes and rugged coastlines. The coastal areas of Micronesia are generally narrow, with coral reefs and white sandy beaches.

The interior of the islands is covered in dense tropical rainforests, with a wide range of flora and fauna. The forests are home to many unique and endemic species, including the Micronesian kingfisher and the Pohnpei Fantail. The islands are also dotted with freshwater lakes, rivers, and wetlands, which provide important habitats for marine and terrestrial species. The terrain and landscape of Micronesia have been shaped by thousands of years of geological activity, including volcanic eruptions and coral reef growth.

The coastal areas of Micronesia are also home to a number of important ecosystems, including mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and coral reefs. These ecosystems provide important habitat for marine species, including fish, shellfish, and turtles. The coral reefs of Micronesia are some of the most diverse and pristine in the world, with over 1,000 species of fish and 300 species of coral. The reefs are also important for the country's economy, providing a source of food, income, and employment for many communities.
