# Micronesia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Micronesia is relatively underdeveloped, with ongoing efforts to improve roads, power, water, and telecommunications, but still faces significant challenges, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 71% of population
Internet Penetration: 34%
Road Network: 240 km, moderate quality
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 6
Major Ports: 5
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Micronesia's infrastructure development level is hindered by its geographical location, with a vast ocean separating its islands, making it challenging to establish and maintain a comprehensive network of roads, airports, and ports. Recent investments have focused on improving the road network, with the construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing ones. However, the urban-rural gap remains significant, with most infrastructure development concentrated in urban areas such as Palikir, the capital. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this disparity, including the development of rural roads and the provision of basic services such as electricity and water.

The country's infrastructure has been affected by natural disasters, including typhoons and floods, which have damaged roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. As a result, the government has had to divert resources to repair and rebuild damaged infrastructure, rather than investing in new projects. Despite these challenges, Micronesia has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in electricity access, internet penetration, and road quality.

The government has also recognized the importance of investing in infrastructure to drive economic growth and improve the quality of life for its citizens. As a result, it has developed a comprehensive infrastructure development plan, which outlines priorities and strategies for improving the country's infrastructure over the next decade. This plan includes investments in roads, airports, ports, and telecommunications, as well as initiatives to improve energy and water access.

[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]
[TABLE]
| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roads | 240 km | Moderate | Mostly paved, with some gravel and dirt roads |
| Railways | none | n/a | No railway network in Micronesia |
| Airports | 6 international, 2 domestic | Good | International airports in major islands, with regular flights to neighboring countries |
| Ports | 5 major | Moderate | Major ports in Kolonia, Yap, and Chuuk, with regular shipping services |
[/TABLE]

The road network in Micronesia is relatively limited, with most roads concentrated in urban areas. However, the government has invested in improving road quality, with a focus on paving and maintaining existing roads. The country's airport network is more developed, with international airports in major islands and regular flights to neighboring countries. The port network is also well-established, with major ports in Kolonia, Yap, and Chuuk, and regular shipping services to and from the country.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- The main source of power generation in Micronesia is diesel, with a small contribution from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.
- Electricity access is limited, with only 71% of the population having access to electricity, and frequent power outages are common, particularly in rural areas.
- The government has launched initiatives to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of renewable energy sources, including the development of solar and wind power projects.
- The country is also exploring the possibility of connecting to regional power grids, which could provide a more stable and reliable source of electricity.
- Micronesia has set a target of increasing the share of renewable energy in its energy mix to 30% by 2030, as part of its efforts to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- Tap water is not always safe to drink, and many households rely on rainwater collection or bottled water for drinking and cooking.
- Sanitation coverage is limited, with only 50% of households having access to improved sanitation facilities, and the majority of the population relies on traditional latrines or septic tanks.
- Water access is a significant challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on wells, springs, or rainwater collection for their water needs.
- The government has launched initiatives to improve water and sanitation services, including the development of new water supply systems and the rehabilitation of existing ones.
- Micronesia is also working to improve waste management practices, including the disposal of solid waste and wastewater, to protect public health and the environment.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- Mobile phone coverage is relatively good, with most of the population having access to mobile phone services, and the country has seen significant growth in mobile phone subscriptions in recent years.
- Fiber-optic internet is available in some areas, but broadband penetration is limited, and internet speeds are often slow.
- The government has launched initiatives to improve telecommunications services, including the development of new fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile phone coverage to rural areas.
- Micronesia is also exploring the possibility of launching 4G and 5G mobile phone services, which could provide faster and more reliable internet access.
- The country's postal service is relatively well-developed, with regular mail and parcel services available to most areas, and the government is working to improve the efficiency and reliability of the postal service.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The government has launched a major infrastructure development project, which includes the construction of new roads, airports, and ports, and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure.
- The project is funded by a combination of domestic and international sources, including loans from the Asian Development Bank and grants from the United States government.
- The timeline for the project is 2023-2028, and it is expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy and quality of life.
- Micronesia is also working to develop its tourism sector, with a focus on sustainable tourism and eco-tourism, and the government has launched initiatives to improve the country's tourism infrastructure, including the development of new hotels and resorts.
- The country is also exploring the possibility of developing its fishing industry, with a focus on sustainable fishing practices and the development of new fish processing facilities.
