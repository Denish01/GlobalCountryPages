# Best Time to Visit Guam — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Guam is during the dry season, from December to June, when the weather is pleasant and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities and sightseeing. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Guam: December to June. Peak season: July to August. Budget season: April to May. Avoid: September to November and the typhoon season from July to November. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Guam has a tropical marine climate, characterized by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to June, is marked by low humidity and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit the island. The wet season, which runs from July to November, is characterized by high humidity, frequent rain showers, and a higher risk of typhoons. The island's climate is also influenced by its location in the western Pacific, with the trade winds bringing warm and humid air from the equator. The temperature remains relatively constant throughout the year, with average highs ranging from 86°F to 90°F.

The dry season is the best time to enjoy Guam's beautiful beaches, go snorkeling or diving, and explore the island's scenic hiking trails. The dry season is also the peak tourist season, with many visitors flocking to the island to escape the cold winter months in the northern hemisphere. During this time, prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher, and popular attractions can get crowded. In contrast, the wet season is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices, but the weather can be unpredictable and some outdoor activities may be limited.

The wet season, also known as the **typhoon season**, can bring heavy rain and strong winds, making it a less desirable time to visit Guam. However, for those who are looking for a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, the wet season can be a good time to visit, with lower prices and fewer crowds. It's essential to note that Guam is located in a region prone to typhoons, and visitors should be aware of the risks and take necessary precautions.
