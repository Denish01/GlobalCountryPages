# Doing Business in Guam — Investment, FDI & Opportunities

Doing business in Guam can be relatively straightforward, with a stable economy and a favorable location in the Asia-Pacific region, but it also presents unique challenges due to its remote location and limited market size.

[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Guam's business environment is generally favorable, with a stable economy and a strategic location in the Asia-Pacific region. The government of Guam is actively promoting foreign investment, particularly in the tourism and manufacturing sectors. However, the bureaucracy level can be relatively high, with multiple agencies involved in the business registration process. Corruption is not a significant concern, with Guam ranking well in international corruption perception indexes. The government has implemented various initiatives to simplify the business registration process and provide support to foreign investors.

The business climate in Guam is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, as it is an unincorporated territory of the US. This relationship provides access to the US market and financial systems, but it also means that Guam is subject to US laws and regulations. The local government is working to balance the need for economic growth with the need to protect the island's unique culture and environment.

Guam's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, with over 1 million visitors per year, and the government is working to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on a single industry. The island has a highly developed infrastructure, with a modern airport, seaport, and telecommunications system. However, the remote location and limited market size can make it challenging for businesses to operate and grow.
