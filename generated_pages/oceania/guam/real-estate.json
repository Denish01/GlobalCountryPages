The demand for residential and commercial properties is high, particularly in urban areas such as Tamuning and Tumon. The price trajectory of properties in Guam has been increasing over the years, with a significant rise in the past decade.

This has led to an increase in property prices, making it challenging for locals to purchase homes.

The trend is expected to continue, with the property market remaining strong in the coming years.\n\nThe property market in Guam is also influenced by the island's unique cultural and geographical characteristics.
