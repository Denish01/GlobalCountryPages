These villages are not further divided into states or provinces, but rather serve as the primary administrative divisions of the island. The villages are responsible for providing local services such as public works, parks and recreation, and public safety, while the territorial government is responsible for providing services such as education, healthcare, and public transportation.\n\nThe nineteen villages of Guam are: Agana Heights, Agat, Asan, Barrigada, Chalan Pago-Ordot, Dededo, Hagatna, Inarajan, Mangilao, Merizo, Mongmong-Toto-Maite, Piti, Santa Rita, Sinajana, Talofofo, Tamuning, Umatac, Yigo, and Yona.

The Guam Mass Transit Authority provides public bus services throughout the island, with routes connecting major villages and tourist attractions. Driving conditions on Guam are generally good, with well-maintained roads and scenic views. However, traffic congestion can be a problem, particularly during rush hour.
