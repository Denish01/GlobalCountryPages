  "content": "The primary languages spoken in Guam are English and Chamorro, with English being the most widely understood and used language in government, business, and tourism.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): English, Chamorro\nWidely Spoken: Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog\nEnglish Proficiency: High\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Austronesian, Germanic\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nGuam's linguistic landscape is a unique blend of its indigenous Chamorro language, Spanish influences from the colonial period, and English, which was introduced by the United States. The Chamorro language is still spoken by many locals, particularly in traditional and cultural contexts, while English is the dominant language in everyday life, government, and business. Regional dialects of Chamorro can be found in different parts of the island, with some variations in vocabulary and pronunciation. Minority languages such as Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Tagalog are also spoken by smaller communities, reflecting the island's history of immigration and cultural exchange. English is widely understood and used in tourism, making it relatively easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the island.\n\nThe widespread use of English in Guam is due in part to the island's history as a United States territory, as well as the significant presence of American military bases and tourism infrastructure. As a result, many locals are fluent in English, and it is commonly used in government, education, and business. However, the Chamorro language remains an important part of Guam's cultural identity, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote its use, particularly among younger generations.\n\nIn addition to English and Chamorro, other languages such as Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Tagalog can be heard in Guam, particularly in urban areas and among immigrant communities. This linguistic diversity reflects the island's strategic location in the Pacific and its history of cultural exchange and migration. Despite the presence of multiple languages, English remains the dominant language and is widely understood, making it relatively easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the island.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Håfa adai | HA-fa AH-dye | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Håfa | HA-fa | informal |\n| Thank you | Si yu'us ma'ase | SEE-yoo-us MA-ah-seh | formal |\n| Please | På'go | PAH-go | formal |\n| Yes / No | Hai / Kåt | HIGH / KAH-t | formal |\n| Excuse me | Dispensa | dees-PEN-sah | formal |\n| How much? | Magåhet | MAH-gah-het | formal |\n| Where is...? | Nå'la' i ... | NAH-lah EE | formal |\n| I don't understand | Ti hu kånta | TEE HOO KAHN-tah | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Hu spoke Inglis? | HOO SPOH-keh ING-glis | formal |\n| Help! | Ayuda | ah-YOO-dah | formal |\n| Goodbye | Adiós | ah-DEE-yos | formal |\n| Sorry | Dispensa | dees-PEN-sah | formal |\n| How are you? | Håfa kumekelek? | HA-fa KOO-meh-keh-lek | formal |\n| What's your name? | Nå'la' i nåmi-mu? | NAH-lah EE NAH-mee-moo | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Unu | oo-NOO |\n| 2 | Dos | DOH-s |\n| 3 | Tres | TRAY-s |\n| 4 | Kuåtros | KWAH-trohs |\n| 5 | Sinko | SEEN-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | SAY-s |\n| 7 | Sieti | SYEH-tee |\n| 8 | Ocho | OH-choh |\n| 9 | Nuebi | NOO-eh-bee |\n| 10 | Dies | DEE-ehs |\n| 100 | Siyenko | SEE-yen-koh |\n| 1000 | Mil | MEEL |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when interacting with older Chamorros.\n- Use formal language and titles, such as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.,\" when addressing locals, especially in formal settings.\n- Avoid using gestures or body language that may be considered rude or offensive, such as pointing with the feet or touching someone's head.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Chamorro, such as \"håfa adai\" (hello) and \"si yu'us ma'ase\" (thank you), to show respect and appreciation for the local culture.\n- Be patient and listen carefully when communicating with locals, as English proficiency may vary.\n- Use visual aids, such as maps or pictures, to help communicate when language barriers exist.\n- Avoid interrupting or finishing sentences for others, as this can be considered impolite.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with language barriers and communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a language class or workshop to learn more about the Chamorro language and culture.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites or YouTube videos, to learn more about the Chamorro language and culture.\n- Visit the Guam Visitors Bureau or local tourism office for information and assistance with language and cultural nuances.",
