Guam, as a territory of the United States, has a relatively lower cost of living compared to Hawaii, which is a state with a high demand for housing and services. The overall cost of living in Guam is around 20-30% lower than in Hawaii, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a more affordable Pacific island lifestyle. However, it's essential to note that both territories have unique characteristics that affect their cost of living, and individual circumstances can vary greatly.\n\nThe economic context of both territories also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Guam's economy is primarily driven by tourism and military spending, while Hawaii's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and technology. This diversification contributes to Hawaii's higher cost of living, as the demand for goods and services is higher. In contrast, Guam's economy is more localized, which can result in lower prices for certain goods and services.
