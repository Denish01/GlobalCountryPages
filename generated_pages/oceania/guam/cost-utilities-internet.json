However, the costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity bills during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The Guam Power Authority and the Guam Waterworks Authority are the primary providers of electricity and water, respectively. The costs of utilities in Guam are generally stable, but prices may increase over time due to rising fuel costs and other factors.\n\nThe territory's tropical climate means that air conditioning is a necessity for most of the year, which can drive up electricity bills. However, the use of energy-efficient appliances and practices such as turning off lights and electronics when not in use can help reduce costs. Water conservation is also important, as Guam is a small island with limited freshwater resources. The Guam Waterworks Authority offers tips and incentives for water conservation, including low-flow showerheads and toilets.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $100 | $150 | $200 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane for cooking) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $20 | $30 | $40 | (included in rent or separate) |\n| **Total** | **$150** | **$225** | **$300** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10-20 Mbps | GTA, Docomo Pacific |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 50-100 Mbps | GTA, Docomo Pacific |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-30 | 1-10 GB | GTA, Docomo Pacific |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-60 | 10-20 GB | GTA, Docomo Pacific |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | GTA, Docomo Pacific |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $13 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $10 | (Guam-based streaming services) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Guam, residents typically need to provide identification and proof of address, and may need to pay a deposit.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, which can help residents budget and avoid surprise bills.\n- The best internet providers in Guam are GTA and Docomo Pacific, which offer fast and reliable fiber internet plans.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of water conservation incentives.\n- Residents can also consider bundling phone and internet services to save money and simplify their bills.",
