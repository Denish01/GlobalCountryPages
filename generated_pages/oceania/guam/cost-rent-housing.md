[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Guam is highly competitive, with a high demand for housing due to the island's growing population and limited supply of available units. Typical lease terms in Guam range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit usually equal to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Guam Landlord and Tenant Act, which requires landlords to provide a written lease agreement and maintain a safe and habitable living environment. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as the Northern Mariana Islands and Micronesia, Guam's housing costs are relatively high due to its proximity to the United States and the presence of a large military base.

The housing market in Guam is also influenced by the island's tourism industry, with many apartments and homes being rented out to visitors on a short-term basis. This has led to a shortage of long-term rentals, making it difficult for residents to find affordable housing. Additionally, the cost of living in Guam is high due to the island's remote location and reliance on imported goods. As a result, renters in Guam often have to pay a premium for housing, with prices comparable to those found in major cities in the United States.
