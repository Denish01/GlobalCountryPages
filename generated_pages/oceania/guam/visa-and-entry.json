Citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access may be able to obtain a visa on arrival or through a US embassy or consulate.\n\nThe visa policy of Guam is closely tied to that of the United States, and visitors who are eligible to enter the US without a visa are generally also eligible to enter Guam without a visa. However, there may be additional requirements or restrictions for certain nationalities, so it's crucial to check with the official authorities before traveling.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | N/A | 90 days | US citizens can enter Guam with a valid passport or other accepted ID |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa Waiver Program | 90 days | UK citizens can enter Guam under the Visa Waiver Program |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa Waiver Program | 90 days | Most EU citizens can enter Guam under the Visa Waiver Program |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa Waiver Program | 90 days | Canadian citizens can enter Guam under the Visa Waiver Program |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa Waiver Program | 90 days | Australian citizens can enter Guam under the Visa Waiver Program |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Non-immigrant visa | 30 days | Indian citizens need to apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Non-immigrant visa | 30 days | Chinese citizens need to apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Guam for up to 90 days without a visa, as long as they meet the requirements for visa-free access.
