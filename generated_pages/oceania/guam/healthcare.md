[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Guam is a mix of public and private providers, with the **Guam Memorial Hospital** serving as the primary public hospital. The hospital provides a range of services, including emergency care, surgery, and specialty clinics. Private hospitals and clinics, such as the **Guam Regional Medical City**, also offer high-quality care and specialized services. The quality of care in Guam is generally good, with many healthcare professionals trained in the United States. However, some specialized services may require medical evacuation to the US mainland or other countries. Urban areas, such as Hagatna and Tamuning, have relatively easy access to medical facilities, while rural areas may have more limited access.

The **Department of Public Health and Social Services** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system in Guam, including regulating healthcare providers, managing public health programs, and providing healthcare services to the community. The department also works to improve healthcare access and quality, particularly in rural areas. Despite these efforts, there are still some challenges in the healthcare system, including a shortage of certain specialized healthcare professionals and limited access to some medical services.

Overall, the healthcare system in Guam is well-developed and provides a range of services to the island's residents and visitors. However, it is still important for individuals to have health insurance to cover the cost of medical care, particularly for specialized services or medical evacuations. [CALLOUT] It is recommended that visitors and residents have health insurance that covers them in Guam, as medical costs can be high. [/CALLOUT]
