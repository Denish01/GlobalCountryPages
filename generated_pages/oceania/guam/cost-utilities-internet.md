[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Guam's utility infrastructure is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity bills during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The Guam Power Authority and the Guam Waterworks Authority are the primary providers of electricity and water, respectively. The costs of utilities in Guam are generally stable, but prices may increase over time due to rising fuel costs and other factors.

The territory's tropical climate means that air conditioning is a necessity for most of the year, which can drive up electricity bills. However, the use of energy-efficient appliances and practices such as turning off lights and electronics when not in use can help reduce costs. Water conservation is also important, as Guam is a small island with limited freshwater resources. The Guam Waterworks Authority offers tips and incentives for water conservation, including low-flow showerheads and toilets.
