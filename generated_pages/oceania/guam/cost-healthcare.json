The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, but it is still accessible to locals and foreigners alike. However, the public system often has long wait times and limited resources, making private healthcare a more attractive option for those who can afford it. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary option, while foreigners may prefer to use private facilities, which offer higher quality care but at a higher cost.\n\nThe healthcare system in Guam works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals being eligible for government-funded healthcare programs, while foreigners are typically required to have private insurance to cover their medical expenses. It is highly recommended that foreigners have insurance to cover their medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare in Guam can be very high. Many private insurance plans are available, offering a range of coverage options, from basic to comprehensive. It's essential to research and choose a plan that suits your needs and budget.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$250 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, dental, vision |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Worldwide coverage, doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, dental, vision |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10 and $50 per prescription, depending on the type and quantity of medication.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and convenience stores, with prices similar to those in the US.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a licensed doctor in Guam, while others can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in Guam, with many located in shopping centers and near hospitals.\n- It's essential to check the prices and availability of medication before purchasing, as they can vary between pharmacies.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts or loyalty programs, which can help reduce the cost of medication.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call 911 or visit the emergency room at the Guam Memorial Hospital.
