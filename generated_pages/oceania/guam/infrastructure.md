[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Guam's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, driven by the territory's growing economy and strategic location in the Pacific. The government has invested heavily in upgrading the island's transportation network, including the expansion of the international airport and the construction of new roads and highways. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with the latter often lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. Despite these challenges, Guam's infrastructure is generally considered to be of high quality, with modern amenities and facilities available in most areas.

The territory's infrastructure development has been driven by a combination of public and private investment, with a focus on supporting the growth of key industries such as tourism and manufacturing. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in foreign investment in Guam's infrastructure, particularly from Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea. This has helped to drive the development of new projects and facilities, including the construction of a new power plant and the expansion of the island's telecommunications network.

Guam's infrastructure is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, which provides significant funding and support for the territory's development. The US military has a major presence on the island, and has invested heavily in the development of Guam's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and facilities. This has helped to drive economic growth and development in the territory, but has also raised concerns about the impact of military activities on the environment and local communities.
