[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Guam is easily accessible by air, with the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport (GUM) being the main entry point for international visitors. The airport is located in Tamuning, about 5 miles northeast of the capital city Hagatna. Direct flights are available from major hubs such as Tokyo, Seoul, and Manila, as well as from other destinations in the Pacific and the United States. For those traveling from the neighboring Northern Mariana Islands or other parts of Micronesia, there are also ferry services available, although these may be less frequent and less convenient than flying.

Overland entry points do not exist in Guam, as it is an island territory surrounded by water. However, visitors can arrive by private boat or yacht, with several marinas and ports available around the island. It is essential to note that all visitors to Guam must comply with US customs and immigration regulations, regardless of their mode of arrival. This includes obtaining any necessary visas or travel documents before arrival, as well as declaring all goods and currency upon entry.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Guam has a limited domestic air network, with most flights connecting the island to other destinations in the region rather than within the territory itself. However, there are some domestic airlines that offer flights to nearby islands, such as the Northern Mariana Islands. United Airlines and Japan Airlines are among the carriers that operate domestic flights in the region. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs can range from $200 to $500 or more per person for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Guam has no rail network, making trains and rail travel not an option for getting around the island. Visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to explore the territory.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Guam has a public bus system that connects major towns and cities, including Hagatna, Tamuning, and Tumon. The Guam Regional Transit Authority (GRTA) operates bus services throughout the island, with routes and schedules available on their website. The bus system is a convenient and affordable way to get around, with fares starting at around $3 per ride. However, the frequency and coverage of bus services may be limited in some areas, especially outside of major towns and cities.
