[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Guam's main transportation modes include taxis, buses, and ride-hailing services, with most people relying on personal vehicles to get around the island. The quality of public transit is relatively limited, with a lack of comprehensive bus networks and no metro or subway system. However, the island's small size and relatively low population density make it easy to navigate, and many residents opt for driving their own vehicles or using taxi services.

The island's public transportation system is primarily composed of buses and taxis, with some ride-hailing services available. The bus system, operated by the Guam Regional Transit Authority, provides limited coverage of the island, with most routes focusing on the main tourist areas and commercial centers. Taxis are widely available, but can be more expensive than using public transportation or ride-hailing services. Despite the limitations of public transportation, Guam's small size and scenic roads make it a popular destination for drivers and cyclists.
