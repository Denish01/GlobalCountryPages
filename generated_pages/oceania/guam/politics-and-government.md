[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Guam's political system is based on the principles of **democracy** and **representative government**, with a **separation of powers** among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The Governor of Guam serves as the head of government, while the President of the United States serves as the head of state. The Guam Legislature is a unicameral body, composed of 15 members who are elected by the people of Guam. The island's government is responsible for providing various public services, including education, healthcare, and public safety, while the U.S. federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and interstate commerce.

The government of Guam operates under the **Organic Act of Guam**, which was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1950. This act established Guam as an unincorporated territory of the United States and provided for the island's government to be headed by a governor and a legislature. The act also established the **Guam Constitution**, which outlines the powers and responsibilities of the island's government. While Guam has a significant degree of autonomy, the U.S. federal government retains the authority to review and approve certain laws and policies.

Guam's political system is also influenced by its **cultural heritage**, with the **Chamorro** people playing a significant role in the island's history and identity. The Chamorro language and culture are recognized and protected by the government of Guam, and efforts are made to promote the island's unique cultural heritage.
