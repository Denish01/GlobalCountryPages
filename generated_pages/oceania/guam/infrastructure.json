  "content": "The infrastructure in Guam is well-developed, with a strong focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications, but there are still challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 71%\nRoad Network: 674 km, paved and well-maintained\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 3\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nGuam's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, driven by the territory's growing economy and strategic location in the Pacific. The government has invested heavily in upgrading the island's transportation network, including the expansion of the international airport and the construction of new roads and highways. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with the latter often lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. Despite these challenges, Guam's infrastructure is generally considered to be of high quality, with modern amenities and facilities available in most areas.\n\nThe territory's infrastructure development has been driven by a combination of public and private investment, with a focus on supporting the growth of key industries such as tourism and manufacturing. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in foreign investment in Guam's infrastructure, particularly from Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea. This has helped to drive the development of new projects and facilities, including the construction of a new power plant and the expansion of the island's telecommunications network.\n\nGuam's infrastructure is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, which provides significant funding and support for the territory's development. The US military has a major presence on the island, and has invested heavily in the development of Guam's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and facilities. This has helped to drive economic growth and development in the territory, but has also raised concerns about the impact of military activities on the environment and local communities.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 674 km | Good | Well-maintained and paved, with some traffic congestion in urban areas |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network on the island |\n| Airports | 2 international, 1 domestic | Good | Modern facilities and services, with regular flights to major destinations |\n| Ports | 3 major | Good | Well-equipped and efficient, with regular cargo and passenger services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Guam's power generation is primarily based on fossil fuels, with a mix of diesel and heavy fuel oil used to generate electricity\n- The territory has a total installed capacity of 557 MW, with a peak demand of around 300 MW\n- The reliability of the power supply is generally good, with an average outage duration of around 2 hours per year\n- Guam has set a target of generating 25% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035, with a focus on solar and wind power\n- The territory is also exploring the potential for energy storage and grid modernization to support the integration of renewable energy sources\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Tap water is generally considered safe to drink, with a high level of treatment and quality control\n- Sanitation coverage is around 95%, with most households connected to a modern sewerage system\n- Water access is generally good, with around 99% of households having access to a reliable water supply\n- There are some challenges in rural areas, where water access can be limited and sanitation coverage is lower\n- The government has implemented a number of initiatives to improve water and sanitation services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the expansion of the sewerage network\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile coverage is around 95%, with a range of services and providers available\n- Fiber-optic broadband is available in most areas, with speeds of up to 1 Gbps\n- 4G services are widely available, with 5G rollout planned for the near future\n- The territory has a well-developed telecommunications network, with a range of services and providers available\n- Postal services are provided by the US Postal Service, with regular mail and package delivery services available\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The construction of a new power plant, which will increase the territory's generating capacity and reduce reliance on fossil fuels\n- The expansion of the international airport, which will increase capacity and improve facilities for passengers and cargo\n- The development of a new port facility, which will increase the territory's cargo handling capacity and improve efficiency\n- The rollout of 5G services, which will provide faster and more reliable mobile broadband services\n- The construction of new roads and highways, which will improve connectivity and reduce traffic congestion in urban areas",
