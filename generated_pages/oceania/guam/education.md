[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Guam is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, also known as elementary education, typically lasts for six years and is mandatory for all children between the ages of five and eleven. Secondary education, or high school, lasts for six years and is also mandatory, with students typically graduating at the age of seventeen or eighteen. Tertiary education, or college, is not mandatory but is highly encouraged, with several institutions of higher learning available on the island. The quality of education in Guam is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on **standardized testing** and **college preparation**. Public schools are free and open to all residents, while private schools, including **parochial schools** and **military schools**, offer alternative options for families who can afford them.

The public school system in Guam is overseen by the Guam Department of Education, which is responsible for setting academic standards, curriculum, and educational policies. The department also provides resources and support to teachers, administrators, and students to ensure that all students have access to a high-quality education. In contrast, private schools in Guam are often more expensive and may have selective admissions processes, but they offer a range of academic and extracurricular programs that may not be available in public schools.

However, challenges still remain, including a shortage of qualified teachers in certain subjects, limited resources, and a high dropout rate among certain student populations.
