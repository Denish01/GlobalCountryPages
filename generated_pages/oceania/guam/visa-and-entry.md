# Guam Visa & Entry Requirements

As a territory of the United States, Guam has a relatively liberal visa policy, and citizens of many countries can enter the island without a visa or with a visa on arrival, but it's essential to verify the specific requirements for your nationality before traveling.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Guam's visa policy is relatively open, with citizens of over 30 countries eligible for visa-free access, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and many European nations. The island territory aims to attract tourists and business travelers, and its visa policy reflects this goal. Citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access may be able to obtain a visa on arrival or through a US embassy or consulate.

The visa policy of Guam is closely tied to that of the United States, and visitors who are eligible to enter the US without a visa are generally also eligible to enter Guam without a visa. However, there may be additional requirements or restrictions for certain nationalities, so it's crucial to check with the official authorities before traveling.
