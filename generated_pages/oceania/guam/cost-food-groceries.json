  "content": "The cost of food in Guam can range from $15 to $30 per meal at a mid-range restaurant, while a monthly grocery budget for one person can be between $500 to $700 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($10-$15 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($25-$40 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($500-$700 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($5-$7 USD)\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nGuam's food prices are generally higher than the regional average due to its remote location and reliance on imported goods. The island's unique cultural blend of Chamorro, Spanish, Japanese, and American influences has created a diverse and vibrant food scene, with a wide range of options available. However, eating out can be expensive, with prices driven up by high labor costs, import fees, and limited competition. In contrast, home cooking is a more affordable option, with many locals opting to prepare traditional dishes using fresh seafood, meats, and produce from local markets.\n\nThe cost of food in Guam is also affected by the island's limited agricultural production, which means that many staples, such as rice, bread, and dairy products, must be imported. This can drive up prices, especially for specialty or organic items. Additionally, the island's tourist economy and military presence can also impact food prices, with some restaurants and stores catering to visitors and personnel with higher-priced menus and products. Despite these factors, Guam's food scene remains a unique and exciting reflection of the island's cultural heritage, with many affordable options available for those who know where to look.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $3-$5 | 3-5 USD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2-$4 | 2-4 USD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-$3 | 2-3 USD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2-$4 | 2-4 USD | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8-$12 | 8-12 USD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12-$18 | 12-18 USD | Imported from the US |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $6-$10 | 6-10 USD | Imported from the US |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3-$5 | 3-5 USD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2-$4 | 2-4 USD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1-$3 | 1-3 USD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10-$15 | 10-15 USD | Goat cheese or similar |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-$4 | 2-4 USD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (typical dishes like BBQ, seafood) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$30 | (one person, e.g. burger, salad) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$50 | (3 courses, e.g. steak, seafood) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, e.g. sushi, steakhouse) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $7-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $4-$6 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$4 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Guam offers a mix of modern supermarkets and traditional local markets. Supermarkets like Pay-Less Supermarket and Costco offer a wide range of imported and local products, but prices can be higher due to the cost of importing goods. In contrast, local markets like the Hagatna Market and the Dededo Flea Market offer fresh produce, meats, and seafood at lower prices, but with a more limited selection. Bargaining is not typically expected at supermarkets, but it is common at local markets, where vendors may be willing to negotiate prices for bulk purchases or regular customers.\n\nFor the best value, shoppers should consider visiting local markets for fresh produce, meats, and seafood, while supermarkets may be a better option for staples like rice, bread, and dairy products. Additionally, some supermarkets offer loyalty programs or discounts for bulk purchases, which can help reduce costs. It's also worth noting that some local markets may offer unique or specialty products, such as traditional Chamorro dishes or handmade crafts, which can be a fun and affordable way to experience the island's culture.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries or food trucks can be a affordable and delicious way to experience Guam's cuisine, with prices starting from $5-$10 per meal.\n- Traditional Chamorro dishes like **kelaguen** (a raw fish salad) or **tinaktak** (a meat stew) are often made with fresh, locally-sourced ingredients and can be a good value.\n- Fresh seafood is abundant in Guam, and buying it directly from local fishermen or markets can be a cost-effective option.\n- **Rice** is a staple in Guam, and buying it in bulk can be a good way to save money.\n- Avoid buying imported or specialty products, which can be expensive due to high import fees.\n- Consider shopping at local markets or using **coupons** or **discounts** offered by supermarkets to reduce costs.",
