Typical lease terms in Guam range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit usually equal to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Guam Landlord and Tenant Act, which requires landlords to provide a written lease agreement and maintain a safe and habitable living environment. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as the Northern Mariana Islands and Micronesia, Guam's housing costs are relatively high due to its proximity to the United States and the presence of a large military base.\n\nThe housing market in Guam is also influenced by the island's tourism industry, with many apartments and homes being rented out to visitors on a short-term basis. This has led to a shortage of long-term rentals, making it difficult for residents to find affordable housing. Additionally, the cost of living in Guam is high due to the island's remote location and reliance on imported goods. As a result, renters in Guam often have to pay a premium for housing, with prices comparable to those found in major cities in the United States.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,000-$1,400 | $800-$1,200 | small, basic units |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $900-$1,400 | standard, furnished units |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,800 | $1,400-$2,200 | family-sized, amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $2,000-$3,200 | spacious, luxury units |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $4,500-$6,000 | prime locations, ocean views |\n| Suburbs | $2,500-$4,000 | residential areas, amenities |\n| Rural | $1,500-$2,500 | rural areas, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Tamuning: $1,200-$2,000 per month, a popular area for expats with many amenities and restaurants\n- Tumon: $1,500-$2,500 per month, a tourist area with many hotels and resorts, but also some residential units\n- Hagatna: $1,000-$1,800 per month, the capital city with a mix of old and new buildings, and a vibrant nightlife\n- Mangilao: $900-$1,600 per month, a residential area with a more local feel, and easy access to the university\n- Dededo: $800-$1,400 per month, a large village with a mix of residential and commercial areas, and a growing expat community\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Guam [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find available units and negotiate prices\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market in Guam can be competitive\n- Make sure to read and understand the lease agreement before signing, and ask questions if you're unsure\n- Consider renting a unit that is **furnished**, as this can save you money on furniture and appliances\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting renters, and never send money or sign a lease without seeing the unit in person\n- Utilities such as **electricity** and **water** are usually not included in the rent, so be sure to factor these costs into your budget",
