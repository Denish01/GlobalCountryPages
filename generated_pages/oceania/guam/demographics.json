The island's urban population is predominantly concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Hagatna, Tamuning, and Tumon, with approximately 94% of the population residing in urban areas. This urbanization trend is largely driven by economic opportunities, with many residents moving to urban centers for work, education, and healthcare. Guam's population growth is also influenced by its strategic location, with the island serving as a key hub for military, tourism, and trade activities in the Pacific.\n\nThe population of Guam has been shaped by its history as a Spanish colony, a Japanese-occupied territory during World War II, and a United States territory since 1944. This complex history has resulted in a unique cultural identity, with a blend of indigenous Chamorro, Asian, and American influences. The island's population is also characterized by a high level of migration, with many residents moving to Guam for work, education, or military service. This migration has contributed to the island's cultural diversity, with a significant proportion of the population born outside of Guam.\n\nGuam's population growth has also been influenced by its economy, which is largely driven by tourism, military spending, and government services. The island's economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by an increase in tourism and military spending. However, this growth has also put pressure on the island's infrastructure, with concerns about overcrowding, traffic congestion, and environmental degradation.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chamorro | 37% | Indigenous | Original inhabitants of Guam |\n| Filipino | 26% | Southeast Asia | Significant migrant population |\n| White | 10% | United States | Primarily American military and expatriates |\n| Chinese | 7% | East Asia | Economic migrants and business owners |\n| Japanese | 4% | East Asia | Historical and economic ties |\n| Korean | 3% | East Asia | Economic migrants and military personnel |\n| Other | 13% | Various | Includes Pacific Islanders, Southeast Asians, and others |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity of Guam is a significant aspect of the island's cultural identity, with a complex mix of indigenous, Asian, and American influences.
