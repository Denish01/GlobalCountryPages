A budget of $1,500-$2,000 per month can provide a basic but comfortable life, while a mid-range budget of $2,500-$3,000 per month can offer a more relaxed lifestyle with some luxuries. A comfortable budget of $3,500-$4,500 per month can provide a high standard of living with plenty of opportunities for entertainment and travel.\n\nCompared to neighboring countries, Guam is more expensive than the Northern Mariana Islands and Micronesia, but slightly cheaper than Hawaii.

For example, a mid-range individual can afford a one-bedroom apartment for around $1,000-$1,200 per month, eat out at restaurants a few times a week, and use a combination of public and private transportation.
