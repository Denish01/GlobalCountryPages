The typical lease term is 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by French law, which applies in New Caledonia as a territory of France. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Vanuatu and Fiji, New Caledonia's housing costs are relatively high, making it one of the more expensive places to live in the Pacific.\n\nThe housing market in New Caledonia is also influenced by the territory's unique cultural and economic context. The country has a high standard of living, with a strong economy driven by the mining and tourism industries. This has led to a high demand for housing, particularly in Noumea, where many expats and locals live and work. However, the housing market can be challenging to navigate, particularly for foreigners, and it is recommended to work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | 600-900 | 400-700 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | 800-1,200 | 500-900 | modern, fully equipped |\n| 2 Bedroom | 1,200-1,800 | 800-1,400 | family size, comfortable living |\n| 3 Bedroom | 1,800-2,500 | 1,200-2,000 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | 3,000-5,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | 2,000-3,500 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | 1,000-2,000 | countryside, peaceful living |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Baie des Citrons**: a popular neighborhood with a range of apartments and houses, close to the city center, with rents ranging from $800-1,200 USD per month\n- **Anse Vata**: a coastal neighborhood with stunning views, a range of accommodation options, and a lively atmosphere, with rents ranging from $1,000-1,500 USD per month\n- **Val Plaisance**: a family-friendly neighborhood with a range of houses and apartments, close to schools and amenities, with rents ranging from $600-1,000 USD per month\n- **Ducos**: a residential neighborhood with a range of apartments and houses, close to the city center, with rents ranging from $500-900 USD per month\n- **Montravel**: a quiet neighborhood with a range of apartments and houses, close to the countryside, with rents ranging from $400-700 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for New Caledonia [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to find the best deals on rent and housing prices\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit of 2-3 months' rent when signing a lease\n- Check the property carefully before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition\n- Consider the cost of utilities, such as electricity and water, which are usually not included in the rent\n- Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit without seeing the property and signing a lease agreement",
