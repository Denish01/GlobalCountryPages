[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
New Caledonia's healthcare system is based on the French model, with a mix of public and private providers. The public system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical staff and modern equipment. However, there can be long waiting times for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare providers are also available, and many expats and tourists choose to use these services for quicker access to medical care. In urban areas, such as Noumea, access to healthcare is generally good, with a range of medical facilities and specialists available. In rural areas, access to healthcare can be more limited, with fewer medical facilities and specialists available.

The quality of care in New Caledonia is generally high, with many medical professionals having received training in France or other European countries. However, there can be some challenges in terms of accessing specialized care, particularly in rural areas. The government of New Caledonia has made efforts to improve access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas, through the development of new medical facilities and the recruitment of more medical staff.

Despite the overall high quality of healthcare in New Caledonia, there are some challenges to be aware of, particularly in terms of accessing medical care in emergency situations. The emergency services number is 15, and ambulance services are generally reliable. However, medical facilities can be some distance away, particularly in rural areas, and evacuation to Noumea or other major centers may be necessary in serious cases.
