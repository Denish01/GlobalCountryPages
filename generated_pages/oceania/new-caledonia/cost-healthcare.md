New Caledonia has a mixed healthcare system, combining both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality and widely accessible to locals, with most medical expenses being covered by the French social security system. However, for foreigners, the situation can be more complex, and having health insurance is highly recommended to cover any unexpected medical expenses. The private healthcare sector offers more personalized care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. Many medical professionals in New Caledonia are trained in France, ensuring a high standard of care.

The healthcare system in New Caledonia is well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical centers providing a wide range of medical services. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the first point of contact for medical care, while foreigners may prefer to use private healthcare services. In either case, having some form of health insurance can provide peace of mind and financial protection in case of unexpected medical expenses. It is worth noting that while the public healthcare system is generally of good quality, some specialized medical services may not be available in New Caledonia, and medical evacuation to France or other countries may be necessary in certain cases.
