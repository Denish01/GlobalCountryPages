The cost of living in New Caledonia is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which affects the prices of staple goods such as rice, bread, and dairy products. However, the island's rich marine resources and fertile soil also provide an abundance of fresh seafood and locally grown produce, which can be more affordable than imported alternatives. Eating out is a popular pastime in New Caledonia, with a mix of French, Melanesian, and Asian influences reflected in the local cuisine. However, home cooking is also common, with many residents opting to prepare meals using fresh ingredients from local markets.\n\nThe food culture in New Caledonia is shaped by its French heritage and Pacific Island location. Traditional dishes such as **Bougnat** (a meat and vegetable stew) and **Poulet au Coco** (coconut chicken) are popular, and are often served with a side of rice, bread, or **Taro** (a staple root vegetable). The island's cuisine is also influenced by its Asian and Melanesian communities, with dishes such as **Sushi** and **Laplap** (a Melanesian-style dish made with taro and meat or fish) also featuring on menus. Despite the high cost of living, New Caledonia offers a unique and flavorful culinary experience that reflects its cultural diversity.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 250 XPF | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $3.00 | 300 XPF | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $4.00 | 400 XPF | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2.00 | 200 XPF | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8.00 | 800 XPF | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12.00 | 1200 XPF | Imported from Australia or New Zealand |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 500 XPF | Imported from France or Australia |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3.00 | 300 XPF | Locally grown |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 250 XPF | Locally grown |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $2.00 | 200 XPF | Locally grown |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10.00 | 1000 XPF | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2.00 | 200 XPF | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | Typical dishes include Bougnat and Poulet au Coco |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$30 | One person, includes a main course and drink |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | 3 courses, includes a bottle of wine |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $100-$150 | Upscale, includes a 5-course menu and wine pairings |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $4-$6 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of goods at supermarkets and local markets in New Caledonia can vary significantly. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, especially for imported goods, while local markets offer fresher produce at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of tomatoes may cost $3.00 at a supermarket, but only $2.00 at a local market. However, supermarkets often have a wider range of products, including imported goods, and may offer more convenient shopping hours. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more authentic shopping experience and the opportunity to interact with local vendors.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to bargain and negotiate prices, especially for larger purchases. Vendors may be willing to lower their prices if you buy in bulk or show a willingness to walk away. Additionally, local markets often offer a wider range of fresh produce, including exotic fruits and vegetables that may not be available at supermarkets. Some popular local markets include the **Marché de Nouméa** and the **Marché de Baie des Citrons**, which offer a wide range of goods, including fresh produce, meats, and handicrafts.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries and street food stalls can be a affordable and delicious way to experience the local cuisine, with meals starting from $10-$15 USD.\n- Fresh seafood is a staple in New Caledonia, and can be purchased at local markets or directly from fishermen, often at lower prices than at supermarkets.\n- **Taro** and **Yam** are staple root vegetables that are widely available and affordable, and can be used in a variety of dishes.\n- Imported goods, such as beef and dairy products, can be expensive, so it's a good idea to opt for local alternatives whenever possible.\n- **Bougna** is a traditional Melanesian dish made with taro, yam, and banana, and is a cheap and nutritious option, often available at local markets and eateries.\n- Avoid buying imported snacks and processed foods, which can be expensive and lack nutritional value, and instead opt for fresh, locally grown produce and whole foods.",
