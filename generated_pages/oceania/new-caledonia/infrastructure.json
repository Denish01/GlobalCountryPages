  "content": "New Caledonia's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on roads, ports, and energy, but still faces challenges in terms of rural access and reliability.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 98% of population\nInternet Penetration: 74%\nRoad Network: 5,622 km, paved and well-maintained\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 4\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nNew Caledonia's infrastructure is generally well-developed, with a strong focus on roads, ports, and energy. The territory has invested heavily in recent years to improve its infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on upgrading its road network and expanding its port facilities. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The territory's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and earthquakes, which can cause significant damage and disruption.\n\nThe French government has provided significant funding for infrastructure development in New Caledonia, with a focus on improving the territory's connectivity and competitiveness. This has included investments in new roads, ports, and energy infrastructure, as well as initiatives to improve the territory's telecommunications and water supply systems. Despite these efforts, however, New Caledonia still faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure development, particularly in rural areas.\n\nNew Caledonia's infrastructure is also closely tied to its economy, with the territory's **mining** and **tourism** industries relying heavily on access to reliable and efficient infrastructure. The territory's **port facilities**, in particular, play a critical role in the export of minerals and other goods, while its **airport** and **road network** are essential for the tourism industry.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 5,622 km | Good | Paved and well-maintained, with some rural areas still lacking access |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in New Caledonia |\n| Airports | 3 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern facilities and equipment, with some limitations in rural areas |\n| Ports | 4 major | Good | Well-equipped and efficient, with some limitations in terms of capacity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- New Caledonia's power generation is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with some renewable energy sources, such as **solar** and **wind power**, being developed.\n- The territory's electricity grid is generally reliable, but can be vulnerable to outages and disruptions, particularly during natural disasters.\n- New Caledonia has set a target of generating 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025, with a focus on **solar** and **wind power**.\n- The territory's energy sector is dominated by the state-owned **Electricité de Nouvelle-Calédonie** (EDNC), which is responsible for generating and distributing electricity.\n- New Caledonia is also exploring the potential for **geothermal energy**, with several projects currently under development.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- New Caledonia's tap water is generally safe to drink, with a high level of **water quality** and **treatment**.\n- The territory's sanitation coverage is also high, with most households having access to **sewerage** and **wastewater treatment**.\n- However, some rural areas still lack access to reliable **water supply** and **sanitation**, with many communities relying on **rainwater collection** and **septic tanks**.\n- New Caledonia has made significant progress in improving its water and sanitation infrastructure, with a focus on upgrading its **water treatment plants** and **sewerage systems**.\n- The territory is also working to improve its **water conservation** and **water efficiency**, with a focus on reducing **water waste** and promoting **sustainable water management**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- New Caledonia has a well-developed **telecommunications** sector, with a high level of **mobile coverage** and **internet penetration**.\n- The territory's **fiber-optic network** is also well-developed, with most households and businesses having access to **high-speed internet**.\n- New Caledonia has launched several initiatives to improve its **digital infrastructure**, including the deployment of **4G** and **5G** networks.\n- The territory's **postal services** are also well-developed, with a reliable and efficient **mail delivery** system.\n- New Caledonia is also working to improve its **cybersecurity**, with a focus on protecting its **critical infrastructure** and **personal data**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- New Caledonia is currently investing in several major infrastructure projects, including the **upgrade of its road network** and the **expansion of its port facilities**.\n- The territory is also developing several **renewable energy** projects, including **solar** and **wind power**.\n- The French government has provided significant funding for these projects, with a focus on improving the territory's **connectivity** and **competitiveness**.\n- New Caledonia is also working to improve its **water supply** and **sanitation** infrastructure, with a focus on upgrading its **water treatment plants** and **sewerage systems**.\n- The territory is also exploring the potential for **public-private partnerships** to finance and deliver its infrastructure projects, with a focus on leveraging private sector investment and expertise.",
