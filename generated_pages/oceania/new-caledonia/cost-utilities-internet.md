[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
New Caledonia's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the summer months. The territory's remote location and limited connectivity to the global grid also contribute to higher utility costs. The cost of utilities in New Caledonia is relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in prices over the past few years. However, the cost of electricity is expected to increase in the coming years due to the territory's dependence on imported fossil fuels.

The seasonal variation in utility costs is mainly due to the tourism industry, which peaks during the summer months. This increased demand for utilities, particularly electricity and water, can lead to higher costs for residents and businesses. Additionally, the territory's tropical climate means that air conditioning and refrigeration are essential, which can drive up electricity costs. To mitigate these costs, residents and businesses can take advantage of energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy sources, such as solar power.
