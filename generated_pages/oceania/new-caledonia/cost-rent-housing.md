[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
New Caledonia's rental market is relatively small, with a high demand for apartments and houses, particularly in the capital city of Noumea. The typical lease term is 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by French law, which applies in New Caledonia as a territory of France. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Vanuatu and Fiji, New Caledonia's housing costs are relatively high, making it one of the more expensive places to live in the Pacific.

The housing market in New Caledonia is also influenced by the territory's unique cultural and economic context. The country has a high standard of living, with a strong economy driven by the mining and tourism industries. This has led to a high demand for housing, particularly in Noumea, where many expats and locals live and work. However, the housing market can be challenging to navigate, particularly for foreigners, and it is recommended to work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property.
