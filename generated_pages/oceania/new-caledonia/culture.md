# New Caledonia Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

New Caledonia's culture is a unique blend of French, Melanesian, and Pacific Island influences, shaped by its history as a French territory in the Pacific Ocean. 

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
New Caledonia's cultural identity is defined by its complex history, with the indigenous Kanak people, European settlers, and Asian immigrants all contributing to the territory's diverse cultural landscape. The Kanak people, who make up about 40% of the population, have a distinct culture and language, with a strong emphasis on traditional customs and practices. The French influence is also evident, with French being the official language and many New Caledonians holding French citizenship. The territory's cultural identity is further shaped by its geographic location, with the Pacific Ocean and surrounding islands playing a significant role in the local way of life.

The official language is French, but many New Caledonians also speak local languages, such as Paicî and Ajië. The cultural influences of New Caledonia are also reflected in its architecture, art, and music, with a mix of traditional and modern styles. The territory's history as a French colony has also left a lasting legacy, with many New Caledonians still maintaining strong ties to France and European culture.

New Caledonia's cultural identity is also shaped by its natural environment, with the territory's unique biodiversity and stunning landscapes playing a significant role in the local way of life. The territory's coral reefs, beaches, and forests are not only important for the local economy, but also hold significant cultural and spiritual value for the Kanak people.
