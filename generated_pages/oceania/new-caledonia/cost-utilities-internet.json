  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in New Caledonia can range from $150 to $300 per month for a medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and provider.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($250 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($50 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: XPF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nNew Caledonia's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity and water during the summer months. The territory's remote location and limited connectivity to the global grid also contribute to higher utility costs. The cost of utilities in New Caledonia is relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in prices over the past few years. However, the cost of electricity is expected to increase in the coming years due to the territory's dependence on imported fossil fuels.\n\nThe seasonal variation in utility costs is mainly due to the tourism industry, which peaks during the summer months. This increased demand for utilities, particularly electricity and water, can lead to higher costs for residents and businesses. Additionally, the territory's tropical climate means that air conditioning and refrigeration are essential, which can drive up electricity costs. To mitigate these costs, residents and businesses can take advantage of energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy sources, such as solar power.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | OPT, Canal+ |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 50-100 Mbps | OPT, Canal+ |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | OPT, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | OPT, Digicel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | OPT, Canal+ |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in New Caledonia, residents typically need to provide proof of address and identification, and pay a deposit to the utility provider.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans are more common and often offer better rates.\n- The best internet providers in New Caledonia are OPT and Canal+, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can take advantage of energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use renewable energy sources like solar power.\n- Residents can also consider bundling their internet and phone services to save on costs.",
