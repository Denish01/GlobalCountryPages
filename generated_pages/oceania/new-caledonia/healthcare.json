  "content": "Healthcare in New Caledonia is generally of a high standard, with a well-organized system and access to quality medical facilities, especially in the capital city of Noumea.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: 4/5\nEmergency Number: 15\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nNew Caledonia's healthcare system is based on the French model, with a mix of public and private providers. The public system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical staff and modern equipment. However, there can be long waiting times for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare providers are also available, and many expats and tourists choose to use these services for quicker access to medical care. In urban areas, such as Noumea, access to healthcare is generally good, with a range of medical facilities and specialists available. In rural areas, access to healthcare can be more limited, with fewer medical facilities and specialists available.\n\nThe quality of care in New Caledonia is generally high, with many medical professionals having received training in France or other European countries. However, there can be some challenges in terms of accessing specialized care, particularly in rural areas. The government of New Caledonia has made efforts to improve access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas, through the development of new medical facilities and the recruitment of more medical staff.\n\nDespite the overall high quality of healthcare in New Caledonia, there are some challenges to be aware of, particularly in terms of accessing medical care in emergency situations. The emergency services number is 15, and ambulance services are generally reliable. However, medical facilities can be some distance away, particularly in rural areas, and evacuation to Noumea or other major centers may be necessary in serious cases.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Centre Hospitalier de Noumea | Noumea | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Clinique de la Baie des Citrons | Noumea | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Hopital de Bourail | Bourail | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Medipole | Noumea | Private | General medicine, surgery, dermatology | Yes |\n| Centre Medical de la Vallée des Colons | La Foa | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinique Magnin | Noumea | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expats, as it can provide access to private medical facilities and specialists.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance policies.\n- **Coverage for expats** is generally available, but may require a separate policy or rider.\n- **Costs** can vary depending on the type of policy and level of coverage, but expect to pay around 500-1000 XPF per month for a basic policy.\n- **International insurance** is also available, and may provide more comprehensive coverage, particularly for emergency evacuations.\n- **French social security** may be available for French citizens and some other EU nationals, but this can be complex and may require registration.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Availability of medications** is generally good, with many common medications available over the counter or by prescription.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many medications require a prescription from a licensed medical practitioner.\n- **Common brands** are often available, but may be more expensive than generic alternatives.\n- **Costs** can vary depending on the medication and pharmacy, but expect to pay around 500-1000 XPF for a standard prescription.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies available in Noumea and other major towns.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include yellow fever, hepatitis A, and typhoid, particularly for travelers from high-risk areas.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis B, rabies, and influenza, particularly for travelers who will be spending time in rural areas or working with animals.\n- **Endemic diseases** include dengue fever, Zika virus, and chikungunya, which can be spread by mosquitoes.\n- **Water safety** is generally good, but it is recommended to drink bottled or filtered water to avoid the risk of water-borne illnesses.\n- **Food safety** is generally good, but it is recommended to avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables to avoid the risk of food-borne illnesses.\n- **Sun protection** is important, as the sun can be strong in New Caledonia, particularly during the summer months.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, dental procedures, and orthopedic surgery, which can be more affordable in New Caledonia than in other countries.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Centre Hospitalier de Noumea and the Clinique de la Baie des Citrons, which have international accreditation and offer high-quality medical care.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with some procedures costing 50-75% less than in other countries.\n- **Language** can be a challenge, as not all medical staff speak English fluently, but many hospitals and clinics have English-speaking staff and interpreters available.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **What to do in an emergency** is to call the emergency services number, 15, or to go to the nearest hospital or medical facility.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, but can be limited in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be some distance away, particularly in rural areas, and evacuation to Noumea or other major centers may be necessary in serious cases.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, and it is recommended to have travel insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations and hospital stays.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in serious cases, and it is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuation, including contact details for insurance providers and emergency services.",
