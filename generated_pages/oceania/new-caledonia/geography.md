New Caledonia is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east, south, and west, and is bordered by the Coral Sea to the north. The territory is located near the Tropic of Capricorn, which gives it a tropical climate.

The islands of New Caledonia are situated about 500 kilometers northwest of Fiji and 350 kilometers east of Vanuatu.

The territory's capital, Noumea, is the largest city and is located on the southwest coast of Grande Terre.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
New Caledonia's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, valleys, and coastal plains. The interior of Grande Terre is dominated by a central mountain range, which includes the highest point, Mont Panié. The mountains are covered in dense rainforests, which are home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. The coastal plains are generally narrow and are lined with coral reefs and white-sand beaches.

The territory's landscape is also marked by several rivers, including the Diahot River, which flows through the capital city of Noumea. The islands are also home to several lakes, including Lake Yaté, which is the largest lake in New Caledonia. The territory's unique geology is characterized by a mix of volcanic and sedimentary rocks, which have been shaped by millions of years of erosion and weathering. The islands are also home to several inactive volcanoes, which are a reminder of the territory's volcanic history.

The coastal areas of New Caledonia are lined with coral reefs, which are home to a wide variety of marine life. The reefs are also an important barrier against storms and erosion, and help to protect the coastal communities.
