[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
New Caledonia is accessible by air, with the main international airport being La Tontouta International Airport (NOU), located about 45 kilometers northwest of Noumea, the capital city. Direct flights are available from major hubs such as Paris, Tokyo, and Sydney, as well as from neighboring Pacific Island nations like Vanuatu and Fiji. There are no overland entry points, as New Caledonia is an island territory. The airport is well-connected to the city center by taxi and bus services, making it easy to get to your destination.

The majority of international flights arrive at La Tontouta International Airport, which is also a hub for domestic flights. The airport has a range of facilities, including restaurants, shops, and currency exchange offices. If you're planning to explore the surrounding islands, you can also take a ferry or a domestic flight from Noumea to other parts of the territory. The **French** influence is evident in the airport's facilities and services, which are generally of a high standard.

New Caledonia has an extensive domestic air network, with flights connecting Noumea to other parts of the territory, including the Isle of Pines, Lifou, and Ouvea. The main domestic airline is **Air Calédonie**, which operates regular flights to these destinations. You can book flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way ticket from Noumea to the Isle of Pines, for example, can cost around $200-$300. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.
