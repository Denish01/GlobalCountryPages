The public healthcare system is generally of good quality and widely accessible to locals, with most medical expenses being covered by the French social security system.

Many medical professionals in New Caledonia are trained in France, ensuring a high standard of care.\n\nThe healthcare system in New Caledonia is well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical centers providing a wide range of medical services. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the first point of contact for medical care, while foreigners may prefer to use private healthcare services. In either case, having some form of health insurance can provide peace of mind and financial protection in case of unexpected medical expenses.
