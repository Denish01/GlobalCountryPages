  "content": "The infrastructure in Solomon Islands is underdeveloped, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 23% of population\nInternet Penetration: 12%\nRoad Network: 1,390 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Solomon Islands face significant challenges in developing its infrastructure, with a lack of investment and limited resources hindering progress. Recent years have seen some investment in infrastructure development, particularly in the transportation sector, with the aim of improving connectivity and facilitating economic growth. However, the urban-rural gap remains a major concern, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has recognized the need to address these disparities and has implemented initiatives to improve infrastructure development in rural areas.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its geographical characteristics, with a large number of islands and a lack of connectivity between them. This makes it challenging to develop and maintain infrastructure, particularly in the transportation sector. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve infrastructure development, with a focus on increasing access to basic services and promoting economic growth.\n\nThe Solomon Islands have also been affected by natural disasters, such as cyclones and floods, which have damaged infrastructure and disrupted services. The government and international organizations have been working to rebuild and improve infrastructure, with a focus on disaster resilience and sustainability. This includes the development of climate-resilient infrastructure, such as sea walls and flood-resistant buildings, to protect communities from the impacts of climate change.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 1,390 km | Poor | mostly unpaved and in need of maintenance |\n| Railways | none | - | - |\n| Airports | 2 international, 19 domestic | Moderate | limited facilities and services |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | well-equipped and efficient |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The Solomon Islands rely heavily on imported diesel and petrol for power generation, with a small proportion of electricity generated from **renewable energy** sources such as hydro and solar power.\n- The country's power grid is unreliable, with frequent **power outages** and disruptions to services.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to increase access to electricity, particularly in rural areas, with a focus on **off-grid** solutions such as solar home systems.\n- The Solomon Islands have significant potential for **renewable energy** development, particularly in the areas of hydro and geothermal power.\n- The government is working to improve the reliability and efficiency of the power grid, with a focus on reducing **energy losses** and increasing the use of renewable energy sources.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **safe drinking water** is a major concern in the Solomon Islands, particularly in rural areas where many communities rely on **rainwater collection** and **unimproved water sources**.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many households lacking access to **improved sanitation facilities** such as toilets and latrines.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve access to water and sanitation, particularly in rural areas, with a focus on **community-based** approaches.\n- The Solomon Islands have significant challenges in terms of **water resource management**, with a lack of data and information on water resources hindering effective management and planning.\n- The government is working to improve **water quality** and reduce the risk of **water-borne diseases**, with a focus on increasing access to **improved water sources** and **sanitation facilities**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile phone coverage** is relatively widespread in the Solomon Islands, with a number of mobile phone operators providing services across the country.\n- **Internet penetration** is limited, with a small proportion of the population having access to **broadband internet** services.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **telecommunications infrastructure**, particularly in rural areas, with a focus on increasing access to **mobile phone** and **internet services**.\n- The Solomon Islands have significant potential for **digital economy** development, particularly in the areas of **e-commerce** and **e-government**.\n- The government is working to improve **cybersecurity** and reduce the risk of **cyber threats**, with a focus on increasing awareness and capacity among **ICT stakeholders**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Solomon Islands government is implementing a number of major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of a new **international airport** and the upgrading of **port facilities**.\n- The government has also implemented initiatives to improve **road infrastructure**, particularly in rural areas, with a focus on increasing access to **markets** and **services**.\n- The Solomon Islands have received significant funding from **international donors** to support infrastructure development, particularly in the areas of **transport** and **energy**.\n- The government is working to improve **disaster resilience** and **sustainability** in infrastructure development, with a focus on **climate-resilient** design and construction.\n- The Solomon Islands are also exploring opportunities for **public-private partnerships** in infrastructure development, particularly in the areas of **energy** and **telecommunications**.",
