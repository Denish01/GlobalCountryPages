  "content": "The cost of education in Solomon Islands varies greatly depending on the type of institution and the level of education, with public primary and secondary schools being largely free or subsidized, while private and international schools can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 8.3%\nLiteracy Rate: 84.1%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 12 months\nCurrency: SBD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Solomon Islands is overseen by the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, with a focus on providing free or subsidized education to all citizens. Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, which are often favored by expatriates and wealthy locals. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from primary 1 to primary 6. There are also several international schools available in the capital city of Honiara, which offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the Australian curriculum.\n\nThe quality of education in Solomon Islands is a significant concern, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. However, there are also several initiatives underway to improve the education system, including the introduction of new curriculum and teacher training programs. Private schools, on the other hand, are generally well-equipped and offer a higher quality of education, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Solomon Islanders.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, large class sizes |\n| Private Primary | $200-$500 | Small class sizes, better resources |\n| Public Secondary | $50-$100 (subsidized) | Limited resources, large class sizes |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$1,000 | Small class sizes, better resources |\n| International School | $2,000-$5,000 | International curriculum, high-quality resources |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited programs, limited resources |\n| Private University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | Small class sizes, better resources |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$2,500 | $2,500-$3,500 | Solomon Islands National University, limited programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability, expensive |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Limited availability, expensive |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability, expensive |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic supplies, limited availability |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for all schools, limited availability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Solomon Islands are generally considered to be the international schools in Honiara, which offer a high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- There are limited scholarship opportunities available for Solomon Islanders, but some universities and organizations offer scholarships for international students.\n- Online learning options are limited in Solomon Islands, but some universities and institutions offer online courses and degree programs.\n- The education quality in Solomon Islands is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, but there are several initiatives underway to improve the education system.\n- Expats and international students should research schools and universities carefully before making a decision, and consider factors such as curriculum, resources, and teacher quality.\n- The Solomon Islands government has introduced several initiatives to improve education, including the introduction of new curriculum and teacher training programs, and the construction of new schools and education facilities.",
