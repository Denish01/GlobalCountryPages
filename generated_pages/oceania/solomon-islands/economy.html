        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>The Solomon Islands has a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $2,070. The country's economy is primarily driven by its natural resources, including fish, timber, and minerals. The Solomon Islands is one of the least developed countries in the Pacific region, with a high dependence on foreign aid and a limited economic base. The country's economic development has been hindered by a number of factors, including a lack of infrastructure, a shortage of skilled labor, and a vulnerable environment.</p>
        <p>The Solomon Islands' economy is classified as a mixed economy, with a combination of traditional and modern sectors. The traditional sector is characterized by subsistence farming and fishing, while the modern sector is driven by the export of natural resources and the growth of the services sector. The country's economic trajectory has been marked by periods of growth and decline, with the economy experiencing a significant decline in the 1990s due to a combination of factors, including a decline in the price of timber and a civil conflict.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, the Solomon Islands' economy has shown signs of growth in recent years, driven by an increase in the price of commodities and a growth in the services sector. The country has also made significant progress in improving its business environment, with the government implementing a number of reforms aimed at attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth.</p>

        <h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
        <p>The Solomon Islands' economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by an increase in the price of commodities and a growth in the services sector.

The government has implemented a number of reforms aimed at attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth, including the establishment of a new investment promotion agency and the introduction of new tax incentives.</p>
        <p>A number of major projects are underway, including the development of a new gold mine and the expansion of the country's forestry sector. The Solomon Islands is also expected to benefit from a number of regional initiatives, including the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) and the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) trade agreement. However, the country's economic outlook is vulnerable to a number of risks, including a decline in the price of commodities and a significant increase in global economic uncertainty. As such, the government will need to continue to implement reforms and invest in key sectors to promote economic growth and development.</p>
