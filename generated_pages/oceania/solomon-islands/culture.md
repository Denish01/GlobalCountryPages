# Solomon Islands Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
The Solomon Islands is a sovereign nation in Oceania, comprising a diverse group of islands with a rich cultural heritage. The country's cultural identity is shaped by its indigenous Melanesian people, as well as influences from European colonizers, Asian traders, and other Pacific Island cultures. The ethnic makeup of the Solomon Islands is predominantly Melanesian, with over 90% of the population identifying as indigenous Solomon Islanders. The official language is English, but there are many local languages spoken throughout the islands, including Pijin, the lingua franca.

The Solomon Islands' cultural identity is characterized by a strong sense of community and traditional values. The concept of **"wantok"** (meaning "one talk" or shared language and culture) is central to Solomon Islander identity, emphasizing the importance of kinship ties, shared language, and cultural practices. The country's cultural landscape is also marked by a history of colonialism, missionary activity, and trade, which have introduced new customs, beliefs, and practices. Today, the Solomon Islands is a multicultural society, with a unique blend of traditional and modern influences.

The Solomon Islands' cultural diversity is reflected in its many languages, customs, and traditional practices. The country is home to over 60 languages, each with its own distinct culture and traditions. The islands' geographic isolation has also contributed to the development of distinct cultural practices, such as the **"kastom"** (custom) system, which governs social relationships, land ownership, and other aspects of community life. Understanding and respecting these cultural practices is essential for visitors to the Solomon Islands.
