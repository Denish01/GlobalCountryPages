[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Solomon Islands are an archipelago with a limited transportation network, and most people rely on **minibuses**, **taxis**, and **boats** to get around. The quality of public transit is relatively poor, with limited coverage and frequent breakdowns. In the capital city of Honiara, there are some **city buses** and **minibuses** that operate on fixed routes, but the service is not very reliable. In the rural areas, people often rely on **walking** or **cycling** to get around, as the roads are often in poor condition and public transportation is scarce.

The main transportation modes in Solomon Islands are **sea transport** and **road transport**, with **air transport** being limited to a few domestic flights. The country has a total of around 1,500 kilometers of roads, but most of them are in poor condition and not suitable for high-speed travel. The sea transport network is more developed, with several **ports** and **harbors** around the country, but the service is often slow and unreliable. Despite these challenges, the Solomon Islands government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, with several **road construction projects** and **port upgrades** underway.
