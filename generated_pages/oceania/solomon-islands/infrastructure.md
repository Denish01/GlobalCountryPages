[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 23% of population
Internet Penetration: 12%
Road Network: 1,390 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 2
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Solomon Islands face significant challenges in developing its infrastructure, with a lack of investment and limited resources hindering progress. Recent years have seen some investment in infrastructure development, particularly in the transportation sector, with the aim of improving connectivity and facilitating economic growth. However, the urban-rural gap remains a major concern, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has recognized the need to address these disparities and has implemented initiatives to improve infrastructure development in rural areas.

The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its geographical characteristics, with a large number of islands and a lack of connectivity between them. This makes it challenging to develop and maintain infrastructure, particularly in the transportation sector. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve infrastructure development, with a focus on increasing access to basic services and promoting economic growth.

The Solomon Islands have also been affected by natural disasters, such as cyclones and floods, which have damaged infrastructure and disrupted services. The government and international organizations have been working to rebuild and improve infrastructure, with a focus on disaster resilience and sustainability. This includes the development of climate-resilient infrastructure, such as sea walls and flood-resistant buildings, to protect communities from the impacts of climate change.
