The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season. The Solomon Islands government has implemented measures to improve the utility infrastructure, including investments in renewable energy and water supply systems. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, particularly those in rural areas.\n\nThe stability of utility costs in Solomon Islands is affected by various factors, including fuel prices, inflation, and government subsidies. The inflation rate in Solomon Islands is around 4.3%, which can impact the cost of utilities and other essential services. Additionally, the country's reliance on imported fuel and other resources can make utility costs vulnerable to fluctuations in global market prices. Despite these challenges, the government and utility providers are working to improve the efficiency and reliability of utility services, including the introduction of prepaid electricity meters and other initiatives to reduce energy consumption.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (bottled gas) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | Our Telekom, Bmobile |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 50-100 Mbps | Our Telekom, Bmobile |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Bmobile, Our Telekom |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Bmobile, Our Telekom |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Our Telekom, Bmobile |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | (available with international credit card) |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | (available with international credit card) |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Our Telekom's streaming service) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Solomon Islands, it is recommended to contact the relevant providers (e.g. Our Telekom, Bmobile, Solomon Power) and provide required documents, such as a copy of your passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Solomon Islands are Our Telekom and Bmobile, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and reducing waste.\n- It is also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure you are getting the best value for your money.",
