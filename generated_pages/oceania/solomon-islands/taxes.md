[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
The Solomon Islands has a **territorial taxation system**, where individuals and businesses are taxed only on income derived from sources within the country. However, residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with credits available for foreign taxes paid. Residency for tax purposes is determined by physical presence in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year, or by being present in the country for an average of at least 91 days per year over a four-year period.

The tax system in Solomon Islands is relatively straightforward, with a focus on simplicity and ease of compliance. The government has implemented various measures to encourage foreign investment and economic growth, including tax incentives for small businesses and foreign investors. The tax authority, the Inland Revenue Division, is responsible for administering and collecting taxes, and provides guidance and support to taxpayers through its website and offices.
