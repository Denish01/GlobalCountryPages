The quality of public transit is relatively poor, with limited coverage and frequent breakdowns. In the capital city of Honiara, there are some **city buses** and **minibuses** that operate on fixed routes, but the service is not very reliable. In the rural areas, people often rely on **walking** or **cycling** to get around, as the roads are often in poor condition and public transportation is scarce.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Solomon Islands are **sea transport** and **road transport**, with **air transport** being limited to a few domestic flights. The country has a total of around 1,500 kilometers of roads, but most of them are in poor condition and not suitable for high-speed travel. The sea transport network is more developed, with several **ports** and **harbors** around the country, but the service is often slow and unreliable. Despite these challenges, the Solomon Islands government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, with several **road construction projects** and **port upgrades** underway.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Limited coverage, frequent breakdowns |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Operates on fixed routes, often overcrowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5-$10 | $1-$2 | $10-$20 | Limited availability, often negotiable |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, often by taxi or private car |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $50-$100 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking facilities |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited frequency, often uncomfortable |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, limited availability |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **minibuses** or **city buses** instead of taxis.\n- Negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before you start your journey, as the meters are often not used.\n- Be careful when using **boats** or **ferries**, as the sea conditions can be rough and the safety standards may not be high.\n- Consider renting a **car** for a day or two to explore the surrounding areas, but be aware that the roads can be in poor condition.\n- Use reputable **taxi companies** or **car rental agencies** to avoid any potential safety risks.\n- Always wear a **seatbelt** and follow **traffic rules** to ensure your safety on the road.",
