  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Solomon Islands varies depending on the type of service and provider, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources, while private healthcare is more expensive but offers better facilities and care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $111\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 3.2%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911 or 999\nInsurance Required: No, but recommended for foreigners and those seeking private care\nCurrency: SBD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Solomon Islands is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, but often lacks in quality and resources, with limited access to specialist care and modern medical equipment. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better facilities and care, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those with the means may opt for private care. Insurance is not required, but it is highly recommended for foreigners and those seeking private care, as medical costs can quickly add up.\n\nThe healthcare system in Solomon Islands is also influenced by the country's geography, with many rural areas lacking access to basic medical care. As a result, many people in these areas rely on traditional medicine and home remedies, or travel long distances to access healthcare services. For foreigners, it is essential to have a good understanding of the healthcare system and to have adequate insurance coverage to ensure access to quality care. Additionally, many private healthcare providers in Solomon Islands have partnerships with international hospitals and medical centers, allowing for referrals and evacuations in case of emergency.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have long wait times, while private clinics offer more prompt service |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$250 | Specialist care is limited in public hospitals, while private clinics may have more experienced doctors |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics offer more modern equipment and a wider range of services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment and a wider selection of eyewear |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private labs may offer faster turnaround times and more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have limited resources and long wait times, while private hospitals offer more prompt service |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations and better care |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons and better equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals offer more modern facilities and better care for mothers and newborns |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may have more advanced equipment and faster turnaround times |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Private hospitals may have more modern equipment and faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays, but may have limited coverage for specialist care and evacuations |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$250 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist care, hospital stays, and evacuations, but may have higher premiums and deductibles |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical services worldwide, including evacuations and repatriations, but may have higher premiums and deductibles |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available at pharmacies and clinics, with prices ranging from $5-$20 per prescription\n- Prescription rules are relatively lax, with many medications available over-the-counter\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, including basics such as painkillers and antacids\n- Some pharmacies may offer delivery services or online ordering, but this is not common\n- Credit card acceptance and insurance coverage may vary depending on the pharmacy or clinic\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 911 or 999, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic.
