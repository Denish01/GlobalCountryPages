[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The Solomon Islands have a relatively small population, with a total area of 28,896 km², resulting in a low population density. The population has been growing steadily over the years, with a growth rate of 2.1%, primarily driven by a high fertility rate of 4.1 children per woman. The majority of the population, around 75%, resides in rural areas, with the remaining 25% living in urban centers. The capital city, Honiara, is the largest urban center, accounting for a significant proportion of the urban population. The Solomon Islands have a relatively young population, with a median age of 20.4 years, and a life expectancy of 69 years.

The population growth trend in the Solomon Islands is expected to continue, with the population projected to reach 1 million by 2030. The urban population is also expected to increase, driven by rural-urban migration, as people seek better economic opportunities and access to services. However, this migration trend also poses challenges, such as strain on urban infrastructure and services. The government has implemented policies to address these challenges, including investments in urban planning, housing, and social services.

The Solomon Islands have a unique cultural context, with a mix of traditional and modern practices. The population is predominantly rural, with many people engaged in subsistence farming and fishing. However, the country is also experiencing rapid modernization, with increasing access to education, healthcare, and technology. This has led to changes in population trends, including a decline in fertility rates and an increase in urbanization.
