[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Solomon Islands is relatively small, with a limited supply of modern apartments and houses, particularly in the capital city of Honiara. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are governed by the Solomon Islands' **Tenancy Act**, which provides some protection for renters, but the market is still largely **unregulated**. Compared to regional neighbors like Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, housing costs in Solomon Islands are relatively moderate, with prices influenced by the country's **remote location** and limited economic development.

The housing market in Solomon Islands is also affected by the country's **growing population** and **urbanization**, which has led to an increase in demand for housing, particularly in urban areas. However, the supply of housing has not kept pace with demand, leading to **rental price increases** and a shortage of affordable housing options. Despite these challenges, the Solomon Islands government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the development of new housing estates and the provision of **affordable housing** options for low-income families.
