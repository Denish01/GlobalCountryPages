[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Solomon Islands is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, but often lacks in quality and resources, with limited access to specialist care and modern medical equipment. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better facilities and care, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those with the means may opt for private care. Insurance is not required, but it is highly recommended for foreigners and those seeking private care, as medical costs can quickly add up.

The healthcare system in Solomon Islands is also influenced by the country's geography, with many rural areas lacking access to basic medical care. As a result, many people in these areas rely on traditional medicine and home remedies, or travel long distances to access healthcare services. For foreigners, it is essential to have a good understanding of the healthcare system and to have adequate insurance coverage to ensure access to quality care. Additionally, many private healthcare providers in Solomon Islands have partnerships with international hospitals and medical centers, allowing for referrals and evacuations in case of emergency.
