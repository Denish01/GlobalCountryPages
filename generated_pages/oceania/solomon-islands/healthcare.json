The public healthcare system is the main provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. The private sector also plays a significant role in the healthcare system, with several private hospitals and clinics, especially in the capital city of Honiara. Despite efforts to improve healthcare services, the country still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, limited access to specialized care, and a high burden of infectious diseases.\n\nThe quality of care in Solomon Islands is generally considered to be basic, with limited access to specialized services and a high reliance on traditional medicine, especially in rural areas. The public healthcare system is often under-resourced and under-staffed, which can result in long waiting times and limited access to essential medications and equipment. However, there are some private hospitals and clinics that offer higher-quality care, especially in Honiara, although these services are often expensive and out of reach for many locals.\n\nThe Solomon Islands government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health plan and the establishment of a health insurance scheme. However, more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system, including the shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, the limited access to specialized care, and the high burden of infectious diseases.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Referral Hospital | Honiara | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Honiara Private Hospital | Honiara | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Gizo Hospital | Gizo | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Auki Hospital | Auki | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Taro Hospital | Taro | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Good Samaritan Hospital | Tetere | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expats, as it can provide access to higher-quality care and specialized services.\n- Local insurance options are limited, but some private hospitals and clinics offer their own insurance schemes.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** is available from international providers, which can provide coverage for medical evacuations and repatriations.\n- The cost of health insurance can vary significantly, depending on the provider, level of coverage, and individual circumstances.\n- It is essential to research and compares different insurance options to find the best coverage for your needs and budget.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, so it is worth checking with your employer to see what options are available.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are available at pharmacies and hospitals, although the range of medications can be limited, especially in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but some medications may require a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional.\n- Common brands of medications are available, although the availability of **generic medications** can be limited.\n- The cost of medications can vary significantly, depending on the type, brand, and location.\n- It is essential to bring any essential medications with you when traveling to Solomon Islands, as they may not be available locally.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Solomon Islands.\n- **Malaria** is a significant health risk in Solomon Islands, and travelers should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Dengue fever** and **zika virus** are also present in the country, and travelers should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water and stick to bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat, seafood, and vegetables.\n- **Tuberculosis** is a significant health risk in Solomon Islands, and travelers should take precautions to avoid close contact with people who have the disease.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Solomon Islands, although some private hospitals and clinics may offer specialized services.\n- **Dental care** is available at some private clinics, although the range of services can be limited.\n- **Cosmetic surgery** is not commonly available in Solomon Islands, and travelers may need to seek treatment in other countries.\n- The cost of medical services can vary significantly, depending on the provider, level of care, and individual circumstances.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an emergency, travelers should call **911 or 988** for assistance.\n- **Ambulance services** are available in some areas, although the response time can be slow, especially in rural areas.\n- Travelers should have a plan in place for emergency situations, including a list of emergency contact numbers and a plan for medical evacuation if necessary.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted as soon as possible after an emergency, and travelers should keep all receipts and documentation for medical expenses.\n- Travelers should also be aware of the **nearest hospital** and have a plan for getting there in an emergency.",
