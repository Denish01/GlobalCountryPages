[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Solomon Islands is overseen by the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, with a focus on providing free or subsidized education to all citizens. Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, which are often favored by expatriates and wealthy locals. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 6 years, from primary 1 to primary 6. There are also several international schools available in the capital city of Honiara, which offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the Australian curriculum.

The quality of education in Solomon Islands is a significant concern, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. However, there are also several initiatives underway to improve the education system, including the introduction of new curriculum and teacher training programs. Private schools, on the other hand, are generally well-equipped and offer a higher quality of education, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Solomon Islanders.
