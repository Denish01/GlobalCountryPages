[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Kiribati is an archipelago with limited transportation options, and the quality of public transit varies greatly between the capital city of Tarawa and the outer islands. The most common mode of transportation is by **minibus** or **shared taxi**, which can be flagged down on the side of the road. The roads in Tarawa are generally in good condition, but the traffic can be chaotic, especially during peak hours. In the outer islands, the roads are often unpaved and can be rough, making it difficult to get around.

The majority of the population relies on **bicycles** or **walking** as their primary mode of transportation, especially in the outer islands where public transportation is limited. The government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of new public transportation services. However, the lack of transportation options can make it difficult for tourists and locals alike to get around, especially in the more remote areas.
