The market is largely driven by local demand, with a small but growing expatriate community. Prices have been relatively stable in recent years, with some fluctuations due to factors such as climate change and economic development. The urban areas, such as Tarawa and Betio, tend to have higher property prices compared to rural areas, where land is more readily available but amenities and services may be limited. The Kiribati government has implemented initiatives to develop the country's infrastructure and economy, which may lead to increased demand for property in the future.\n\nThe property market in Kiribati is also influenced by the country's unique cultural and environmental context. The **i-Kiribati** people have a strong traditional connection to the land, and the concept of land ownership is closely tied to family and community ties. As a result, the buying and selling of property can be a complex and nuanced process, requiring a deep understanding of local customs and protocols. Additionally, the country's vulnerability to climate change and rising sea levels poses a significant risk to property owners and investors, who must carefully consider the long-term sustainability of their investments.\n\nOverall, the property market in Kiribati presents both opportunities and challenges for investors and buyers. While the market is relatively small and limited, there is potential for growth and development, particularly in areas such as tourism and renewable energy. However, buyers and investors must be aware of the unique cultural and environmental context of the country, and take steps to ensure that their investments are sustainable and responsible.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tarawa | 1,500 | 200 | Residential |\n| Betio | 1,200 | 150 | Residential |\n| Abaiang | 800 | 100 | Residential |\n| Teinainano | 600 | 80 | Rural |\n| Tabiteuea | 500 | 60 | Rural |\n| Onotoa | 400 | 50 | Rural |\n| Kuria | 300 | 40 | Rural |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Kiribati, but they must obtain a **foreign investment approval** from the Kiribati government.\n- Foreigners are restricted from buying property in certain areas, such as **conservation zones** and **traditional land**.\n- Foreigners can establish a **local company** to purchase property, but the company must be registered with the Kiribati authorities and meet certain requirements.\n- Foreigners must obtain a **leasehold agreement** from the landowner, which can be for a maximum of 50 years.\n- Foreigners must comply with all relevant **laws and regulations**, including those related to land use, planning, and environmental protection.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
