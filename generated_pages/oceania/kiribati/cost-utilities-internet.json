The cost of utilities in Kiribati can be unstable and may fluctuate due to factors such as fuel price changes and weather conditions. For example, during the dry season, water prices may increase due to scarcity, while during the wet season, electricity prices may rise due to increased demand for powering water pumps.\n\nThe government of Kiribati has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the installation of new solar-powered electricity systems and the expansion of water supply networks. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant challenge for many households, particularly those in rural areas. To mitigate these costs, some households rely on traditional methods such as rainwater harvesting and fuel-efficient cooking stoves.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | Based on 200 kWh/month consumption |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | Based on 10 cubic meters/month consumption |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | LPG cylinder prices |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Kiribati Telecommunications Authority (KTA) |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $70-100 | 60 Mbps | KTA, Telecom Services Kiribati (TSK) |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | TSK, KTA |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | TSK, KTA |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | TSK, KTA |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | Available with international credit card |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | Available with international credit card |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Limited content available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the Kiribati Telecommunications Authority (KTA) or Telecom Services Kiribati (TSK) for internet and phone services, and the Public Utilities Board (PUB) for electricity and water services.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget their energy consumption.\n- The best internet providers in Kiribati are KTA and TSK, which offer a range of plans and packages.\n- To save on utility bills, households can use energy-efficient appliances, harvest rainwater, and use **solar-powered** systems to reduce their reliance on the grid.\n- It is also recommended to regularly check and maintain utility meters to ensure accuracy and avoid **disconnections**.",
