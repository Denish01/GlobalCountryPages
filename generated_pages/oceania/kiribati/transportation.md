[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Kiribati is a remote island nation, and the main entry point is **Bonriki International Airport**, which is located on the atoll of Tarawa. The airport receives direct flights from **Nadi** in Fiji, **Honolulu** in Hawaii, and **Brisbane** in Australia, as well as connections from other Pacific island nations. If you're coming from **Europe** or **North America**, you'll likely need to fly to **Fiji** or **Australia** first and then connect to Kiribati.

Overland entry points do not exist in Kiribati, as it is an archipelago of islands surrounded by ocean. The country is not connected to any other landmass, and the only way to arrive is by air or sea. If you're arriving by sea, you'll need to clear customs and immigration at the port of entry, which is usually **Betio** on the atoll of Tarawa.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The domestic air network in Kiribati is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between the main islands. **Air Kiribati** is the national carrier, and it operates flights to most of the outer islands, including **Abaiang**, **Abemama**, and **Butaritari**. You can book flights online or through a local travel agent, and prices are around $100-$200 USD for a one-way ticket. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as flights can be irregular and often fully booked.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in Kiribati, as the country is a small island nation with limited infrastructure. The only way to get around is by air, sea, or road, and even then, options are limited. If you're looking for an alternative to flying, you can take a ferry or a boat to travel between islands, but this can be a slow and unreliable option.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are no intercity bus companies in Kiribati, and the only way to get around on the main island of Tarawa is by taxi or private car. However, there are some **minibus services** that operate on a limited schedule, connecting the main towns and villages on Tarawa. These services are not always reliable, and it's a good idea to check the schedule in advance or negotiate a private transfer with a local driver.
