  "content": "To get around in Kiribati, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, and taxis, as well as drive yourself with a rental car, but be prepared for limited transportation options and poor road conditions.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Bonriki International Airport, TRW\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nKiribati is a remote island nation, and the main entry point is **Bonriki International Airport**, which is located on the atoll of Tarawa. The airport receives direct flights from **Nadi** in Fiji, **Honolulu** in Hawaii, and **Brisbane** in Australia, as well as connections from other Pacific island nations. If you're coming from **Europe** or **North America**, you'll likely need to fly to **Fiji** or **Australia** first and then connect to Kiribati.\n\nOverland entry points do not exist in Kiribati, as it is an archipelago of islands surrounded by ocean. The country is not connected to any other landmass, and the only way to arrive is by air or sea. If you're arriving by sea, you'll need to clear customs and immigration at the port of entry, which is usually **Betio** on the atoll of Tarawa.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in Kiribati is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between the main islands. **Air Kiribati** is the national carrier, and it operates flights to most of the outer islands, including **Abaiang**, **Abemama**, and **Butaritari**. You can book flights online or through a local travel agent, and prices are around $100-$200 USD for a one-way ticket. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as flights can be irregular and often fully booked.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in Kiribati, as the country is a small island nation with limited infrastructure. The only way to get around is by air, sea, or road, and even then, options are limited. If you're looking for an alternative to flying, you can take a ferry or a boat to travel between islands, but this can be a slow and unreliable option.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThere are no intercity bus companies in Kiribati, and the only way to get around on the main island of Tarawa is by taxi or private car. However, there are some **minibus services** that operate on a limited schedule, connecting the main towns and villages on Tarawa. These services are not always reliable, and it's a good idea to check the schedule in advance or negotiate a private transfer with a local driver.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Tarawa | $1-$2 | Limited schedule and routes |\n| Taxi | Tarawa, outer islands | $5-$10/km | Metered fares, but can be negotiated |\n| Ride-Hailing | Tarawa | $5-$10 | Local apps and services available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Not available | - | - |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Kiribati, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a local permit, which can be obtained from the **Ministry of Transport**.\n- Road conditions in Kiribati are poor, with many unpaved roads and limited signage.\n- Fuel costs are high, due to the remote location of the country and the lack of local refineries.\n- Car rental options are limited, but you can hire a car or a scooter from a local company, such as **Kiribati Car Rentals**.\n- Hazards on the road include **potholes**, ** livestock**, and **unmarked speed bumps**, so it's essential to drive slowly and carefully.\n- It's also a good idea to **check the weather forecast** before driving, as heavy rainfall and flooding can make roads impassable.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a taxi, as meters are not always used.\n- Be prepared for **delays and cancellations** of flights and ferry services, due to weather conditions or mechanical issues.\n- **Download local apps**, such as **Tara** or **Kiribati Taxi**, to book taxis or private transfers.\n- **Bring cash**, as credit card facilities are limited, especially outside of Tarawa.\n- **Respect local customs** and traditions, especially when traveling to outer islands.\n- **Learn some basic Gilbertese phrases**, such as **\"Mauri\"** (hello) and **\"Ko na mauri\"** (goodbye), to show respect for the local culture.\n- **Be aware of your surroundings**, especially at night, and take necessary precautions to ensure your safety.\n- **Check the latest travel advisories** before traveling to Kiribati, as the country is vulnerable to **climate change** and **natural disasters**.",
