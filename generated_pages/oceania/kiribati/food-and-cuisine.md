[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Kiribati's cuisine is shaped by its **Pacific Island** location, with a focus on fresh seafood, coconuts, and root vegetables like taro and breadfruit. The country's culinary traditions have been influenced by its history of British colonization, as well as its cultural exchange with neighboring islands. As a result, Kiribati's dishes often feature a mix of local and foreign flavors, with popular ingredients like fish, coconut milk, and **pandanus** leaves. Regional variations exist, with the northern islands tend to have more access to fresh seafood, while the southern islands rely more on root vegetables and imported goods.

The **I-Kiribati** people take great pride in their traditional cuisine, which is often served at special occasions and celebrations. The preparation of meals is a communal effort, with family members and friends gathering to share in the cooking and eating process. This sense of community and sharing is a key aspect of Kiribati's food culture, and visitors are often welcomed with open arms and invited to join in the feasting.

Kiribati's cuisine is also characterized by its use of **umwa**, a type of underground oven that is used to cook a variety of dishes, including **babai** (steamed taro and fish) and **bwabwai** (steamed breadfruit and coconut cream). The use of umwa is an important part of Kiribati's culinary traditions, and is often used to cook meals for special occasions.
