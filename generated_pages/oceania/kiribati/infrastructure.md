# Kiribati Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Kiribati is relatively underdeveloped, with limited access to electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural areas, although recent investments have been made to improve the situation.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 70% of population
Internet Penetration: 15%
Road Network: 670 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Kiribati's infrastructure is still in the early stages of development, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country's remote location and limited resources have hindered the development of its infrastructure, but recent investments from international donors have helped to improve the situation. The government has prioritized the development of essential infrastructure, including roads, ports, and energy generation, to support economic growth and improve living standards. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant challenges facing the country, including climate change, which poses a major threat to Kiribati's infrastructure and very existence.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge for Kiribati. Tarawa, the capital, has relatively better infrastructure, including paved roads, a port, and access to electricity and water. In contrast, rural areas lack basic infrastructure, including roads, healthcare facilities, and access to clean water and sanitation. The government has recognized the need to address this gap and has implemented initiatives to improve infrastructure in rural areas, including the construction of new roads and the extension of electricity and water services.

Despite these challenges, Kiribati has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, ports, and energy generation facilities. The country has also made efforts to improve its disaster resilience, including the development of early warning systems and emergency response plans. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant infrastructure challenges facing the country.

[/TABLE]

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- The main source of power generation is diesel, which is imported from abroad, making it expensive and unreliable.
- The electricity grid is limited, with only 70% of the population having access to electricity, mostly in urban areas.
- Power outages are frequent, particularly during peak hours, due to the limited capacity of the grid.
- Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are being explored, with several pilot projects underway to reduce the country's reliance on imported diesel.
- The government has set a target to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix to 50% by 2030.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- Access to clean water is a significant challenge, particularly in rural areas, where many communities rely on rainwater collection and traditional wells.
- Tap water is not always safe to drink, and many households rely on bottled or filtered water for drinking.
- Sanitation coverage is limited, with only 30% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.
- The government has implemented initiatives to improve access to clean water and sanitation, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sanitation facilities.
- Climate change poses a significant threat to Kiribati's water resources, with rising sea levels and increased flooding contaminating freshwater sources.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- Mobile phone coverage is limited, with only 15% of the population having access to internet services.
- Fiber-optic cables have been laid to connect the country to the global network, but the rollout of broadband services has been slow.
- 4G services are available in some areas, but the coverage is limited.
- Postal services are available, but mail delivery can be slow and unreliable.
- The government has recognized the importance of telecommunications in supporting economic development and has implemented initiatives to improve access to internet and mobile phone services.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The Kiribati Road Improvement Project, funded by the Asian Development Bank, aims to improve the condition of the country's roads and increase access to rural areas.
- The Tarawa Port Development Project, funded by the World Bank, aims to improve the capacity and facilities of the port, including the construction of a new wharf and cargo handling facilities.
- The Renewable Energy Development Project, funded by the European Union, aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and reduce the country's reliance on imported diesel.
- The Water and Sanitation Improvement Project, funded by the Australian government, aims to improve access to clean water and sanitation in rural areas.
- The Telecommunications Development Project, funded by the International Telecommunication Union, aims to improve access to internet and mobile phone services, including the rollout of broadband services and the expansion of mobile phone coverage.
