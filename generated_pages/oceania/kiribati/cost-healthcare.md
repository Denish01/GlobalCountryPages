[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Kiribati has a public healthcare system that provides free or low-cost medical services to its citizens, with a focus on primary healthcare and preventative measures. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of adequate quality, although it may face challenges in terms of resources and infrastructure. For foreigners, the public healthcare system may not provide the same level of quality or services as private healthcare providers, and it is recommended that they have health insurance that covers them for medical treatment in Kiribati or evacuation to a neighboring country with better medical facilities. The healthcare system in Kiribati is generally divided into two tiers: public and private, with the public system being the primary provider of healthcare services to the local population.

The public healthcare system in Kiribati is funded by the government and provides a range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries. However, the public system may have limited resources and equipment, and may not be able to provide the same level of care as private healthcare providers. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a range of services, including specialist consultations, dental care, and eye exams, but these services are generally more expensive than those provided by the public system. It is recommended that foreigners have health insurance that covers them for medical treatment in Kiribati, as the cost of private healthcare services can be high.
