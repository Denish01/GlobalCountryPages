The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of adequate quality, although it may face challenges in terms of resources and infrastructure. For foreigners, the public healthcare system may not provide the same level of quality or services as private healthcare providers, and it is recommended that they have health insurance that covers them for medical treatment in Kiribati or evacuation to a neighboring country with better medical facilities. The healthcare system in Kiribati is generally divided into two tiers: public and private, with the public system being the primary provider of healthcare services to the local population.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Kiribati is funded by the government and provides a range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries. However, the public system may have limited resources and equipment, and may not be able to provide the same level of care as private healthcare providers. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a range of services, including specialist consultations, dental care, and eye exams, but these services are generally more expensive than those provided by the public system. It is recommended that foreigners have health insurance that covers them for medical treatment in Kiribati, as the cost of private healthcare services can be high.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public clinics may have limited hours and services |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private specialist consultations may require a referral from a GP |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private dental clinics may offer a wider range of services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private optometrists may offer more comprehensive eye exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer a wider range of tests and faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations and better services |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may offer more specialized surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$300 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may offer more advanced diagnostic services |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Private hospitals may offer faster and more convenient X-ray services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic surgeries |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Specialist consultations, dental care, eye exams, and more comprehensive surgical services |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Medical evacuation, international hospital stays, and more comprehensive medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics may cost between $5-$10 per prescription\n- Prescription medications may require a doctor's prescription and may be available at public or private pharmacies\n- Pharmacy availability may be limited in rural areas, and it is recommended to stock up on essential medications\n- Over-the-counter medications such as cold and flu medications may be available at pharmacies and general stores\n- The cost of medications may vary depending on the type and brand, and it is recommended to check prices before purchasing\n- It is also recommended to bring any essential medications with you when traveling to Kiribati, as availability may be limited\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 911 or 192 for police, 193 for fire, and 194 for ambulance.
