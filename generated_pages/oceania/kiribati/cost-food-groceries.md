[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Kiribati are generally higher compared to other countries in the region due to the island nation's remote location and limited access to fresh produce. The cost of importing goods, including food, drives prices up, making it challenging for locals and tourists to afford basic necessities. The eating-out culture is not as prevalent in Kiribati as it is in other countries, with many locals opting to cook at home due to the high cost of dining out. However, there are some affordable options available, including traditional I-Kiribati dishes such as **coconut crab** and **fresh fish**.

The inflation rate in Kiribati, which stands at 2.5% as of 2024, also affects food prices, causing them to fluctuate over time. Additionally, the limited availability of certain food items, particularly fresh produce, can drive up prices. Despite these challenges, the Kiribati government has implemented initiatives to improve food security and reduce reliance on imports, including promoting local agriculture and fishing industries. These efforts aim to increase the availability of fresh, locally sourced produce, which can help reduce food prices and improve the overall quality of life for locals.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, there is a significant price difference between supermarkets and local markets in Kiribati. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive due to the high cost of importing goods, while local markets offer fresher produce at lower prices. However, the selection at local markets can be limited, and the quality of the produce may vary. It is recommended to buy fresh produce, such as **fruits** and **vegetables**, at local markets, while opting for supermarkets for imported goods like **canned goods** and **dairy products**.

Bargaining is not a common practice in Kiribati, and prices are generally fixed. However, it is possible to negotiate prices at local markets, particularly when buying in bulk. When shopping at local markets, it is essential to be respectful of the vendors and the local culture. It is also important to note that some local markets may not accept credit or debit cards, so it is recommended to have cash on hand.
