The cost of importing goods, including food, drives prices up, making it challenging for locals and tourists to afford basic necessities. The eating-out culture is not as prevalent in Kiribati as it is in other countries, with many locals opting to cook at home due to the high cost of dining out. However, there are some affordable options available, including traditional I-Kiribati dishes such as **coconut crab** and **fresh fish**.\n\nThe inflation rate in Kiribati, which stands at 2.5% as of 2024, also affects food prices, causing them to fluctuate over time. Additionally, the limited availability of certain food items, particularly fresh produce, can drive up prices. Despite these challenges, the Kiribati government has implemented initiatives to improve food security and reduce reliance on imports, including promoting local agriculture and fishing industries. These efforts aim to increase the availability of fresh, locally sourced produce, which can help reduce food prices and improve the overall quality of life for locals.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 3.75 AUD | Imported from Australia |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.00 | 3.00 AUD | Locally baked |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $3.00 | 4.50 AUD | Imported from Fiji |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50 | 2.25 AUD | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 9.00 AUD | Imported from Australia |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 15.00 AUD | Imported from Australia |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 7.50 AUD | Imported from New Zealand |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3.50 | 5.25 AUD | Locally grown |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 3.75 AUD | Locally grown |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $2.00 | 3.00 AUD | Imported from Fiji |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 12.00 AUD | Limited availability |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.50 | 2.25 AUD | Locally bottled |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | Traditional I-Kiribati dishes |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | One person, limited menu |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | 3 courses, moderate prices |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | Upscale, limited options |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | Limited availability |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | Widely available |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | Limited coffee culture |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | Widely available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, there is a significant price difference between supermarkets and local markets in Kiribati.

However, it is possible to negotiate prices at local markets, particularly when buying in bulk. When shopping at local markets, it is essential to be respectful of the vendors and the local culture. It is also important to note that some local markets may not accept credit or debit cards, so it is recommended to have cash on hand.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eat at local eateries or food stalls, which offer traditional I-Kiribati dishes at affordable prices\n- Buy fresh produce at local markets to support local farmers and reduce costs\n- Opt for locally sourced fish and seafood, which is widely available and affordable\n- Avoid buying imported goods, which can be expensive and may not be fresh\n- Try traditional I-Kiribati dishes, such as **coconut crab** and **fresh fish**, which are delicious and affordable\n- Consider buying in bulk and preserving food to reduce waste and save money",
