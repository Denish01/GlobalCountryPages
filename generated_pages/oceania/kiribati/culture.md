# Kiribati Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Kiribati's culture is a unique blend of traditional and modern influences, shaped by its history as a British colony and its geographical location in the Pacific Ocean. The country's cultural identity is defined by its indigenous Micronesian heritage, with a strong emphasis on community, respect for elders, and a deep connection to the land and the sea. The majority of the population is of Micronesian descent, with a small minority of Europeans and Asians. The official languages are English and **Gilbertese**, also known as **Te Taetae ni Kiribati**, which is the most widely spoken language in the country.

The cultural makeup of Kiribati is characterized by a strong sense of community and social harmony, with a focus on cooperation and mutual respect. The traditional Kiribati way of life is centered around the **maneaba**, a community house where people gather to discuss important issues, share stories, and socialize. The **maneaba** is an integral part of Kiribati culture, serving as a symbol of community and social bonding. The country's cultural identity is also influenced by its Christian heritage, with the majority of the population practicing Christianity.

Kiribati's cultural identity is also reflected in its traditional arts and crafts, such as woodcarving, weaving, and tattooing. The country's unique cultural heritage is a result of its historical isolation and its geographical location, which has allowed it to maintain its distinct cultural identity despite external influences. The Kiribati people take great pride in their cultural heritage, and visitors can experience this firsthand by attending traditional ceremonies and festivals, visiting cultural centers, and interacting with the local community.
