The most common mode of transportation is by **minibus** or **shared taxi**, which can be flagged down on the side of the road. The roads in Tarawa are generally in good condition, but the traffic can be chaotic, especially during peak hours. In the outer islands, the roads are often unpaved and can be rough, making it difficult to get around.\n\nThe majority of the population relies on **bicycles** or **walking** as their primary mode of transportation, especially in the outer islands where public transportation is limited. The government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of new public transportation services. However, the lack of transportation options can make it difficult for tourists and locals alike to get around, especially in the more remote areas.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1 | $20 | Limited coverage, mostly in Tarawa |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Routes vary, mostly in Tarawa |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$20 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, by taxi or minibus |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $50-$100 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mostly by minibus |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, e.g. Tarawa to Christmas Island |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- **Negotiate taxi fares** before you start your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- **Use minibus or shared taxi** services for a more affordable and convenient way to get around.\n- **Bicycles** are a great way to get around Tarawa and the outer islands, and can be rented for a low cost.\n- **Be prepared for rough roads** and limited transportation options in the outer islands.\n- **Plan ahead** and research your transportation options before arriving in Kiribati, as they can be limited.\n- **Consider purchasing a local SIM card** to help you stay connected and navigate the transportation system.",
