The country is further divided into six councils of islands, each with its own local government. The administrative structure of Kiribati is relatively simple, with the capital city of Tarawa serving as the central hub for government, economy, and culture. The island groups and councils work together to manage the country's resources, provide services to the population, and promote sustainable development.\n\nThe division of Kiribati into island groups and councils is largely based on geographical and historical factors. The Gilbert Islands, for example, are the most populous and economically developed group, while the Line Islands and Phoenix Islands are more remote and less populated. This division has helped to promote a sense of community and cooperation among the islanders, while also allowing for more effective management of the country's resources and services.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Tarawa** (45,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Tarawa is the largest city in Kiribati and serves as the country's capital, with a rich history and culture.

The most common mode of transportation is by boat, with regular ferry services connecting the main islands. Domestic flights are also available, with Air Kiribati operating regular flights between Tarawa and the outer islands. There are no trains or buses in Kiribati, and driving conditions can be difficult due to the lack of paved roads. However, many visitors find that the best way to experience the country is by walking or cycling, which allows for a more intimate connection with the local culture and environment.\n\n[CALLOUT] Visitors to Kiribati should be aware that transportation options may be limited, and it's a good idea to plan ahead and book in advance to ensure availability. Additionally, the country's remote location and limited infrastructure can make it difficult to access some areas, so it's essential to be flexible and patient when traveling in Kiribati.",
