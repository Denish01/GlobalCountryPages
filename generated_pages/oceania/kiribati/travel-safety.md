[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Kiribati is generally a safe country to visit, with low crime rates and a strong sense of community. The country has a small population and a relatively simple way of life, which contributes to its safety. However, as with any travel destination, it's essential to take normal precautions to ensure your safety. The risk of petty crime, such as theft and pickpocketing, is low, but it's still important to be mindful of your belongings, especially in crowded areas. The risk of violent crime is also low, but it's not unheard of, so it's crucial to be aware of your surroundings and avoid walking alone in isolated areas at night.

The main safety concerns in Kiribati are related to natural disasters, such as cyclones and flooding, which can occur due to the country's location in the Pacific Ocean. The health risk is moderate, with a risk of diseases such as dengue fever and Zika virus. It's essential to take necessary precautions, such as using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing, to minimize the risk of contracting these diseases. Additionally, the medical facilities in Kiribati are limited, so it's crucial to have adequate health insurance and to be prepared for emergency situations.
