[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Kiribati is a small island nation with a developing economy, classified as a low-income country. The country's economy is primarily driven by fishing, copra production, and tourism. The economy has been growing slowly over the years, with a GDP growth rate of around 2-3% per annum. However, the country faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited economic diversification, and a high dependence on foreign aid. Kiribati's economy is also highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising sea levels and increased frequency of natural disasters posing a significant threat to the country's long-term sustainability.

The country's economic development is also hindered by its remote location, limited access to markets, and a lack of skilled labor. Despite these challenges, the government of Kiribati has been working to promote economic development, including efforts to improve the business environment, increase investment in infrastructure, and promote economic diversification. The country has also been working to develop its tourism industry, with a focus on eco-tourism and sustainable tourism practices.

The economy of Kiribati is also heavily reliant on remittances from citizens living abroad, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. These remittances provide a significant source of income for many families in Kiribati and help to support the country's economy. However, the country's economic growth and development are also closely tied to the global economy, and the country is vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global commodity prices and economic downturns in key trading partners.
