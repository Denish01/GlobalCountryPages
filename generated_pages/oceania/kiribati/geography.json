It is part of the region of Oceania and is composed of 33 coral atolls, spread over a vast area of approximately 3.5 million square kilometers. The country is bordered by the Marshall Islands to the northwest and Nauru to the southwest, with the Pacific Ocean surrounding it on all sides.\n\nThe location of Kiribati makes it a unique and remote destination, with the nearest major landmass being over 1,000 kilometers away. The country's geography is characterized by a chain of islands that stretch from the equator to just south of the equator, with the capital city of Tarawa being the largest urban center. The surrounding ocean is home to a diverse range of marine life, including coral reefs, fish, and other sea creatures.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe terrain of Kiribati is generally flat, with the highest point being Banaba, which rises to an elevation of just 81 meters above sea level. The islands are coral atolls, formed from the remains of ancient volcanoes that have been eroded over time, leaving behind a ring of coral reefs and sandy beaches. The interior of the islands is often densely vegetated, with coconut trees, pandanus, and other tropical plants being common.\n\nThe coastline of Kiribati is characterized by white sandy beaches, crystal-clear lagoons, and coral reefs that are home to a diverse range of marine life. The islands are also dotted with small lakes and ponds, which are often used for fishing and other aquatic activities. The terrain and landscape of Kiribati are relatively untouched, with much of the country remaining in its natural state.\n\nThe islands of Kiribati are also home to a number of unique geological features, including the **Phoenix Islands**, which are a chain of islands that are known for their pristine coral reefs and diverse marine life. The **Line Islands**, which are located in the eastern part of the country, are also home to a number of unique geological features, including underwater volcanoes and coral reefs.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Summer | December to February | 28-32°C | high | hot and humid, with frequent rain showers |\n| Autumn | March to May | 25-29°C | moderate | warm and sunny, with occasional rain showers |\n| Winter | June to August | 22-26°C | low | mild and dry, with clear skies |\n| Spring | September to November | 24-28°C | moderate | warm and sunny, with occasional rain showers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to November and March to May.
