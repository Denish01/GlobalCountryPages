The country's culinary traditions have been influenced by its history of British colonization, as well as its cultural exchange with neighboring islands. As a result, Kiribati's dishes often feature a mix of local and foreign flavors, with popular ingredients like fish, coconut milk, and **pandanus** leaves. Regional variations exist, with the northern islands tend to have more access to fresh seafood, while the southern islands rely more on root vegetables and imported goods.\n\nThe **I-Kiribati** people take great pride in their traditional cuisine, which is often served at special occasions and celebrations. The preparation of meals is a communal effort, with family members and friends gathering to share in the cooking and eating process. This sense of community and sharing is a key aspect of Kiribati's food culture, and visitors are often welcomed with open arms and invited to join in the feasting.\n\nKiribati's cuisine is also characterized by its use of **umwa**, a type of underground oven that is used to cook a variety of dishes, including **babai** (steamed taro and fish) and **bwabwai** (steamed breadfruit and coconut cream). The use of umwa is an important part of Kiribati's culinary traditions, and is often used to cook meals for special occasions.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Te buaka ni bora | Main Course | Boiled fish, coconut milk, and taro | Local restaurants in Tarawa |\n| Babai | Side Dish | Steamed taro and fish cooked in umwa | Traditional I-Kiribati gatherings |\n| Bwabwai | Dessert | Steamed breadfruit and coconut cream | Street vendors in Betio |\n| Kia | Main Course | Raw fish marinated in coconut milk and lime juice | Beachside restaurants in Abaiang |\n| Tekateka | Snack | Fried fish cakes made with fish, coconut, and taro | Markets in Tarawa |\n| Buakonikai | Main Course | Boiled fish and coconut milk soup | Local eateries in Kuria |\n| Utou | Side Dish | Boiled taro and coconut milk | Traditional I-Kiribati gatherings |\n| Te kate | Dessert | Coconut cream and sugar cake | Bakeries in Tarawa |\n| Abai | Main Course | Grilled fish and coconut milk sauce | Beachside restaurants in North Tarawa |\n| Eke | Snack | Fried doughnuts made with coconut milk and sugar | Street vendors in Betio |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Tekateka** (fried fish cakes): $2-$3 USD\n- **Buakonikai** (boiled fish and coconut milk soup): $3-$4 USD\n- **Utou** (boiled taro and coconut milk): $1-$2 USD\n- **Abai** (grilled fish and coconut milk sauce): $5-$6 USD\n- **Eke** (fried doughnuts): $1-$2 USD\n- **Kia** (raw fish marinated in coconut milk and lime juice): $4-$5 USD\n- **Bwabwai** (steamed breadfruit and coconut cream): $2-$3 USD\n- **Te kate** (coconut cream and sugar cake): $3-$4 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Kava**: a traditional Pacific Island drink made from the roots of the kava plant\n- **Coconut water**: a refreshing and hydrating drink made from young coconuts\n- **Te buakonikai** (coconut milk and sugar drink): a sweet and creamy drink made with coconut milk and sugar\n- **I-Kiribati coffee**: a strong and rich coffee made from locally-grown coffee beans\n- **Fresh fruit juice**: a variety of juices made from local fruits like oranges, pineapples, and coconuts\n- **Beer**: a selection of local and imported beers available at most restaurants and bars\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with your hands**: it is customary to eat with your hands in Kiribati, especially when eating traditional dishes like te buaka ni bora\n- **Sharing food**: sharing food is a key aspect of Kiribati's food culture, and visitors are often encouraged to share meals with their hosts\n- **Respecting elders**: it is customary to show respect to elders by offering them the best food and drinks\n- **Using utensils**: utensils like forks and knives are not commonly used in Kiribati, but are available at most restaurants\n- **Tipping**: tipping is not expected, but 5-10% is appreciated for good service\n- **Dress code**: a modest dress code is recommended when dining at traditional I-Kiribati gatherings\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local restaurants**: a variety of restaurants serving traditional I-Kiribati dishes and international cuisine\n- **Street vendors**: street vendors selling a range of snacks and dishes, from tekateka to bwabwai\n- **Markets**: markets selling fresh produce, seafood, and traditional dishes like babai and utou\n- **Beachside restaurants**: restaurants located on the beach, serving a range of seafood dishes and international cuisine\n- **Traditional I-Kiribati gatherings**: traditional gatherings where visitors can experience traditional I-Kiribati cuisine and culture\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Tarawa Market**: a bustling market selling fresh produce, seafood, and traditional dishes like babai and utou, located in the heart of Tarawa\n- **Betio Market**: a market selling a range of snacks and dishes, from tekateka to bwabwai, located in the town of Betio\n- **Abaiang Fishing Village**: a fishing village where visitors can experience traditional I-Kiribati fishing practices and enjoy fresh seafood, located on the island of Abaiang\n- **Kuria Village**: a village where visitors can experience traditional I-Kiribati cuisine and culture, located on the island of Kuria\n- **Te buaka ni bora cooking class**: a cooking class where visitors can learn how to make traditional I-Kiribati dishes like te buaka ni bora, located in Tarawa",
