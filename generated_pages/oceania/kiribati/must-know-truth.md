# The Truth About Kiribati - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Kiribati, officially known as the Republic of Kiribati, is a sovereign island nation located in the central Pacific Ocean. The country's history dates back to the 13th century when the first Micronesian settlers arrived on the islands. The islands were later discovered by European explorers, including Thomas Gilbert and John Marshall, in the late 18th century. In 1892, the Gilbert Islands, as they were then known, became a British protectorate, and in 1915, they were officially annexed by the United Kingdom as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.

The country gained internal self-government in 1977 and full independence from the United Kingdom on July 12, 1979. The name "Kiribati" is derived from the Gilbertese language and is pronounced "Ki-ri-bah-tee." The country's early years of independence were marked by a focus on developing its economy, infrastructure, and social services. Kiribati is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations, and it has maintained close ties with its former colonial power, the United Kingdom.

The country's history is also marked by its strategic location during World War II, when the islands were occupied by Japanese forces. The Battle of Tarawa, which took place in November 1943, was a significant turning point in the war in the Pacific. Today, Kiribati continues to work towards developing its economy and addressing the challenges posed by climate change, which threatens the very existence of the island nation.

Kiribati's early history is also characterized by the influence of European colonial powers, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. The country's unique cultural heritage reflects this history, with a blend of traditional Micronesian and European influences. The country's capital, Tarawa, is located on the largest island in the Gilbert Islands chain and is home to a significant proportion of the country's population.
