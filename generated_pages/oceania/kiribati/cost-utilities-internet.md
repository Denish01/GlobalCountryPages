[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Kiribati is relatively underdeveloped, and the quality of services can vary depending on the location. The cost of utilities in Kiribati can be unstable and may fluctuate due to factors such as fuel price changes and weather conditions. For example, during the dry season, water prices may increase due to scarcity, while during the wet season, electricity prices may rise due to increased demand for powering water pumps.

The government of Kiribati has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the installation of new solar-powered electricity systems and the expansion of water supply networks. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant challenge for many households, particularly those in rural areas. To mitigate these costs, some households rely on traditional methods such as rainwater harvesting and fuel-efficient cooking stoves.
