[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Kiribati is relatively small, with a total of approximately 120,740 people, according to the latest estimates. The country has been experiencing a moderate population growth rate of around 1.8% per annum, which is largely driven by a high total fertility rate of 3.5 children per woman. Kiribati's population is predominantly young, with a median age of 22.5 years, and over 55% of the population resides in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Tarawa. The population density is approximately 149 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high considering the limited land area of the country. 

The population growth and urbanization trends in Kiribati are closely linked to the country's economic development and migration patterns. Many I-Kiribati people migrate to other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, in search of better employment opportunities, which can have a significant impact on the country's population dynamics.

The government of Kiribati has been implementing various policies and programs aimed at addressing the challenges posed by population growth, urbanization, and climate change. These initiatives include investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, as well as efforts to promote sustainable development and reduce the country's vulnerability to climate-related risks.
