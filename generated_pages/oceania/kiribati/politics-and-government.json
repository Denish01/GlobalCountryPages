The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is directly elected by the people for a four-year term. The president is responsible for appointing the cabinet, which is composed of ministers who oversee various government departments. The **legislative branch**, known as the House of Assembly, is a unicameral body with 45 members, who are also directly elected by the people for a four-year term. The House of Assembly is responsible for making laws, approving the budget, and exercising parliamentary control over the executive branch. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, and the magistrate courts, which are responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are applied fairly.\n\nThe political system in Kiribati is characterized by a unitary structure, with a strong emphasis on local governance. The country is divided into 21 island councils, which are responsible for providing basic services such as education, health, and infrastructure. The island councils are also responsible for collecting taxes and making decisions on local development projects. The central government provides support to the island councils through funding and technical assistance.\n\nThe separation of powers in Kiribati is designed to ensure that no one branch of government has too much power. The executive branch is responsible for implementing the laws, while the legislative branch is responsible for making the laws.

This separation of powers helps to prevent abuse of power and ensures that the government is accountable to the people.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President Taneti Mamau | Head of state and government, appoints cabinet |\n| Legislative | House of Assembly | Speaker of the House | Makes laws, approves budget, exercises parliamentary control |\n| Judicial | Court of Appeal | Chief Justice | Interprets laws, ensures fair application of laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tobwaan Kiribati Party | center-right | Taneti Mamau | 22 | ruling party |\n| Boutokaan Te Koaua Party | center-left | Anote Tong | 17 | main opposition party |\n| Maurin Kiribati Party | right-wing | Jimmy Nuorea | 3 | minor party |\n| Kiribati First Party | left-wing | Taberannang Timeon | 2 | minor party |\n| Pillars of Truth | independent | Martin Tofinga | 1 | independent party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Kiribati is based on a simple plurality system, where the candidate with the most votes wins.\n- Elections are held every four years, with the most recent presidential election held in 2020.\n- The last parliamentary election was held in 2020, and the next election is scheduled for 2024.\n- Voter participation is generally high, with over 80% of eligible voters casting their ballots in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Kiribati is relatively stable, with a functioning democratic system and a low risk of political violence.\n- However, the country faces significant challenges related to **climate change**, including rising sea levels and increased frequency of natural disasters.\n- The government is also working to address issues related to **poverty and inequality**, with a focus on improving access to education and healthcare.\n- Regional dynamics, including the influence of **China and Taiwan**, are also an important factor in Kiribati's political landscape.\n- The country has a **medium level of freedom**, with a score of 64 out of 100 in the 2022 Freedom House report.\n- Corruption is a significant challenge, with Kiribati ranking 122 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Kiribati is a member of the **United Nations** and the **Commonwealth of Nations**, and has diplomatic relations with over 50 countries.\n- The country has a close relationship with **Australia and New Zealand**, which provide significant development assistance.\n- Kiribati is also a member of the **Pacific Islands Forum**, which aims to promote regional cooperation and economic development.\n- The country has a **pro-Western foreign policy**, and has been critical of Chinese influence in the region.\n- Kiribati has also been a strong advocate for **climate change action**, and has played a key role in regional and international efforts to address this issue.",
