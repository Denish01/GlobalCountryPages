[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Kiribati is structured around a network of public hospitals and health centers, with some private clinics and mission-run facilities also providing services. The public system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to limited access to quality care, particularly in rural areas. Urban areas, such as Tarawa, have better access to healthcare services, but even there, the quality of care can be inconsistent. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, but it faces significant challenges in terms of resources and infrastructure.

The public healthcare system in Kiribati provides free or low-cost services to citizens, but the quality of care can be variable. Private clinics and hospitals offer better quality care, but at a higher cost, making them inaccessible to many locals. **Foreign aid** and international organizations, such as the **World Health Organization**, play a significant role in supporting the healthcare system in Kiribati, particularly in areas such as disease prevention and control.

Despite these challenges, the healthcare system in Kiribati has made progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as **maternal and child health**. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant health challenges facing the country, including high rates of **non-communicable diseases** and limited access to specialized care.
