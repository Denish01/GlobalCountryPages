[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Kiribati, an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, has a tropical marine climate, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The country experiences a dry season, also known as the **trade wind season**, from May to October, and a wet season, also known as the **monsoon season**, from November to April. During the dry season, the weather is generally calm and sunny, with average temperatures ranging from 25 to 30 degrees Celsius. The wet season, on the other hand, is marked by increased rainfall, higher temperatures, and a higher risk of cyclones. The seasons significantly affect travel in Kiribati, as the wet season can make it difficult to travel between islands due to rough seas and canceled flights.

The dry season is the best time to engage in outdoor activities like **fishing**, **diving**, and **exploring** the islands. The calm seas and sunny weather make it ideal for boat trips and water sports. In contrast, the wet season is better suited for indoor activities like **cultural tours** and **visiting museums**. The increased rainfall and higher temperatures can also make it challenging to explore the islands, and some tourist facilities may be closed due to the weather conditions.

The seasonal variations also impact the **local economy** and **tourism industry**. During the peak season, from June to August, the prices for accommodations and tourist services are higher due to the increased demand. In contrast, the budget season, from November to April, offers lower prices and fewer crowds, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers.
