  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Wallis and Futuna can vary, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $250 USD, while internet plans with 60 Mbps speed can cost around $50 to $100 USD per month.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($75 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: XPF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Wallis and Futuna is relatively underdeveloped, with most of the population relying on **electricity** generated from diesel-powered plants. The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to the territory's reliance on imported fuel, which can lead to price increases during periods of high global demand. Additionally, the territory's remote location and limited infrastructure can result in higher costs for **water** and **garbage collection**. Seasonal variation in utility costs is also a factor, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning.\n\nThe French government, as the parent country, provides some subsidies to help stabilize the cost of utilities in Wallis and Futuna. However, the cost of utilities can still be relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The territory's utility company, **SEWF**, is responsible for providing electricity, water, and garbage collection services to the population. The company aims to provide reliable and efficient services, but the lack of infrastructure and limited resources can sometimes lead to outages and disruptions.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | not commonly used |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$165** | **$210** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10 Mbps | **SEWF**, **OPT** |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 60 Mbps | **SEWF**, **OPT** |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | **Pacific Mobile**, **Vodafone** |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 5-10 GB | **Pacific Mobile**, **Vodafone** |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $60-100 | varies | **SEWF**, **OPT** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited content available) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Wallis and Futuna, it is recommended to contact **SEWF** or **OPT** directly to arrange for connection and payment.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience.\n- **SEWF** and **OPT** are the main internet providers in the territory, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances and turn off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- Consider using a **solar panel** system to generate electricity and reduce reliance on the grid.",
