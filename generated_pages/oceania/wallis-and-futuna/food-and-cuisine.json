The territory's traditional dishes often feature fresh seafood, coconut milk, and root vegetables like taro and breadfruit. The **Wallisian** and **Futunian** people take great pride in their culinary heritage, and mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends. The French influence is evident in the use of baguettes and other baked goods, which are often served with meals.\n\nThe cuisine in Wallis and Futuna is also defined by its regional variations, with the island of Wallis having a more significant French influence, while Futuna has a stronger Polynesian flavor. The territory's remote location has helped preserve its unique culinary traditions, with many dishes still prepared using traditional methods and ingredients. Visitors to Wallis and Futuna can experience the local cuisine by attending a traditional **Kava** ceremony, where food and drink are shared as a sign of hospitality and respect.\n\nThe local cuisine is also closely tied to the territory's history and culture, with many dishes having been passed down through generations. The **Wallisian** people, for example, have a strong tradition of cooking with coconut milk and fish, which are abundant in the territory's waters. The **Futunian** people, on the other hand, have a preference for dishes made with taro and breadfruit, which are staple crops on the island.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Poisson Cru | Raw Fish | Marinated in coconut milk and lime juice | Local restaurants in Mata-Utu |\n| Ahima'a | Steamed Fish | Wrapped in banana leaves and steamed with coconut milk | Traditional Wallisian restaurants |\n| Fakahe | Steamed Taro | Steamed taro topped with coconut cream and fish | Local markets and food stalls |\n| Poulet au Coco | Chicken Dish | Chicken cooked in coconut milk and spices | French-influenced restaurants in Mata-Utu |\n| Taro Fritters | Snack | Deep-fried taro fritters served with a side of coconut cream | Street food vendors in Mata-Utu |\n| Kava | Traditional Drink | A traditional drink made from the roots of the kava plant | Local **Kava** ceremonies and traditional restaurants |\n| Faikakai | Dessert | A traditional Wallisian dessert made with coconut cream and sugar | Local bakeries and cafes |\n| Ika Vaka | Raw Fish | Raw fish marinated in coconut milk and lime juice, served with taro and breadfruit | Local restaurants in Futuna |\n| Hima'a | Grilled Fish | Grilled fish served with a side of coconut cream and steamed vegetables | Beachside restaurants and food stalls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Taro Fritters**: Deep-fried taro fritters served with a side of coconut cream, $3-$5 USD\n- **Coconut Cream Pastries**: Flaky pastries filled with coconut cream, $2-$3 USD\n- **Fresh Fruit**: Fresh fruit such as mangoes, pineapples, and bananas, $1-$2 USD\n- **Grilled Fish**: Grilled fish served with a side of coconut cream and steamed vegetables, $5-$7 USD\n- **Faikakai**: A traditional Wallisian dessert made with coconut cream and sugar, $2-$3 USD\n- **Kava**: A traditional drink made from the roots of the kava plant, $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Kava**: A traditional drink made from the roots of the kava plant, often served at **Kava** ceremonies\n- **Coconut Water**: Fresh coconut water, $1-$2 USD\n- **Fresh Fruit Juice**: Fresh fruit juice made with local fruits such as mangoes and pineapples, $2-$3 USD\n- **Beer**: Local beer such as **Hinano**, $3-$5 USD\n- **Wine**: French wine, $10-$20 USD\n- **Fresh Lime Juice**: Freshly squeezed lime juice, $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with Hands**: It's customary to eat with your hands, especially when eating traditional dishes like **Poisson Cru**\n- **Respect for Elders**: Show respect to elders by offering them the best seats and the first servings of food\n- **Sharing Food**: Sharing food is a sign of hospitality and respect, especially during **Kava** ceremonies\n- **Tipping**: Tipping is not mandatory, but 5-10% of the total bill is appreciated\n- **Dress Code**: Dress modestly when dining at traditional restaurants or attending **Kava** ceremonies\n- **Reservation**: Reservations are not usually necessary, but it's a good idea to call ahead to confirm availability\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local Restaurants**: Try traditional dishes like **Poisson Cru** and **Ahima'a** at local restaurants in Mata-Utu\n- **Food Stalls**: Street food vendors and food stalls offer a variety of snacks and dishes, including **Taro Fritters** and **Grilled Fish**\n- **Markets**: Local markets and food markets offer a wide range of fresh produce, meats, and traditional dishes\n- **Beachside Restaurants**: Enjoy fresh seafood and stunning views at beachside restaurants and food stalls\n- **French-Influenced Restaurants**: Try French-influenced cuisine at restaurants in Mata-Utu, including dishes like **Poulet au Coco**\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Mata-Utu Market**: A bustling market in the capital city, offering a wide range of fresh produce, meats, and traditional dishes\n- **Futuna Market**: A smaller market on the island of Futuna, offering a variety of local produce and traditional dishes\n- **Kava Ceremony**: Attend a traditional **Kava** ceremony to experience the local culture and cuisine\n- **Wallisian Cooking Class**: Take a cooking class to learn how to prepare traditional Wallisian dishes like **Poisson Cru** and **Ahima'a**\n- **Futunian Food Festival**: Attend the annual Futunian Food Festival to try a variety of local dishes and drinks",
