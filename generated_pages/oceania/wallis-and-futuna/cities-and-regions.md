The kingdoms of Uvea, Sigave, and Alo are further divided into districts, with a total of 36 villages. The administrative structure of Wallis and Futuna is based on a combination of traditional and modern systems, with the French government responsible for defense, foreign affairs, and some domestic policies, while the local government has autonomy over local matters such as education, health, and infrastructure.
