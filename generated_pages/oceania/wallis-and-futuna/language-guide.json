  "content": "The primary languages spoken in Wallis and Futuna are **French** and **Wallisian**, with French being the official language used in government, education, and formal situations, while Wallisian is the predominant language used in everyday life.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): French, Wallisian\nWidely Spoken: \nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Austronesian, Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Wallis and Futuna is characterized by the coexistence of French and Wallisian, with French being the language of administration, education, and formal communication, while Wallisian is the language of everyday life, traditional ceremonies, and cultural events. Wallisian is an Austronesian language closely related to other Polynesian languages, such as Tongan and Samoan. There are also regional dialects, with the Wallisian dialect being spoken on the island of Wallis and the Futunian dialect being spoken on the island of Futuna. English is not widely spoken, and proficiency in English is generally low, particularly among the older population.\n\nThe use of French is more prevalent in urban areas, such as the capital Mata-Utu, where government offices, schools, and businesses are located. In contrast, Wallisian is more widely spoken in rural areas, where traditional customs and cultural practices are still observed. Despite the limited English proficiency, many locals, particularly younger people and those in the tourism industry, may have some basic knowledge of English.\n\nThe language situation in Wallis and Futuna is also influenced by the territory's history as a French overseas collectivity. As a result, French is the primary language used in official contexts, and it is also the language of instruction in schools. However, in recent years, there has been an effort to promote the use of Wallisian and Futunian languages in education and cultural activities, recognizing the importance of preserving the territory's linguistic and cultural heritage.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Talofa | Tah-LOH-fah | formal |\n| Hello | Malo | MAH-loh | informal |\n| Thank you | Fakafetai | FAH-kah-FEH-tie |  |\n| Please | Fakamolemole | FAH-kah-MOH-leh-MOH-leh |  |\n| Yes / No | Io / Ikai | EE-oh / EE-kah-ee |  |\n| Excuse me | Fakatau | FAH-kah-TOW |  |\n| How much? | Fai | FAY |  |\n| Where is...? | Ko fea...? | KOH FEH-ah |  |\n| I don't understand | Ou te ke iloa | OH-oo TEH KEH ee-LOH-ah |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Ko e tautala 'Ingilisi? | KOH eh TOW-tah-lah EE-ng-ee-LEE-see |  |\n| Help! | Fakamolemole! | FAH-kah-MOH-leh-MOH-leh |  |\n| Goodbye | Tofa | TOH-fah | formal |\n| Sorry | Fakasori | FAH-kah-SOH-ree |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Tasi | TAH-see |\n| 2 | Lua | LOO-ah |\n| 3 | Tolu | TOH-loo |\n| 4 | Faa | FAH-ah |\n| 5 | Lima | LEE-mah |\n| 6 | Ono | OH-noh |\n| 7 | Fitu | FEE-too |\n| 8 | Valu | VAH-loo |\n| 9 | Iva | EE-vah |\n| 10 | Hogofulu | HOH-goh-FOO-loo |\n| 100 | Teau | TEH-ow |\n| 1000 | Afe | AH-feh |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when interacting with older people or in formal situations.\n- Use formal language and titles, such as \"Mister\" or \"Madam,\" when addressing people you don't know well.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered impolite, such as pointing with your feet or touching someone's head.\n- Learn some basic Wallisian phrases, such as greetings and expressions of gratitude, to show respect for the local culture.\n- Be patient and try to understand the local accent and pronunciation, which may be different from what you are used to.\n- Use non-verbal communication, such as smiling and making eye contact, to show friendliness and interest.\n- Don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification if you don't understand something.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help you communicate with locals.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help you learn basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Look for language learning resources, such as online courses or language exchange programs, to improve your French and Wallisian language skills.\n- Ask your hotel or tour operator for assistance with translation or interpretation services.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or interpreter to help you navigate the territory and communicate with locals.",
