The market is primarily driven by local demand, with a limited number of foreign buyers, mostly from France and other Pacific island nations. The current market conditions are relatively stable, with a slight increase in prices in recent years due to the growing demand for housing. The urban areas, such as Mata-Utu, tend to have higher prices compared to rural areas, where traditional homes and land are more affordable.\n\nThe price trajectory in Wallis and Futuna is expected to remain stable, with a possible slight increase in the coming years, driven by the growing population and limited supply of properties. The government has implemented initiatives to promote the development of the tourism sector, which may lead to an increase in demand for properties, particularly in areas with high tourism potential. However, the market is still relatively small, and the prices are expected to remain relatively low compared to other Pacific island nations.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is significant in Wallis and Futuna, with Mata-Utu being the main urban center and the hub of economic activity. The rural areas, such as Leava and Sigave, have a more traditional way of life, with a stronger focus on agriculture and fishing. The prices of properties in these areas are generally lower, but the availability of modern amenities and services is limited.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mata-Utu | $1,800 | $200 | Apartment |\n| Leava | $1,200 | $150 | House |\n| Sigave | $1,000 | $100 | Traditional Home |\n| Mala'e | $900 | $80 | Land |\n| Halalo | $1,500 | $180 | House |\n| Vaisei | $1,200 | $120 | Apartment |\n| Nuku | $800 | $60 | Traditional Home |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Wallis and Futuna, but they must obtain a **permit** from the local authorities, which can be a lengthy and bureaucratic process.\n- Foreign buyers are restricted from buying **coastal properties**, which are reserved for local residents.\n- Foreigners can establish a **local company** to purchase property, but this requires a significant investment and compliance with local regulations.\n- Foreign buyers must also comply with the **foreign investment regulations**, which require approval from the French government.\n- Foreigners can lease property for a maximum of **99 years**, which can provide a workaround for those who want to invest in the property market without going through the complexities of buying.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
