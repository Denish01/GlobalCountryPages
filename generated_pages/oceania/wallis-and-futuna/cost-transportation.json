The most common modes of transport are buses, taxis, and private vehicles, with many locals relying on their own cars or scooters to get around. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with regular bus services connecting the main towns and villages. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on their own vehicles or walk or cycle for shorter journeys.\n\nThe territory's small size and limited population mean that traffic congestion is not a major issue, and the roads are generally in good condition. However, the lack of street lighting and pedestrian infrastructure can make walking or cycling at night more challenging. Despite these limitations, the scenic beauty of the islands and the friendly local population make getting around Wallis and Futuna a pleasant and rewarding experience.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-$2 | $20-$30 | Good coverage of main towns and villages |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly used for shorter journeys |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5-$10 | $2-$5 | $10-$20 | Limited availability, mostly in Mata-Utu |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited options, mostly private car services |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To Mata-Utu, depending on the time of day and traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50-$2.50 | Limited fuel stations, mostly in Mata-Utu |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20-$2.00 | Limited fuel stations, mostly in Mata-Utu |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options, mostly in Mata-Utu |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mostly connecting main towns and villages |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited flights, mostly to and from Futuna |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider using the public bus service or walking or cycling for shorter journeys.\n- Download the **Pacific Island Transport** app to plan your journey and book tickets in advance.\n- Always negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before starting your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- Be aware of the limited fuel stations and plan your journey accordingly to avoid running out of fuel.\n- Consider renting a car or scooter to explore the islands, but be aware of the limited parking options and road conditions.\n- Always wear a helmet when cycling, and be mindful of the lack of street lighting and pedestrian infrastructure at night.",
