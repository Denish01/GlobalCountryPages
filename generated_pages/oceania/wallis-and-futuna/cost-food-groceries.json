The cost of living in Wallis and Futuna is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which increases the price of goods and services. Despite this, the local culture emphasizes home cooking, and many residents prefer to prepare traditional dishes using fresh ingredients from their gardens or the local market. Eating out is not as common, but there are still some excellent restaurants serving a mix of French, Polynesian, and local cuisine.\n\nThe prices of food in Wallis and Futuna can fluctuate depending on the season and availability of ingredients. Fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, are often more expensive than canned or imported alternatives. However, the local market offers a wide range of fresh seafood, which is a staple in the Wallisian diet. The cost of meat, particularly beef and chicken, is also relatively high due to the lack of local production. On the other hand, staple foods like rice, bread, and pasta are relatively affordable.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $3-$5 | 350-500 XPF | Imported from France |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2-$3 | 200-300 XPF | Local bakery |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $4-$6 | 450-650 XPF | Local farm |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 200-300 XPF | Imported from Asia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $10-$15 | 1,200-1,800 XPF | Imported from France |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $15-$20 | 1,800-2,500 XPF | Imported from Australia |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $8-$10 | 900-1,200 XPF | Imported from France |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 550-750 XPF | Local farm |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $3-$5 | 350-500 XPF | Local farm |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 200-300 XPF | Local farm |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $15-$20 | 1,800-2,500 XPF | Local dairy |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-$3 | 200-300 XPF | Local brand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | Traditional dishes like **Poisson cru** and **Ahima'a** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$30 | One person, **French-inspired cuisine** |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | 3 courses, **local seafood** |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$100 | Upscale, **French-Polynesian fusion** |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | **Bière de Wallis** |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$10 | **Heineken**, **Carlsberg** |\n| Cappuccino | $4-$6 | Local café |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | **Coca-Cola**, **Fanta** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of goods at supermarkets and local markets in Wallis and Futuna can vary significantly.
