[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Wallis and Futuna, a French territory in the Pacific Ocean, has a tropical marine climate with two distinct seasons: a dry season and a wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by warm temperatures, low humidity, and minimal rainfall. This period is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, snorkeling, and diving. In contrast, the wet season, which spans from November to April, is marked by high humidity, heavy rainfall, and an increased risk of cyclones. During this time, some tourist facilities may be closed, and travel can be more challenging.

The dry and wet seasons have a significant impact on travel in Wallis and Futuna. During the dry season, the weather is generally pleasant, making it an ideal time for exploring the islands' natural beauty, including its coral reefs, beaches, and forests. In contrast, the wet season can make travel more difficult, with some roads and trails becoming impassable due to heavy rainfall. Additionally, the risk of cyclones during the wet season can be a concern for travelers.

The climate in Wallis and Futuna is also influenced by its location in the Pacific Ocean, with the trade winds bringing a cooling breeze to the islands. The temperature remains relatively constant throughout the year, ranging from 22°C to 30°C (72°F to 86°F). However, the humidity can be high during the wet season, making the temperature feel warmer than it actually is.
