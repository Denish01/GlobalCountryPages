The public healthcare system is overseen by the French government, as Wallis and Futuna is an overseas collectivity of France. The quality of care is generally good, but the range of services and specialized care is limited. In urban areas like Mata-Utu, access to healthcare is relatively better, but in rural areas, medical facilities and services are scarce. The healthcare system faces challenges such as limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of medical professionals.\n\nThe public healthcare system provides essential medical services, including primary care, emergency services, and some specialized care. However, for more complex medical conditions, patients often need to be evacuated to New Caledonia or France for treatment. The private healthcare sector is relatively small, with a few private clinics and medical offices offering specialized services. Despite the challenges, the healthcare system in Wallis and Futuna has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in infrastructure, equipment, and training of medical staff.\n\nThe healthcare system in Wallis and Futuna also faces unique challenges due to its geographical location and cultural context. The territory is prone to natural disasters such as cyclones and tsunamis, which can disrupt medical services and infrastructure. Additionally, the local culture and traditional practices can influence healthcare-seeking behavior and adherence to medical treatment. Efforts are being made to address these challenges and improve healthcare outcomes, including the development of disaster preparedness plans and cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital of Mata-Utu | Mata-Utu | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Private Clinic of Mata-Utu | Mata-Utu | Private | General medicine, dentistry | Limited |\n| Health Center of Sigave | Sigave | Public | Primary care, emergency services | No |\n| Health Center of Alo | Alo | Public | Primary care, emergency services | No |\n| Medical Office of Wallis | Mata-Utu | Private | Specialized care, cardiology | Limited |\n| Dispensary of Futuna | Futuna | Public | Primary care, pharmacy services | No |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expats, as it provides access to better medical facilities and services.\n- Local insurance options are limited, but some private insurance companies offer coverage for medical expenses in Wallis and Futuna.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** is available for foreigners living and working in the territory, providing coverage for medical expenses, including evacuation and repatriation.\n- The cost of health insurance varies depending on the provider, coverage, and individual circumstances.\n- Some insurance providers offer **comprehensive coverage**, including medical, dental, and vision care, while others offer more limited coverage.\n- It is essential to carefully review insurance policies and coverage before purchasing, to ensure that it meets individual needs and circumstances.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacies** are available in Mata-Utu and some other towns, but the range of medications and supplies is limited.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication and the provider, but generally, a prescription from a licensed medical professional is required.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, but some specialized medications may not be readily available.\n- The **cost of medications** can be high, especially for imported medications.\n- It is recommended to bring a supply of essential medications and personal medical supplies when traveling to Wallis and Futuna.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Wallis and Futuna.\n- **Typhoid** and **rabies** vaccinations may be recommended for certain travelers, depending on their activities and exposure to risk.\n- **Insect-borne diseases** such as dengue fever and Zika virus are present in the territory, and travelers should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water and avoid eating undercooked or raw foods.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating foods from street vendors or unlicensed establishments.\n- **Sun protection** is essential, as the sun can be intense in the Pacific Islands.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Medical tourism is not a significant industry in Wallis and Futuna, due to the limited availability of specialized medical services.\n- However, some **private clinics** in Mata-Utu may offer specialized services such as dental care or cosmetic surgery.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are not available in the territory, but some medical facilities may have international accreditation or certification.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for certain medical procedures, but it is essential to carefully research and compare prices before seeking medical care.\n- It is recommended to consult with a medical professional before seeking medical care in Wallis and Futuna, to ensure that the necessary services and facilities are available.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In case of a **medical emergency**, call the emergency number 15 or seek immediate attention at the nearest medical facility.\n- **Ambulance services** are limited, and response times may be slow, especially in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may not have the necessary facilities or equipment to treat complex medical conditions, and evacuation to New Caledonia or France may be necessary.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed promptly, and it is essential to keep detailed records of medical expenses and treatment.\n- It is recommended to have a **contingency plan** in place, including emergency contact information and a plan for evacuation or repatriation if necessary.",
