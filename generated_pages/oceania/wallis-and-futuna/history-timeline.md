# Wallis and Futuna History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Wallis and Futuna is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans over a thousand years, from the earliest Polynesian settlers to the present day as a French overseas collectivity.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Wallis and Futuna began around the 10th century when Polynesian settlers arrived on the islands, likely from present-day Samoa and Tonga. These early inhabitants developed a rich and vibrant culture, with their own language, customs, and traditions. In the 18th century, European explorers, including British and French navigators, arrived on the islands, marking the beginning of the colonial period. The Kingdom of Wallis, which included the islands of Wallis, Futuna, and Alofi, was established in the 16th century and was ruled by a series of monarchs, with the Lavelua dynasty being the most prominent. The French colonial period, which began in the late 19th century, had a profound impact on the islands, with the introduction of Christianity, European education, and modern infrastructure.

The colonial period was marked by significant changes, including the establishment of a French protectorate over the Kingdom of Wallis in 1887, and the eventual annexation of the islands by France in 1917. During World War II, Wallis and Futuna played an important role as a strategic location for the Allies, with the islands serving as a base for military operations in the Pacific. In the post-war period, the islands began to move towards greater autonomy, with the establishment of a territorial assembly in 1961. Today, Wallis and Futuna is a French overseas collectivity, with a high degree of autonomy in internal affairs, but with France responsible for defense and foreign affairs.

The history of Wallis and Futuna is also marked by the complex relationships between the islands and their neighbors, including Samoa and Fiji. The islands have a rich cultural heritage, with a unique blend of Polynesian and French influences, and a strong sense of identity and tradition. The modern era has seen significant economic development, with a growing tourism industry and investments in infrastructure, including a new airport and harbor facilities. Despite these advances, the islands still face significant challenges, including a small and isolated population, limited economic resources, and vulnerability to natural disasters.

The cultural heritage of Wallis and Futuna is an important part of the islands' identity, with a rich tradition of music, dance, and art. The islands are home to a number of important cultural festivals, including the **Fête du Territoire**, which celebrates the islands' history and culture. The islands are also home to a number of important historical sites, including the **Fort de l'Ilôt**, a 19th-century fort that played a significant role in the islands' colonial history.
