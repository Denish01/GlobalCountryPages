[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in Wallis and Futuna is Hihifo Airport, also known as Wallis Island Airport, which receives flights from New Caledonia and French Polynesia. There are no direct flights from major hubs, so travelers typically need to connect through these nearby French territories. Overland entry points do not exist, as Wallis and Futuna is an island territory in the Pacific Ocean. 

Travelers can reach Wallis and Futuna by flying into Hihifo Airport, which is located on the island of Wallis. From there, they can take a domestic flight or a ferry to the island of Futuna. The airport is small, with limited facilities, but it provides a convenient entry point for visitors. The nearest major airports are in Noumea, New Caledonia, and Papeete, French Polynesia, which offer connections to Australia, New Zealand, and other Pacific islands.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in Wallis and Futuna are limited, with only a few routes available between the islands of Wallis and Futuna. The main domestic airline is Aircalin, which operates flights between Hihifo Airport and Futuna Airport. Booking in advance is recommended, as flights can be irregular and subject to change. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 USD per person, depending on the route and time of year. 

It's essential to book domestic flights well in advance, especially during peak travel seasons. Travelers can book flights through the Aircalin website or through local travel agencies. It's also a good idea to confirm flight schedules and prices before traveling, as they can change frequently.
