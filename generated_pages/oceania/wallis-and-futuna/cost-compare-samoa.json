In contrast, Samoa, an independent island nation, has a more affordable cost of living, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. The economic context of both countries is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern industries, with a strong focus on agriculture, fishing, and tourism. Overall, Samoa is the more affordable option, with prices around 15-20% lower than in Wallis and Futuna.\n\nThe main factors contributing to the cost of living difference between the two countries are the cost of housing, food, and transportation. In Wallis and Futuna, the lack of competition and limited availability of goods and services drive up prices, while in Samoa, the economy is more competitive, and the government has implemented policies to control prices and promote local production. As a result, expats, students, and retirees may find Samoa a more attractive option, while those with higher incomes or specific requirements may prefer Wallis and Futuna.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Samoa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 550 | 31% cheaper in Samoa |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 350 | 30% cheaper in Samoa |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 900 | 25% cheaper in Samoa |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Samoa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 150 | 100 | 33% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 40% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 33% cheaper in Samoa |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Samoa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 20 | 33% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.5 | 1.2 | 20% cheaper in Samoa |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Samoa (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper in Samoa |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Samoa (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% cheaper in Samoa |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,800 | 30% cheaper in Samoa |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Wallis and Futuna is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end dining and entertainment options\n  - Luxury goods and imported products\n  - Access to modern amenities and infrastructure\n  - French-language education and cultural events\n- **Samoa is cheaper for:**\n  - Housing and accommodation options\n  - Local food and dining experiences\n  - Transportation and fuel costs\n  - Outdoor activities and nature-based tourism\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Samoa offers a more affordable cost of living, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.
