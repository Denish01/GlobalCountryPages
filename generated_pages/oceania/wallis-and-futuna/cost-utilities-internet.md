[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Wallis and Futuna is relatively underdeveloped, with most of the population relying on **electricity** generated from diesel-powered plants. The cost of utilities can fluctuate due to the territory's reliance on imported fuel, which can lead to price increases during periods of high global demand. Additionally, the territory's remote location and limited infrastructure can result in higher costs for **water** and **garbage collection**. Seasonal variation in utility costs is also a factor, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning.

The French government, as the parent country, provides some subsidies to help stabilize the cost of utilities in Wallis and Futuna. However, the cost of utilities can still be relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The territory's utility company, **SEWF**, is responsible for providing electricity, water, and garbage collection services to the population. The company aims to provide reliable and efficient services, but the lack of infrastructure and limited resources can sometimes lead to outages and disruptions.
