Wallis and Futuna has a relatively high GDP per capita, driven by French investment and a strong public sector, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Fiji's economy is more diversified, with a growing tourism industry and a significant agricultural sector, which helps keep costs lower. Overall, Fiji is generally cheaper than Wallis and Futuna, with a difference of around 20-30% in the cost of living.\n\nThe cost of living difference between the two countries is largely due to the availability and affordability of goods and services. Wallis and Futuna, being a remote territory, relies heavily on imports, which drives up the cost of living. Fiji, on the other hand, has a more developed economy and a larger population, which enables it to produce and distribute goods more efficiently, resulting in lower costs. Additionally, Fiji's tourism industry has led to the development of a range of accommodation options, from budget-friendly guesthouses to luxury resorts, which cater to different budgets and preferences.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Fiji (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 60% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 600 | 350 | 71% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 1,000 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Fiji (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 20 | 15 | 33% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 150 | 100 | 50% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 67% more |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Fiji (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 30 | 67% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1.50 | 33% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.50 | 1.20 | 25% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Fiji (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 50% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 67% more |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 33% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Wallis and Futuna (USD) | Fiji (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 39% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,500 | 60% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Wallis and Futuna is cheaper for:**\n- High-quality healthcare services, with a well-equipped hospital and access to specialized medical care\n- A range of outdoor activities, including snorkeling, diving, and hiking, with stunning natural scenery\n- A unique cultural experience, with a blend of French and Polynesian influences\n- A relatively low crime rate, making it a safe destination for visitors\n- **Fiji is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation options, with a wide range of budget-friendly guesthouses and resorts\n- Food and dining, with a variety of affordable restaurants and local markets\n- Transportation, with a well-developed public transport system and affordable taxi fares\n- Tourist activities, with a range of affordable options, including snorkeling, diving, and island-hopping tours\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Fiji offers better value for money, with a lower cost of living and a wider range of accommodation options.
