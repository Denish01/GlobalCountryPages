[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The infrastructure in Wallis and Futuna is still in the development stage, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The territory's remote location and limited resources have hindered the development of its infrastructure, but recent investments from France have helped to improve the situation. The French government has provided funding for various infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads, the upgrade of the airport, and the development of renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, the territory still faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled labor and limited access to modern technologies.

The urban area of Mata-Utu has better infrastructure than the rural areas, with access to basic amenities such as electricity, water, and telecommunications. However, the rural areas still lack access to these basic services, and the roads are often in poor condition. The territory's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and tsunamis, which can cause significant damage to the roads, buildings, and other infrastructure.

In recent years, the government of Wallis and Futuna has made efforts to improve the infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the upgrade of the airport. The territory has also made progress in the development of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power. However, more needs to be done to address the significant gap between urban and rural areas and to improve the overall quality of the infrastructure.
