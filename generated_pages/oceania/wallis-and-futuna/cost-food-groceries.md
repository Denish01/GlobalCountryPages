[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Wallis and Futuna's food prices are generally higher compared to other Pacific Island nations due to its remote location and reliance on imported goods. The cost of living in Wallis and Futuna is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which increases the price of goods and services. Despite this, the local culture emphasizes home cooking, and many residents prefer to prepare traditional dishes using fresh ingredients from their gardens or the local market. Eating out is not as common, but there are still some excellent restaurants serving a mix of French, Polynesian, and local cuisine.

The prices of food in Wallis and Futuna can fluctuate depending on the season and availability of ingredients. Fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, are often more expensive than canned or imported alternatives. However, the local market offers a wide range of fresh seafood, which is a staple in the Wallisian diet. The cost of meat, particularly beef and chicken, is also relatively high due to the lack of local production. On the other hand, staple foods like rice, bread, and pasta are relatively affordable.
