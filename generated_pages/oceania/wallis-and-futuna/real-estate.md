[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The real estate market in Wallis and Futuna is characterized by a limited supply of properties, mostly traditional homes and a few modern apartments, with prices relatively stable due to the small size of the market. The market is primarily driven by local demand, with a limited number of foreign buyers, mostly from France and other Pacific island nations. The current market conditions are relatively stable, with a slight increase in prices in recent years due to the growing demand for housing. The urban areas, such as Mata-Utu, tend to have higher prices compared to rural areas, where traditional homes and land are more affordable.

The price trajectory in Wallis and Futuna is expected to remain stable, with a possible slight increase in the coming years, driven by the growing population and limited supply of properties. The government has implemented initiatives to promote the development of the tourism sector, which may lead to an increase in demand for properties, particularly in areas with high tourism potential. However, the market is still relatively small, and the prices are expected to remain relatively low compared to other Pacific island nations.

The urban-rural divide is significant in Wallis and Futuna, with Mata-Utu being the main urban center and the hub of economic activity. The rural areas, such as Leava and Sigave, have a more traditional way of life, with a stronger focus on agriculture and fishing. The prices of properties in these areas are generally lower, but the availability of modern amenities and services is limited.
