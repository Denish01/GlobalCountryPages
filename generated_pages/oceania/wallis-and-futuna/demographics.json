  "content": "The population of Wallis and Futuna is approximately 11,620 people, with a unique blend of Polynesian and French cultural influences.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 0.011 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.3%\nMedian Age: 29 years\nUrban Population: 60%\nPopulation Density: 82 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 78 years\nFertility Rate: 2.5 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe population of Wallis and Futuna is relatively small, with a total of approximately 11,620 people, according to the latest estimates. The population growth rate is slow, at around 0.3% per year, which is largely due to a low fertility rate and a significant proportion of the population migrating to other countries, such as France and New Caledonia, in search of better economic opportunities. The population is mostly urban, with around 60% of people living in the capital city of Mata-Utu and other urban areas. The population density is relatively high, at 82 people per square kilometer, which can put pressure on the territory's limited resources.\n\nThe population of Wallis and Futuna has been relatively stable over the past few decades, with some fluctuations due to migration and fertility rates. However, the territory's population is expected to continue growing slowly, driven by a relatively high total fertility rate and improvements in healthcare and living standards. The government of Wallis and Futuna, in association with France, has implemented various policies to support population growth and development, including investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\nThe urbanization trend in Wallis and Futuna is also significant, with many young people moving to the capital city of Mata-Utu in search of better job opportunities and access to services. However, this trend also poses challenges, such as overcrowding and strain on resources, which the government is working to address through investments in urban planning and infrastructure development.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Wallisian | 80% | Wallis Island | Polynesian ethnicity |\n| Futunian | 15% | Futuna Island | Polynesian ethnicity |\n| French | 3% | Mata-Utu | European ethnicity |\n| Other Pacific Islanders | 1% | Various | Melanesian and Micronesian ethnicities |\n| Other | 1% | Various | Asian and other ethnicities |\n[/TABLE]\nThe population of Wallis and Futuna is predominantly Polynesian, with the Wallisian and Futunian ethnic groups making up around 95% of the total population.

The French ethnic group, which includes people of European descent, makes up a small but significant proportion of the population, particularly in the capital city of Mata-Utu.
