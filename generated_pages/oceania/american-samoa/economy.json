The economy is still developing, with a strong reliance on the United States for financial support, including funding for government services and infrastructure development. The territory's remote location and limited natural resources have hindered economic growth, but efforts to diversify the economy and promote private sector development are underway. The economy has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by increases in tuna fishing and canning, as well as a growing tourism sector.\n\nThe territory's economic development is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, which provides significant financial support and guidance. American Samoa is not subject to federal income tax, and the local government has implemented various incentives to attract businesses and investments. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global tuna markets and fluctuations in tourism demand.\n\nThe government of American Samoa has implemented various initiatives to promote economic development, including efforts to improve the business environment, invest in infrastructure, and support the growth of key industries such as tourism and fisheries. These initiatives aim to reduce the territory's reliance on the United States and promote sustainable economic growth.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tuna fishing and canning | 50% of GDP | American Samoa is home to one of the largest tuna canneries in the world, with exports valued at over $200 million annually |\n| Tourism | 15% of GDP | The territory's natural beauty, including its coral reefs and rainforests, attracts over 20,000 visitors annually |\n| Government services | 20% of GDP | The local government is the largest employer in the territory, providing services including healthcare, education, and infrastructure development |\n| Manufacturing | 5% of GDP | Small-scale manufacturing activities, including food processing and handicrafts, contribute to the territory's economic diversity |\n| Agriculture | 2% of GDP | Subsistence farming and small-scale commercial farming activities, including copra and taro production, support local food security |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Canned tuna\n- Frozen fish\n- Petroleum products\n- Clothing and textiles\n- Handicrafts\nThese exports are primarily destined for the United States, with smaller volumes exported to other countries in the region.\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- Petroleum products\n- Food and beverages\n- Machinery and equipment\n- Vehicles\n- Electronics\nThese imports are primarily sourced from the United States, with smaller volumes imported from other countries in the region.\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- United States\n- Australia\n- New Zealand\n- Samoa\n- Fiji\nThese countries are the primary destinations for American Samoa's exports and sources of its imports.\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The territory has a well-developed road network, with over 200 kilometers of paved roads connecting the main villages and towns.\n- American Samoa has two main ports, including the Port of Pago Pago, which handles the majority of the territory's imports and exports.\n- The territory is served by a single international airport, the Pago Pago International Airport, which offers flights to Apia, Samoa, and Honolulu, Hawaii.\n- Internet and mobile phone penetration is relatively high, with over 90% of households having access to these services.\n- The territory has a reliable electricity supply, with power generated from a combination of diesel and renewable energy sources.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe economy of American Samoa is expected to continue growing, driven by increases in tuna fishing and canning, as well as a growing tourism sector.
