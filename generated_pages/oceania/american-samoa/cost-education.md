[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in American Samoa is based on the United States model, with 12 years of compulsory education. Public schools are free or subsidized, and the language of instruction is English, although Samoan is also taught as a subject. The quality of public education is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and English. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more exclusive and often higher-quality education, with smaller class sizes and more resources. International schools are also available, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).

The education system in American Samoa is overseen by the American Samoa Department of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, administering exams, and providing support to schools. The department also works to promote education and vocational training, with a focus on developing the skills and knowledge needed for the local workforce. For expats and international students, American Samoa offers a unique and culturally rich education experience, with opportunities to learn about Samoan culture and language. However, the availability of international schools and programs may be limited compared to larger territories or countries.
