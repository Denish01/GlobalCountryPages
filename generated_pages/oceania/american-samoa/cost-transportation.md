[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
American Samoa has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on personal vehicles or **taxis** to get around. The main transportation modes in the territory include buses, taxis, and ferries, with buses being the most affordable option. However, the quality of public transit is limited, and most people prefer to use their own vehicles or **carpool** with friends and family. The territory's road network is relatively small, with most roads being paved and well-maintained, but traffic can be a problem, especially during peak hours.

The lack of a well-developed public transportation system makes it difficult for visitors to get around without a car. However, many hotels and resorts offer **shuttle services** to and from the airport, as well as around the island. Additionally, there are several **car rental companies** available, offering a range of vehicles from economy cars to SUVs. It's worth noting that driving in American Samoa can be challenging, especially for those who are not used to driving on the right-hand side of the road.
