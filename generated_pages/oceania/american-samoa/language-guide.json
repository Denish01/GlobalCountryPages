  "content": "The primary languages spoken in American Samoa are Samoan and English, with Samoan being the predominant language and English widely understood, particularly in business and tourism settings.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Samoan, English\nWidely Spoken: Tokelauan, Tuvaluan\nEnglish Proficiency: High\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Austronesian\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nAmerican Samoa's linguistic landscape is characterized by the widespread use of Samoan, which is the native language of the islands. Samoan is a Polynesian language that is closely related to other languages spoken in the Pacific, such as Tongan and Fijian. English is also widely spoken, particularly in business, education, and tourism, due to the territory's historical ties with the United States. There are also smaller communities of people who speak other Pacific languages, such as Tokelauan and Tuvaluan. Regional dialects of Samoan are also present, with some variations in vocabulary and pronunciation between different villages and islands. Overall, American Samoa's language situation is characterized by a high degree of bilingualism, with many people speaking both Samoan and English fluently.\n\nThe use of English in American Samoa is widespread, particularly in formal settings such as government, education, and business. However, Samoan is still the predominant language in many everyday situations, such as in traditional ceremonies, family gatherings, and informal conversations. Visitors to American Samoa will often find that they can communicate effectively in English, particularly in tourist areas and with younger people. However, learning some basic Samoan phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people.\n\nIn addition to Samoan and English, there are also some minority languages spoken in American Samoa, including Tokelauan and Tuvaluan. These languages are spoken by smaller communities of people who have migrated to American Samoa from other Pacific islands. While these languages are not as widely spoken as Samoan and English, they are still an important part of the territory's linguistic diversity.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Talofa | Tah-LOH-fah | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Malo | MAH-lo | informal |\n| Thank you | Fa'afetai | fah-ah-FEH-tie |  |\n| Please | Fa'amolemole | fah-ah-moh-LEH-moh-leh |  |\n| Yes / No | Io / Leai | EE-oh / LEH-ah-ee |  |\n| Excuse me | Fa'afetai | fah-ah-FEH-tie |  |\n| How much? | E fia | AY FEE-ah |  |\n| Where is...? | O fea... | OH FAY-ah |  |\n| I don't understand | Ou te le iloa | OH-oo TEH LEH ee-LOH-ah |  |\n| Do you speak English? | E mafai e te talanoa i le fa'aperetania? | AY MAH-fie EH TEH tah-lah-NOH-ah ee LEH fah-ah-peh-reh-TAH-nee-ah |  |\n| Help! | Fesoasoani! | feh-soh-ah-SOH-nee |  |\n| Goodbye | Tofa | TOH-fah | formal |\n| Sorry | Fa'afetai | fah-ah-FEH-tie |  |\n| How are you? | Pe fea mai oe? | PEH FAY MAH-ee OH-eh |  |\n| I'm fine, thank you | Manuia, fa'afetai | mah-NOO-ee-ah, fah-ah-FEH-tie |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Tasi | TAH-see |\n| 2 | Lua | LOO-ah |\n| 3 | Tolu | TOH-loo |\n| 4 | Fa | FAH |\n| 5 | Lima | LEE-mah |\n| 6 | Ono | OH-noh |\n| 7 | Fitu | FEE-too |\n| 8 | Valu | VAH-loo |\n| 9 | Iva | EE-vah |\n| 10 | Sefulu | SEH-foo-loo |\n| 100 | Selau | SEH-lah-oo |\n| 1000 | Afe | AH-feh |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of the local culture and customs, particularly when interacting with older people or in traditional settings.\n- Use formal language and titles, such as \"Talofa\" and \"Mr./Mrs./Ms.\", when addressing people you don't know well.\n- Avoid using gestures or body language that may be considered rude or insulting, such as pointing with your feet or touching someone's head.\n- Learn some basic Samoan phrases, such as \"Talofa\" and \"Fa'afetai\", to show respect and appreciation for the local culture.\n- Be patient and don't rush conversations, as Samoans tend to value politeness and courtesy over efficiency.\n- Use non-verbal communication, such as smiling and making eye contact, to show friendliness and interest.\n- Avoid talking about sensitive topics, such as politics or religion, unless you are sure it is acceptable to do so.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a Samoan language app, such as iSamoan or Samoan Dictionary, to help you learn basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary, such as the \"Samoan Language Phrasebook\" or \"Samoan-English Dictionary\", to help you communicate in everyday situations.\n- Look for local language schools or tutors who can provide you with personalized language instruction and cultural insights.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites or YouTube channels, to learn more about the Samoan language and culture.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or interpreter who can help you navigate the territory and communicate with locals.",
