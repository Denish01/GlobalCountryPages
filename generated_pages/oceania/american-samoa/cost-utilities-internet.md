[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in American Samoa is relatively well-developed, with the American Samoa Power Authority (ASPA) providing electricity and water services to the territory. However, the cost of utilities can be subject to fluctuations due to factors such as fuel prices and seasonal variation in demand. During the summer months, electricity demand tends to increase due to the use of air conditioning, which can lead to higher bills. On the other hand, the cost of water is relatively stable, with a fixed rate per gallon.

The overall quality of the utility infrastructure in American Samoa is good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, there may be occasional outages or disruptions due to maintenance or natural disasters. The ASPA is responsible for maintaining and upgrading the utility infrastructure, and it has implemented various initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities in American Samoa remains relatively high compared to other territories or states in the United States.
