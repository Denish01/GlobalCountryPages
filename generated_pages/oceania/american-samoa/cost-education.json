Public schools are free or subsidized, and the language of instruction is English, although Samoan is also taught as a subject. The quality of public education is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and English. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more exclusive and often higher-quality education, with smaller class sizes and more resources. International schools are also available, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).\n\nThe education system in American Samoa is overseen by the American Samoa Department of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, administering exams, and providing support to schools. The department also works to promote education and vocational training, with a focus on developing the skills and knowledge needed for the local workforce. For expats and international students, American Samoa offers a unique and culturally rich education experience, with opportunities to learn about Samoan culture and language. However, the availability of international schools and programs may be limited compared to larger territories or countries.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, emphasis on core subjects |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Smaller class sizes, more resources, Christian or Catholic focus |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Good facilities, range of extracurricular activities |\n| Private Secondary | $4,000-$8,000 | Higher-quality facilities, more individual attention, college prep |\n| International School | $8,000-$12,000 | IB or CIE curriculum, international faculty, small class sizes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $2,000-$4,000 | $4,000-$6,000 | American Samoa Community College, associate's and bachelor's degrees |\n| Private University | $6,000-$10,000 | $8,000-$12,000 | Limited options, often online or distance learning |\n| Top-Ranked University | $8,000-$12,000 | $10,000-$15,000 | University of Hawaii, online or distance learning programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Limited options, often church-based or informal |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $30-$75 | Available for core subjects, often from teachers or recent graduates |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Samoan language courses, often through community colleges or language schools |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100-$300 | Basic materials, often provided by schools or subsidized |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for most schools, often simple and functional |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The American Samoa Department of Education is working to improve education quality, with a focus on teacher training and curriculum development.\n- Expats and international students may find that the education system in American Samoa is similar to that in the United States, with a strong emphasis on core subjects and extracurricular activities.\n- Scholarship opportunities are limited, but available through the American Samoa Government and private organizations.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular, with many universities and colleges offering distance learning programs.\n- The education quality in American Samoa is generally considered to be good, although it may not be as high as in some other developed countries or territories.\n- For those looking for a unique and culturally rich education experience, American Samoa may be an attractive option, with opportunities to learn about Samoan culture and language.",
