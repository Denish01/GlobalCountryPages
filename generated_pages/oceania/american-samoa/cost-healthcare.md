[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in American Samoa is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, with lower costs for doctor visits, hospital stays, and other medical services. However, the public system often has limited resources and long wait times, which can make it difficult for patients to receive timely and comprehensive care. In contrast, the private healthcare system in American Samoa offers more comprehensive and timely care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary option, while foreigners and those with private insurance may prefer to use private healthcare services.

The healthcare system in American Samoa is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, with many medical professionals and supplies being imported from the US. This can affect the cost and availability of certain medical services, particularly specialized care. Additionally, the territorial government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including programs to increase the number of medical professionals and upgrade medical facilities. Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in American Samoa still faces significant challenges, including limited resources, high costs, and a shortage of specialized medical professionals.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies, with costs ranging from 10-50 USD per prescription
- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, with prices similar to those in the US
- Some medications may be difficult to find or require a special order, which can increase costs and wait times
- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not always have the latest or most advanced medications
- Patients can often negotiate prices or discounts, particularly for cash payments
- Some pharmacies may offer delivery or mail-order services, which can be convenient for patients with mobility issues or living in remote areas

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, patients should call 911 or visit the emergency room at the LBJ Tropical Medical Center, which is the main hospital in American Samoa. The hospital has a 24-hour emergency department and offers a range of medical services, including surgery, intensive care, and radiology. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance that covers emergency medical evacuation, as some medical procedures may not be available in American Samoa. Additionally, patients should be aware that medical facilities and equipment may not always be up to US standards, and some medical professionals may not speak English fluently.

For non-emergency situations, patients can visit a private clinic or doctor's office, which can provide more personalized and timely care. However, these services can be more expensive than public healthcare options. It is also recommended to research and choose a reputable and qualified medical provider, as some private clinics may not have the same standards as those in the US. Overall, while American Samoa has a functional healthcare system, patients should be aware of the potential limitations and challenges, and take steps to ensure they have access to quality medical care when needed.
