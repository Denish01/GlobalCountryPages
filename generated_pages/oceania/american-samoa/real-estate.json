The market is driven by demand from locals, as well as from the US military and government personnel stationed on the island. Currently, the market is experiencing a moderate growth trend, with prices increasing steadily over the past few years. The urban areas, such as Pago Pago and Tafuna, tend to have higher property prices compared to the rural areas, where land is more abundant and affordable. However, the rural areas often lack modern amenities and infrastructure, making them less desirable for some buyers.\n\nThe price trajectory of the property market in American Samoa is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the growing demand for housing and the limited supply of available land. The government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the economy and attract foreign investment, which is likely to have a positive impact on the property market. However, the market is also subject to external factors, such as changes in the global economy and the potential impact of natural disasters, which can affect property prices and demand.\n\nThe urban-rural divide in American Samoa is significant, with the urban areas offering a range of modern amenities, including shopping centers, restaurants, and entertainment venues. In contrast, the rural areas are often more traditional and laid-back, with a stronger focus on community and family ties. Buyers must carefully consider their lifestyle and priorities when choosing between urban and rural areas, as the two offer distinct advantages and disadvantages.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pago Pago | 1,500 | 800 | Apartment |\n| Tafuna | 1,200 | 600 | House |\n| Nu'uuli | 1,000 | 500 | Traditional |\n| Alega | 800 | 400 | Rural |\n| Faleasao | 700 | 350 | Rural |\n| Leone | 900 | 450 | Suburban |\n| Aunuu | 1,100 | 550 | Island |\n| Ofu | 1,300 | 650 | Island |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in American Samoa, but they must obtain a **leasehold** agreement from the local government, which typically lasts for 55 years.\n- Foreign buyers must also register with the **American Samoa Department of Commerce** and obtain a **business license** if they plan to rent out their property.\n- There are restrictions on the types of properties that foreigners can buy, with a focus on **residential** and **commercial** properties.\n- Foreign buyers must also comply with the **American Samoa Foreign Investment Act**, which requires them to demonstrate the economic benefits of their investment.\n- Foreign buyers may also consider setting up a **local company** to purchase property, which can provide additional benefits and flexibility.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
