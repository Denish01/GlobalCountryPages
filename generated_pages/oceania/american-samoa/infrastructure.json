  "content": "The infrastructure in American Samoa is relatively underdeveloped, with ongoing efforts to improve roads, energy, water, and telecommunications systems, but still facing challenges in providing reliable and modern services to its population. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 31%\nRoad Network: 241 km, moderate quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nAmerican Samoa's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other territories in Oceania. The territory has made recent investments in upgrading its roads, energy generation, and water systems, but there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas. Pago Pago, the capital, has better access to modern infrastructure, while rural villages often lack reliable services. The American Samoa Government has been working to address these disparities and improve overall infrastructure development.\n\nThe territory's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tsunamis, which can cause significant damage to roads, power lines, and buildings. In recent years, American Samoa has experienced several major storms, highlighting the need for more resilient and sustainable infrastructure. To address these challenges, the government has been working with international partners, including the United States, to secure funding and technical assistance for infrastructure development projects.\n\nDespite these challenges, American Samoa has made progress in improving its infrastructure, particularly in the areas of energy and telecommunications. The territory has invested in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and has expanded its mobile phone network to cover more areas. However, there is still much work to be done to bring the territory's infrastructure up to modern standards and provide reliable services to all residents.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 241 km | Moderate | Main roads are paved, but rural roads are often unpaved and in poor condition |\n| Railways | 0 km | N/A | No rail network exists in American Samoa |\n| Airports | 3 international, 0 domestic | Good | Pago Pago International Airport is the main airport, with flights to Hawaii and other Pacific islands |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | The Port of Pago Pago is the main port, with cargo and passenger services to neighboring islands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- American Samoa relies heavily on imported diesel fuel for power generation, with some renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, being developed.\n- The territory's power grid is relatively reliable, but outages can occur, particularly during storms or when there are technical issues.\n- The American Samoa Power Authority (ASPA) is responsible for managing the territory's energy sector and has been working to improve the efficiency and reliability of the power grid.\n- Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are being promoted as a way to reduce the territory's dependence on imported fossil fuels and lower energy costs.\n- The ASPA has set a goal of generating 50% of the territory's electricity from renewable sources by 2025.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Tap water is generally safe to drink in American Samoa, but there have been issues with water quality in some areas, particularly after heavy rainfall or storms.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with most households having access to modern toilet facilities.\n- However, there are still some areas where sanitation services are limited, particularly in rural villages.\n- The American Samoa Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for monitoring water quality and ensuring that sanitation services meet minimum standards.\n- The government has been working to improve water and sanitation services, particularly in rural areas, with funding from international partners and the US government.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile phone coverage is relatively good in American Samoa, with most areas having access to 3G or 4G services.\n- The territory has two main mobile phone operators, Blue Sky and ASTCA, which offer a range of services, including voice, text, and data.\n- Fiber-optic broadband services are available in some areas, particularly in Pago Pago, but are not yet widely available.\n- The American Samoa Telecommunications Authority (ASTCA) is responsible for regulating the telecommunications sector and has been working to improve the quality and availability of services.\n- There are plans to expand 4G and 5G services to more areas, with funding from international partners and the US government.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The American Samoa Government has launched several major infrastructure development projects, including a new port facility and a renewable energy project.\n- The US government has provided funding for several infrastructure projects, including a new airport terminal and a water treatment plant.\n- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has also provided funding for several infrastructure projects, including a road upgrade and a sanitation improvement project.\n- The government has also been working with private sector partners to develop new infrastructure projects, such as a solar farm and a wind farm.\n- The American Samoa Infrastructure Development Plan outlines the territory's infrastructure development priorities and goals for the next 10 years, including improving roads, energy, water, and telecommunications services.",
