[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in American Samoa is overseen by the American Samoa Department of Health, which provides a range of public health services, including **primary care**, **dental care**, and **public health programs**. However, the quality of care and access to facilities can be limited, especially in rural areas. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be underfunded and understaffed, which can lead to long wait times and limited access to specialized care. Private healthcare providers are also available, but they are relatively expensive and may not be accessible to all members of the community.

In terms of urban vs rural access, the capital city of Pago Pago has the majority of the healthcare facilities, including the LBJ Tropical Medical Center, which is the main hospital in the territory. However, rural areas have limited access to healthcare services, and residents may need to travel to Pago Pago to receive medical attention. The **telemedicine** services are also available in some areas, but the internet connectivity can be a challenge.

The healthcare system in American Samoa faces several challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, limited access to specialized care, and a high burden of **non-communicable diseases**, such as diabetes and heart disease. The territory is also vulnerable to **natural disasters**, such as hurricanes and tsunamis, which can disrupt healthcare services and pose a risk to public health.
