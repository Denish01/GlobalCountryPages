[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
American Samoa, as a territory of the United States, follows a **territorial taxation** system, where only income earned within the territory is subject to taxation. This means that individuals and businesses are not taxed on their worldwide income, but only on the income derived from sources within American Samoa. The residency rules for tax purposes in American Samoa are based on the individual's physical presence in the territory, with a minimum of 183 days required to be considered a resident for tax purposes.

The tax system in American Samoa is relatively simple, with a focus on **income tax** and **corporate tax**. The territory does not have a **VAT** or **GST**, and the tax rates are generally lower compared to other countries. The tax year in American Samoa follows the calendar year, from January to December, and the territory has a limited tax treaty network, with only one country, the United States, having a tax treaty in place.
