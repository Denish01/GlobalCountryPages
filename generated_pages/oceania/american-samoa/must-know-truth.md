American Samoa has a long and complex history, with the first Polynesian settlers arriving around 1000 BC. The islands were uninhabited when European explorers, including Dutch and British sailors, arrived in the 18th century. In 1872, the United States signed a treaty with the local chiefs, establishing a naval station in Pago Pago, which led to the United States' control over the islands. In 1900, the Tripartite Convention of 1899 came into effect, dividing the Samoan Islands between the United States and Germany, with the United States gaining control over the eastern islands, now known as American Samoa. American Samoa has been a United States territory since 1900, with the local government having a significant degree of autonomy.
