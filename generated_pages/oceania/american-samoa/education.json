The public school system is the largest provider of education in American Samoa, with the Department of Education overseeing the administration of schools.

The curriculum is based on the American model, with a focus on core subjects such as English, mathematics, science, and social studies. Students who complete secondary education can go on to pursue tertiary education at the American Samoa Community College, which is the only institution of higher education in the territory. The college offers a range of programs, including associate's degrees and certificate programs, in fields such as business, health sciences, and technology.\n\nThe education system in American Samoa is overseen by the Department of Education, which is responsible for setting policies and standards for schools.
