[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
American Samoa's main international airport is Pago Pago International Airport, which receives flights from nearby islands and the US mainland. The most common direct flight hubs to American Samoa include Honolulu, Hawaii, and Apia, Samoa. There are no overland entry points to American Samoa, as it is an island territory located in the Pacific Ocean. To enter American Samoa, you must arrive by air or sea, with most visitors coming from the United States, Samoa, or other Pacific island nations.

The Pago Pago International Airport is a small but well-maintained facility that offers basic amenities such as food and beverage services, souvenir shops, and currency exchange. Upon arrival, visitors can take a taxi or rent a car to get to their destination, as there are no public transportation options available from the airport. It is also possible to arrive in American Samoa by sea, either by private boat or through cargo ships that occasionally carry passengers.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
American Samoa has a limited domestic air network, with Inter Island Airways being the main airline operating within the territory. The airline offers flights between Pago Pago and the islands of Ofu and Ta'u, which are part of the Manu'a Islands. These flights are relatively frequent, with multiple departures per week, and can be booked in advance through the airline's website or at their office in Pago Pago. Approximate costs for domestic flights in American Samoa range from $100 to $200 per person, depending on the route and time of year.
