[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in American Samoa is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 12, and is provided by both public and private schools. The public school system is the largest provider of education in American Samoa, with the Department of Education overseeing the administration of schools. The quality of education in American Samoa is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on basic skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics. However, there are challenges in terms of limited resources and facilities, particularly in rural areas.

Secondary education is also compulsory, and is provided by both public and private schools. The curriculum is based on the American model, with a focus on core subjects such as English, mathematics, science, and social studies. Students who complete secondary education can go on to pursue tertiary education at the American Samoa Community College, which is the only institution of higher education in the territory. The college offers a range of programs, including associate's degrees and certificate programs, in fields such as business, health sciences, and technology.

The education system in American Samoa is overseen by the Department of Education, which is responsible for setting policies and standards for schools. The department also provides support and resources for teachers and students, including professional development opportunities and educational materials. Despite the challenges faced by the education system, American Samoa has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in literacy rates and student outcomes.
