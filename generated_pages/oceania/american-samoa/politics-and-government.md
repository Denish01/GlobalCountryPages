[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of American Samoa is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by the Governor of American Samoa, who is elected by the people for a four-year term. The legislative branch, known as the American Samoa Fono, is a bicameral body composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The judicial branch is composed of the High Court of American Samoa and the District Court of American Samoa. The government of American Samoa has a significant degree of autonomy, but the US federal government retains authority over matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and some aspects of commerce.

The separation of powers in American Samoa is similar to that of the US federal government, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and checks on the others. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing the laws, the legislative branch is responsible for making the laws, and the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws. American Samoa is a unitary system, with the central government having authority over the entire territory.

The government of American Samoa also has a number of **traditional** institutions, such as the **Fa'a Samoa** (Samoan way of life), which plays an important role in the social and cultural life of the territory. The **Matai** (chiefs) system is also an important part of the traditional governance structure, with **Matai** holding significant authority and influence in their villages and districts.
