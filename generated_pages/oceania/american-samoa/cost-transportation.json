The main transportation modes in the territory include buses, taxis, and ferries, with buses being the most affordable option. However, the quality of public transit is limited, and most people prefer to use their own vehicles or **carpool** with friends and family. The territory's road network is relatively small, with most roads being paved and well-maintained, but traffic can be a problem, especially during peak hours.\n\nThe lack of a well-developed public transportation system makes it difficult for visitors to get around without a car. However, many hotels and resorts offer **shuttle services** to and from the airport, as well as around the island. Additionally, there are several **car rental companies** available, offering a range of vehicles from economy cars to SUVs. It's worth noting that driving in American Samoa can be challenging, especially for those who are not used to driving on the right-hand side of the road.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $60 | Limited coverage, mostly in Pago Pago |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$20 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, fixed rate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-$100 | Economy car, unlimited mileage |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly to rural areas |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | To neighboring islands, limited schedules |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using the public bus system or **carpooling** with friends and family.\n- Be sure to **negotiate taxi fares** before you start your journey, as some taxis may not have meters.\n- If you plan to rent a car, be sure to **check the vehicle's condition** before you drive off the lot.\n- Consider using a **GPS device** or **map app** to help you navigate the territory's roads.\n- Be aware of **traffic rules** and **road conditions**, and always wear a seatbelt when driving or riding in a vehicle.\n- If you're planning to take a domestic flight, be sure to **book in advance** to secure the best rates.",
