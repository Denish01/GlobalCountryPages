[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
American Samoa's economy is classified as an upper-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of over $14,000. The economy is still developing, with a strong reliance on the United States for financial support, including funding for government services and infrastructure development. The territory's remote location and limited natural resources have hindered economic growth, but efforts to diversify the economy and promote private sector development are underway. The economy has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by increases in tuna fishing and canning, as well as a growing tourism sector.

The territory's economic development is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, which provides significant financial support and guidance. American Samoa is not subject to federal income tax, and the local government has implemented various incentives to attract businesses and investments. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global tuna markets and fluctuations in tourism demand.

The government of American Samoa has implemented various initiatives to promote economic development, including efforts to improve the business environment, invest in infrastructure, and support the growth of key industries such as tourism and fisheries. These initiatives aim to reduce the territory's reliance on the United States and promote sustainable economic growth.
