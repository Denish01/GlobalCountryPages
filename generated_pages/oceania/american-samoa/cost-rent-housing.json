The typical lease term for rental properties is 6-12 months, with a security deposit usually equivalent to one month's rent. Tenant rights are protected under the American Samoa law, which requires landlords to provide a safe and habitable living environment. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Samoa and Tonga, American Samoa's housing costs are relatively high due to its proximity to the United States and the resulting higher cost of living.\n\nThe rental market in American Samoa is also influenced by the presence of the US military and government agencies, which can drive up demand for housing and push up prices. However, for those who are willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available, particularly in the suburbs and rural areas. It's worth noting that the housing market in American Samoa is not as developed as in other US territories, and the availability of certain amenities and services may be limited.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | 500-700 | 300-500 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | 600-900 | 400-700 | typical quality, 1 bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | 900-1,400 | 600-1,000 | family size, 2 bathrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | 1,200-1,800 | 800-1,400 | spacious, 2-3 bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | 1,500-2,500 | prime locations, ocean views |\n| Suburbs | 1,000-2,000 | residential areas, some amenities |\n| Rural | 500-1,500 | limited amenities, natural surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Fagatogo**: a central neighborhood with a range of accommodation options, including apartments and houses, with rent prices ranging from $600 to $1,200 per month.\n- **Utulei**: a coastal neighborhood with stunning ocean views, offering a mix of apartments and houses, with rent prices ranging from $800 to $1,500 per month.\n- **Tafuna**: a suburban neighborhood with a range of housing options, including apartments and houses, with rent prices ranging from $400 to $1,000 per month.\n- ** Leone**: a rural neighborhood with limited amenities, but offering a peaceful and natural environment, with rent prices ranging from $300 to $800 per month.\n- **Afono**: a rural neighborhood with stunning natural surroundings, offering a range of housing options, including apartments and houses, with rent prices ranging from $400 to $1,000 per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for American Samoa [/SECTION]\n- Research thoroughly: it's essential to research the local rental market and understand the prices and conditions before signing a lease.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent: a good agent can help you find the right accommodation and negotiate a fair price.\n- Be prepared to act quickly: the rental market in American Samoa can be competitive, so be prepared to act quickly when you find a suitable property.\n- Check the condition of the property: make sure to inspect the property carefully before signing a lease, and negotiate any necessary repairs or renovations.\n- Understand the lease terms: make sure you understand the terms of the lease, including the length of the lease, the rent, and any other conditions.\n- Consider the location: think carefully about the location of the property, and whether it is convenient for your work, school, or other activities.",
