[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The housing market in American Samoa is relatively small and limited, with a high demand for rental properties, particularly in the city center of Pago Pago. The typical lease term for rental properties is 6-12 months, with a security deposit usually equivalent to one month's rent. Tenant rights are protected under the American Samoa law, which requires landlords to provide a safe and habitable living environment. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Samoa and Tonga, American Samoa's housing costs are relatively high due to its proximity to the United States and the resulting higher cost of living.

The rental market in American Samoa is also influenced by the presence of the US military and government agencies, which can drive up demand for housing and push up prices. However, for those who are willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available, particularly in the suburbs and rural areas. It's worth noting that the housing market in American Samoa is not as developed as in other US territories, and the availability of certain amenities and services may be limited.
