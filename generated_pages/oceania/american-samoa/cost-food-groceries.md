[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in American Samoa are driven up by the territory's remote location, which results in high transportation costs for imported goods. Additionally, the local economy is heavily reliant on imports, which can lead to price fluctuations. Despite these factors, eating out is a popular activity in American Samoa, with many restaurants serving traditional Samoan dishes such as fa'ausi (steamed dumplings) and palusami (steamed taro and coconut cream). However, home cooking is also a common practice, with many locals preferring to prepare their own meals using fresh ingredients from the market or their own gardens.

The eating-out culture in American Samoa is influenced by the territory's cultural heritage, with many restaurants serving traditional Samoan dishes alongside international cuisine. However, the high cost of food can be a challenge for locals and visitors alike, with many opting to cook their own meals or seek out affordable options at local eateries. To save money, it's a good idea to eat at local restaurants or food stalls, which often serve traditional dishes at lower prices than mid-range or fine dining establishments.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, American Samoa has a mix of supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets like Cost-U-Less and Samoa Mart offer a wide range of imported goods, but at a higher price point than local markets. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional Samoan ingredients at lower prices. However, the selection may be limited, and the quality can vary. To save money, it's a good idea to shop at local markets for fresh produce and staples like rice and bread, and reserve supermarket shopping for imported goods or specialty items.

In terms of price difference, local markets can offer significant savings on fresh produce and traditional ingredients. For example, a kilogram of tomatoes may cost $3-$5 at a supermarket, but only $2-$3 at a local market. However, the quality and selection may vary, and some items may not be available at local markets. To get the best value, it's a good idea to shop around and compare prices between supermarkets and local markets. Additionally, bargaining is not typically practiced in American Samoa, so it's best to accept the stated price or shop elsewhere.
