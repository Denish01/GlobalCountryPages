However, the cost of utilities can be subject to fluctuations due to factors such as fuel prices and seasonal variation in demand. During the summer months, electricity demand tends to increase due to the use of air conditioning, which can lead to higher bills. On the other hand, the cost of water is relatively stable, with a fixed rate per gallon.\n\nThe overall quality of the utility infrastructure in American Samoa is good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, there may be occasional outages or disruptions due to maintenance or natural disasters. The ASPA is responsible for maintaining and upgrading the utility infrastructure, and it has implemented various initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities in American Samoa remains relatively high compared to other territories or states in the United States.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $100 | $150 | $200 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | not commonly used |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in water bill |\n| **Total** | **$130** | **$195** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10-20 Mbps | Bluesky, ASTCA |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-120 | 60-100 Mbps | Bluesky, ASTCA |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-30 | 1-10 GB | Bluesky, ASTCA |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-60 | 10-20 GB | Bluesky, ASTCA |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $100-200 | varies | Bluesky, ASTCA |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $13.99 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $9.99 | |\n| Local Streaming | $10 | Tapasui TV, local content |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in American Samoa, residents typically need to contact the ASPA and provide proof of identity and address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience.\n- Bluesky and ASTCA are the main internet service providers in American Samoa, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and taking advantage of time-of-use pricing for electricity.\n- It is also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure that you are getting the best rates and services for your needs.",
