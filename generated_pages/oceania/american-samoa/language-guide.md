[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
American Samoa's linguistic landscape is characterized by the widespread use of Samoan, which is the native language of the islands. Samoan is a Polynesian language that is closely related to other languages spoken in the Pacific, such as Tongan and Fijian. English is also widely spoken, particularly in business, education, and tourism, due to the territory's historical ties with the United States. There are also smaller communities of people who speak other Pacific languages, such as Tokelauan and Tuvaluan. Regional dialects of Samoan are also present, with some variations in vocabulary and pronunciation between different villages and islands. Overall, American Samoa's language situation is characterized by a high degree of bilingualism, with many people speaking both Samoan and English fluently.

The use of English in American Samoa is widespread, particularly in formal settings such as government, education, and business. However, Samoan is still the predominant language in many everyday situations, such as in traditional ceremonies, family gatherings, and informal conversations. Visitors to American Samoa will often find that they can communicate effectively in English, particularly in tourist areas and with younger people. However, learning some basic Samoan phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people.

In addition to Samoan and English, there are also some minority languages spoken in American Samoa, including Tokelauan and Tuvaluan. These languages are spoken by smaller communities of people who have migrated to American Samoa from other Pacific islands. While these languages are not as widely spoken as Samoan and English, they are still an important part of the territory's linguistic diversity.
