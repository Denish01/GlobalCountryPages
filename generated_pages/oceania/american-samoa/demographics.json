  "content": "The population of American Samoa is approximately 49,710 people, comprising a unique blend of indigenous and American cultures, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 0.05 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.3%\nMedian Age: 24.5 years\nUrban Population: 87%\nPopulation Density: 249 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 73 years\nFertility Rate: 2.5 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nAmerican Samoa has a relatively small population, with a total area of 199 km², making it one of the most densely populated territories in the Pacific. The population has been growing steadily over the years, with a growth rate of 0.3%, although this growth is largely driven by natural increase rather than migration. The majority of the population, approximately 87%, resides in urban areas, with the capital city Pago Pago being the largest urban center. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 24.5 years, and the fertility rate is around 2.5 children per woman.\n\nThe population of American Samoa is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the territory and to other countries, particularly the United States. Many American Samoans migrate to the US mainland for education, employment, or military service, and some eventually return to the territory, bringing with them new skills, ideas, and cultural practices. This migration has contributed to the unique cultural landscape of American Samoa, with a blend of traditional Samoan and American influences.\n\nThe population size of American Samoa is relatively small compared to other Pacific Island territories, and the government has implemented various measures to promote population growth and development, including investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. However, the territory still faces challenges related to population growth, including limited job opportunities, overcrowding, and pressure on natural resources.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Samoan | 92.6% | Indigenous | Native people of American Samoa |\n| Asian | 3.5% | Immigrant | Mostly from China, Korea, and the Philippines |\n| Caucasian | 1.3% | Immigrant | Mostly from the United States |\n| Pacific Islander | 1.2% | Immigrant | From other Pacific Island countries |\n| Mixed | 1.4% | Indigenous/Immigrant | Mixed ancestry, including Samoan and other ethnic groups |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic landscape of American Samoa is dominated by the indigenous Samoan population, which accounts for approximately 92.6% of the total population. The remaining population consists of Asian, Caucasian, and other Pacific Islander groups, who have migrated to the territory for various reasons, including economic opportunities, education, or family ties. The ethnic relations in American Samoa are generally harmonious, with a strong emphasis on traditional Samoan culture and values, although there are also efforts to promote diversity and inclusivity.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Samoan** is the official language and the most widely spoken language in American Samoa, with approximately 90% of the population speaking it as their first language.\n- English is also an official language and is widely spoken, particularly in formal settings, such as government, education, and business.\n- Other languages spoken in American Samoa include **Tongan**, **Tokelauan**, and **Fijian**, which are spoken by immigrant communities from other Pacific Island countries.\n- **Chamorro** is also spoken by some people, particularly those with ancestral ties to Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands.\n- American Samoa has a language preservation program, which aims to promote the use of Samoan language and culture, particularly among young people.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Christian | 98.3% | Mostly Congregationalist, Catholic, and Methodist |\n| Bahai | 0.5% | Small but growing community |\n| Islam | 0.2% | Small Muslim community, mostly immigrant |\n| Other | 1% | Including traditional Samoan spirituality and other faiths |\n[/TABLE]\nThe majority of the population in American Samoa, approximately 98.3%, identifies as Christian, with the Congregationalist, Catholic, and Methodist denominations being the largest. The territory has a strong tradition of religious freedom, and there are also smaller communities of Bahai, Muslims, and other faiths. The Christian churches play an important role in American Samoan society, with many churches serving as community centers, schools, and social service providers.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 29.5% | High dependency ratio, pressure on education and healthcare services |\n| 15-24 | 20.5% | Large youth population, potential for labor market entry and migration |\n| 25-54 | 43.5% | Working-age population, driving economic growth and development |\n| 55-64 | 4.5% | Aging population, potential for increased healthcare costs and social security concerns |\n| 65+ | 2% | Small but growing elderly population, potential for increased social security and healthcare needs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- The majority of the population, approximately 87%, resides in urban areas, with Pago Pago being the largest urban center.\n- **Pago Pago** is the capital city and the economic hub of American Samoa, with a population of around 15,000 people.\n- **Fagatogo** is another major urban center, with a population of around 5,000 people, and serves as the seat of government.\n- **Tafuna** is a growing urban area, with a population of around 10,000 people, and is home to the territory's international airport.\n- The urban-rural split in American Samoa is significant, with many rural areas experiencing out-migration to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities and services.",
