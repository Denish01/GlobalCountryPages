[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
American Samoa has a relatively small population, with a total area of 199 km², making it one of the most densely populated territories in the Pacific. The population has been growing steadily over the years, with a growth rate of 0.3%, although this growth is largely driven by natural increase rather than migration. The majority of the population, approximately 87%, resides in urban areas, with the capital city Pago Pago being the largest urban center. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 24.5 years, and the fertility rate is around 2.5 children per woman.

The population of American Samoa is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the territory and to other countries, particularly the United States. Many American Samoans migrate to the US mainland for education, employment, or military service, and some eventually return to the territory, bringing with them new skills, ideas, and cultural practices. This migration has contributed to the unique cultural landscape of American Samoa, with a blend of traditional Samoan and American influences.

The population size of American Samoa is relatively small compared to other Pacific Island territories, and the government has implemented various measures to promote population growth and development, including investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. However, the territory still faces challenges related to population growth, including limited job opportunities, overcrowding, and pressure on natural resources.
