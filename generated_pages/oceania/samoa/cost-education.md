[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Samoa is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools in Samoa are generally free or subsidized, and the quality of education is considered to be good, with a focus on the Samoan language and culture. However, private schools, which are mostly run by churches or other organizations, are considered to be of higher quality and offer a more Western-style education. The language of instruction in public schools is Samoan, while private schools may use English or a combination of both languages. Compulsory education in Samoa lasts for 8 years, from age 5 to 13, and international schools are available for expatriate children, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate or the Cambridge International Examinations.

The quality of education in Samoa is generally considered to be good, with a strong focus on literacy and numeracy. However, there are some challenges, such as a shortage of qualified teachers and a lack of resources, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, Samoa has made significant progress in improving its education system, with a literacy rate of around 90%. International schools in Samoa offer a range of curricula and are popular among expatriate families, providing a high-quality education and a range of extracurricular activities.
