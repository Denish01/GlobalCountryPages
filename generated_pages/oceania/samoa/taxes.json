The Samoa Revenue Office is responsible for administering the tax system and providing guidance to taxpayers.

Taxpayers who fail to file their tax returns on time may be subject to penalties and interest.\n\n[SECTION] Personal Income Tax [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Income Bracket (WST) | Tax Rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 - 15,000 | 0% |\n| 15,001 - 30,000 | 10% |\n| 30,001 - 50,000 | 15% |\n| 50,001 - 80,000 | 20% |\n| 80,001 and over | 27% |\n[/TABLE]\nPersonal income tax in Samoa is subject to a progressive tax system, with higher income earners paying a higher tax rate.
