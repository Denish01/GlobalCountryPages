[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main entry point to Samoa is Faleolo International Airport, located about 35 kilometers west of Apia, the capital city. Direct flights to Samoa are available from major airports in Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, as well as from neighboring Pacific island nations. You can fly to Samoa with airlines such as Air New Zealand, Fiji Airways, and Virgin Australia. Overland entry points are limited, as Samoa is an island nation, but you can also arrive by sea on a cruise ship or a private yacht.

If you are traveling from the United States or Europe, you will likely need to connect through a major airport in the Asia-Pacific region, such as Auckland or Nadi. It's a good idea to research and book your flights in advance, especially during peak travel seasons. Additionally, consider purchasing travel insurance that covers unexpected trip cancellations or interruptions.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Samoa has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting the main islands of Upolu and Savai'i. The main domestic airline is Samoa Airways, which operates flights between Apia and Salelologa on Savai'i. You can book domestic flights online or through a local travel agent. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 USD for a one-way ticket, depending on the time of year and availability. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best prices.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Samoa has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. You will need to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals. This can be a good opportunity to see the scenic countryside and interact with locals, but it may also take longer to get to your destination.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses are a common form of transportation in Samoa, with several companies operating intercity routes. The main bus companies are Samoa Public Transport Corporation and Savai'i Express, which connect Apia to other towns and villages on Upolu and Savai'i. Bus fares are relatively affordable, ranging from $1 to $5 USD for a one-way ticket, depending on the distance. However, bus schedules can be limited, and the quality of the buses may vary.
