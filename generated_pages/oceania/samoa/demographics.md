[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Samoa's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in the Pacific region, but it has been steadily growing over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 0.6%, which is a relatively slow rate compared to other developing countries. The urban population accounts for around 35.4% of the total population, with the majority of people living in rural areas. The population is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that the population will reach around 250,000 by 2030. Urbanization is a significant trend in Samoa, with many young people moving to the capital city Apia in search of better job opportunities and access to education and healthcare.

The population of Samoa is also characterized by a high level of migration, with many Samoans living and working abroad, particularly in New Zealand and Australia. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with estimates suggesting that there are over 100,000 people of Samoan descent living in New Zealand alone. Remittances from these migrant workers are an important source of income for many families in Samoa.

In terms of population trends, Samoa's population is relatively young, with a median age of 22.4 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is of working age and is expected to contribute to the workforce. However, it also poses challenges in terms of providing education, healthcare, and other social services to a growing population.
