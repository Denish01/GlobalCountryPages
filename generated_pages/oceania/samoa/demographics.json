  "content": "The population of Samoa is approximately 205,557 people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that shape the country's unique cultural identity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 0.22 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.6%\nMedian Age: 22.4 years\nUrban Population: 35.4%\nPopulation Density: 72 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 73.4 years\nFertility Rate: 3.9 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nSamoa's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in the Pacific region, but it has been steadily growing over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 0.6%, which is a relatively slow rate compared to other developing countries. The urban population accounts for around 35.4% of the total population, with the majority of people living in rural areas. The population is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that the population will reach around 250,000 by 2030. Urbanization is a significant trend in Samoa, with many young people moving to the capital city Apia in search of better job opportunities and access to education and healthcare.\n\nThe population of Samoa is also characterized by a high level of migration, with many Samoans living and working abroad, particularly in New Zealand and Australia. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with estimates suggesting that there are over 100,000 people of Samoan descent living in New Zealand alone. Remittances from these migrant workers are an important source of income for many families in Samoa.\n\nIn terms of population trends, Samoa's population is relatively young, with a median age of 22.4 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is of working age and is expected to contribute to the workforce. However, it also poses challenges in terms of providing education, healthcare, and other social services to a growing population.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Samoan | 92.6% | Nationwide | Indigenous Polynesian people |\n| Euronesian | 3.5% | Urban areas | Mixed European and Polynesian ancestry |\n| European | 2.1% | Urban areas | Mainly of European descent |\n| East Asian | 1.2% | Urban areas | Mainly of Chinese and Korean descent |\n| Other Pacific | 0.6% | Urban areas | Mainly from other Pacific Island countries |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Samoa are characterized by a diverse mix of indigenous and non-indigenous populations. The Samoan people make up the majority of the population, and are the indigenous Polynesian people of the islands. There are also significant minority groups, including Euronesians, Europeans, and East Asians, who have settled in the country over the years. The ethnic relations in Samoa are generally harmonious, with a strong sense of national identity and a respect for cultural diversity. However, there are also challenges related to the preservation of traditional Samoan culture and the integration of minority groups into Samoan society.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Samoan** is the official language and is spoken by the majority of the population\n- English is also an official language and is widely spoken, particularly in urban areas and among the educated population\n- Other languages spoken in Samoa include **Tongan** and **Fijian**, which are spoken by minority groups\n- **Tokelauan** is also spoken by a small minority group\n- There are also several **regional dialects** of Samoan, which are spoken in different parts of the country\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Christian | 98.3% | Mainly Congregationalist and Catholic |\n| Other | 1.2% | Includes Bahai, Hindu, and Muslim |\n| No religion | 0.5% | Includes atheist and agnostic |\n[/TABLE]\nThe majority of the population in Samoa is Christian, with around 98.3% of the population identifying as Christian. The main Christian denominations are Congregationalist and Catholic, which have a significant influence on the country's culture and social norms. There are also smaller minority groups of other religions, including Bahai, Hindu, and Muslim.

However, there are also challenges related to the preservation of traditional Samoan spiritual practices and the integration of minority religious groups into Samoan society.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 29.4% | High demand for education and healthcare services |\n| 15-24 | 20.5% | High youth unemployment and migration rates |\n| 25-54 | 43.2% | Large workforce and high productivity |\n| 55-64 | 5.3% | Increasing demand for healthcare and social services |\n| 65+ | 1.6% | Increasing demand for elderly care and social services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- The urban population in Samoa is around 35.4%, with the majority of people living in the capital city **Apia**\n- The fastest-growing cities in Samoa are **Apia** and **Asau**, which are experiencing rapid urbanization and development\n- The **diaspora community** is a significant factor in Samoa's population trends, with many Samoans living and working abroad\n- The main **migration trends** are to New Zealand and Australia, where many Samoans have settled in search of better job opportunities and education\n- The **urban-rural split** is a significant challenge in Samoa, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services and infrastructure.",
