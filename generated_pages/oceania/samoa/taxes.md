[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Samoa has a **territorial tax system**, which means that only income earned within Samoa is subject to tax, except for certain types of income that are taxed on a **worldwide basis**, such as income earned by Samoan residents from foreign sources. Residency rules for tax purposes in Samoa are based on the number of days spent in the country, with individuals who spend more than 183 days in a 12-month period considered tax residents. This means that expats and foreign workers who live and work in Samoa for an extended period may be subject to tax on their worldwide income.

The tax system in Samoa is relatively straightforward, with a focus on simplicity and ease of compliance. The Samoa Revenue Office is responsible for administering the tax system and providing guidance to taxpayers. The tax year in Samoa runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of April following the end of the tax year. Taxpayers who fail to file their tax returns on time may be subject to penalties and interest.
