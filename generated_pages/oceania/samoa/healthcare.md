[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Samoa is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The public sector is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost healthcare services to citizens, while the private sector provides more specialized and expensive services. The quality of care in Samoa is generally adequate, but it can vary greatly between urban and rural areas. In urban areas, such as Apia, there are more healthcare providers and better-equipped facilities, while in rural areas, healthcare services are often limited and may require patients to travel long distances to access care. The Samoan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding and investing in new equipment and facilities.

The public healthcare system in Samoa is based on a **district hospital** model, with each district having its own hospital that provides a range of services, including emergency care, surgery, and maternity care. There are also several **health centers** and **clinics** located throughout the country, which provide primary healthcare services, such as vaccinations, health checks, and treatment for minor illnesses. In addition to the public sector, there are several private hospitals and clinics in Samoa, which provide more specialized and expensive services, such as **private rooms** and **specialist consultations**.

Overall, the healthcare system in Samoa is working to provide adequate care to its citizens, but there are still challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas. The government and healthcare providers are working to improve the system, including increasing access to healthcare services and improving the quality of care.
