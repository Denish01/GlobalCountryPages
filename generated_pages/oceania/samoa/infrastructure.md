# Samoa Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Samoa is relatively developed, with a focus on improving road networks, energy generation, and telecommunications, although there are still significant gaps between urban and rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 35%
Road Network: 2,042 km, moderate quality with some paved and many unpaved roads
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 1 international, 3 domestic
Major Ports: 2 major ports, Apia and Asau
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Samoa has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving the quality of life for its citizens and supporting economic growth. The country has invested heavily in upgrading its road network, with a number of major projects completed or underway, including the reconstruction of the Apia to Faleolo Road and the upgrading of the Cross Island Road. However, there are still significant gaps between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has also prioritized the development of the tourism sector, with investments in airport and port infrastructure.

Despite these efforts, Samoa's infrastructure still faces a number of challenges, including vulnerability to natural disasters such as cyclones and tsunamis. The country is also heavily reliant on imported fuel, which can be expensive and subject to price fluctuations. To address these challenges, the government has been working to develop more sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including the use of renewable energy sources and the implementation of disaster-risk reduction measures.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant issue in Samoa, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address this gap, with investments in rural infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and water supply systems. However, more needs to be done to ensure that all communities have access to the services and opportunities they need to thrive.
