However, the costs of these services can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the peak tourist season (June to September) leading to increased prices. The Samoan government has implemented measures to stabilize utility costs, including subsidies for low-income households and investments in renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, utility costs can still be a significant expense for households, particularly for those with high energy consumption.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Samoa is generally good, with electricity and water services available 24/7 in most areas. However, there can be occasional disruptions to services due to natural disasters, such as cyclones, or maintenance work. The government and utility providers are working to improve the resilience and reliability of utility services, including the development of backup power systems and the implementation of smart grid technologies.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (not commonly used) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in electricity bill) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$140** | **$200** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10-20 Mbps | Bluesky, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 50-100 Mbps | Bluesky, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Bluesky, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Bluesky, Digicel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Bluesky, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Samoa Broadcasting Corporation) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, contact the provider at least 2 weeks in advance to schedule a connection.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a cost-effective option for households with low energy consumption.\n- Bluesky and Digicel are the main internet and phone providers in Samoa, offering a range of plans and services.\n- To save on utility bills, households can implement energy-efficient measures, such as using LED lighting and reducing water consumption.\n- Consider bundling phone and internet services to get a discounted rate.",
