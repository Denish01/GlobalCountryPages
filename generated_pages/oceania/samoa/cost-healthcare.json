  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Samoa can vary depending on the type of service and provider, with public healthcare services generally being more affordable than private ones, and the estimated cost of a doctor's visit ranging from $20 to $100.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $293\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 13.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 999\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: WST\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSamoa's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities, particularly in the capital city of Apia. However, the system can be underfunded and understaffed at times, which can lead to delays and limitations in the availability of certain services. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the first point of contact for medical care, and services are generally subsidized by the government. For foreigners, private healthcare providers may be a better option, as they often offer higher-quality facilities and more specialized services, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe need for health insurance in Samoa is recommended, particularly for foreigners, as the cost of medical care can be high, especially for specialized services or hospital stays. While the public healthcare system is generally affordable, it may not provide the same level of service or expertise as private providers, and insurance can help to cover the cost of private medical care. Additionally, some medical services, such as specialist consultations or surgical procedures, may only be available at private facilities, making insurance a necessary consideration for those who want to access these services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics are generally cheaper, but may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Specialist services may only be available at private facilities |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Private dental clinics may offer more specialized services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Optometrists may be available at public clinics, but private clinics may offer more advanced services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Private labs may offer faster turnaround times and more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times, but are generally cheaper |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may offer more luxurious amenities and better service |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Specialist surgeries, such as orthopedic or cardiac procedures, may be more expensive |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,500 | Private hospitals may offer more personalized care and amenities |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Private imaging centers may offer more advanced technology and faster turnaround times |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may offer cheaper imaging services, but with longer wait times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers public hospital stays, GP visits, and basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers private hospital stays, specialist consultations, and advanced medical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical evacuation, repatriation, and international medical care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, are generally available at public pharmacies and cost between $5-$20\n- Prescription medications, such as blood pressure medication or asthma inhalers, may be more expensive and cost between $20-$50 per month\n- Private pharmacies may offer a wider range of medications and more personalized service, but at a higher cost\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as cold and flu remedies, are generally available at public pharmacies and cost between $10-$30\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, and medications may only be available with a doctor's prescription\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number, 999, or visit the nearest hospital. The public hospital in Apia, the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital, is generally well-equipped to handle emergency cases, but may have limited resources and long wait times. Private hospitals, such as the Samoa Medical Council Hospital, may offer more advanced emergency services and better facilities, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical care, such as insurance or a medical evacuation plan, as the cost of emergency care can be high and medical facilities may be limited. Additionally, it is a good idea to research the best hospitals for foreigners in Samoa and to have a list of emergency contact numbers, such as the embassy or consulate, in case of an emergency.",
