Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Samoa Land Titles Registration Act 2008, which provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Tonga and American Samoa, Samoa's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a mix of traditional and modern accommodation options available.\n\nThe housing market in Samoa is influenced by the country's growing economy, with a increasing demand for housing from both locals and expatriates. However, the supply of housing is limited, particularly in the capital city, which can drive up prices. The government has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new subdivisions and the provision of subsidies for low-income households. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Samoa remains relatively expensive, particularly for low-income households.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$300 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$600 | $250-$400 | modern appliances, private bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $400-$600 | family size, fully furnished |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,200 | $600-$900 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, commercial areas |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | agricultural land, traditional villages |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Vaitele: $400-$600 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a modern suburb with amenities and services\n- Apia Central: $500-$800 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a bustling commercial area with restaurants and shops\n- Vailima: $300-$500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a scenic suburb with a mix of traditional and modern housing\n- Faleasiu: $250-$400 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a coastal village with a laid-back atmosphere\n- Malifa: $350-$550 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a residential area with a mix of Samoan and expat families\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Samoa [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and compare prices before signing a lease\n- Inspect the property carefully before moving in, and document any damage or issues\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, if possible\n- Be aware of scams and fake listings, and only deal with reputable real estate agents or landlords\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, and tenants are responsible for paying these bills separately\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, and tenants may need to provide their own appliances and furniture",
