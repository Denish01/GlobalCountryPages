        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Samoa is a sovereign island nation with a lower-middle-income economy. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing GDP and a relatively stable economy. However, Samoa still faces challenges such as a narrow economic base, dependence on remittances, and vulnerability to natural disasters. The economy is primarily driven by the services sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP. The government has been working to diversify the economy, promote private sector growth, and improve the business environment.</p>
        <p>Samoa's economic development is also influenced by its strategic location in the Pacific region. The country has a unique cultural identity and a strong sense of community, which are essential components of its economic development strategy. The government has been implementing policies to promote sustainable economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the standard of living for its citizens. Despite the challenges, Samoa has the potential to become a thriving economy in the Pacific region, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing.</p>
