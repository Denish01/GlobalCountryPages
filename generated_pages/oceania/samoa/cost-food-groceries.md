[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Samoa are driven by the country's remote location and reliance on imported goods, which contributes to higher costs. The inflation rate of 2.2% in 2024 also affects food prices, making it essential for consumers to be mindful of their spending. Eating out is a popular activity in Samoa, with many restaurants and cafes offering a range of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also a significant part of Samoan culture, with many families preparing traditional dishes using fresh ingredients from their gardens or local markets. The cost of eating out versus cooking at home can vary significantly, with a meal at a mid-range restaurant costing around $30-$50 USD for two people, while a similar meal prepared at home can cost around $10-$20 USD.

The **GDP per capita PPP** of $8,737 in 2024 indicates a relatively high standard of living in Samoa, which can contribute to higher food prices. Additionally, the country's **education spend** of 5.5% of GDP and **health expenditure per capita** of $293 in 2023 may also influence food prices, as a significant portion of the population's income is allocated towards these essential services. Furthermore, the **out-of-pocket health spend** of 13.4% in 2023 may also affect food prices, as individuals may need to allocate a portion of their income towards healthcare expenses.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
Prices at supermarkets and local markets in Samoa can vary significantly, with supermarkets generally offering a wider range of products at higher prices. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional Samoan ingredients at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of tomatoes can cost around $2.50 USD at a supermarket, while at a local market, it can cost around $1.50 USD. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to bargain and negotiate prices, as vendors often expect customers to haggle. Supermarkets, on the other hand, have fixed prices, and customers can expect to pay the listed price.

When shopping for groceries in Samoa, it's best to buy fresh produce, meat, and seafood at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods, dairy products, and imported items. Some popular local markets include the Apia Market and the Savalalo Market, which offer a wide range of fresh produce, handicrafts, and traditional Samoan goods. Supermarkets like Frankies Supermarket and Samoa Shopper's Discount Store offer a wider range of products, including international brands and imported goods.
