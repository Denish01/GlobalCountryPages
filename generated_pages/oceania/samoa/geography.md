[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Samoa is an island nation located in the southern Pacific Ocean, approximately halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand. It is situated in the region of Oceania, and its geographic coordinates are between 13° and 15° south latitude and 171° and 173° west longitude. The country is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the north, south, east, and west, and it shares a maritime border with American Samoa to the east and Tonga to the southwest.

Samoa is an archipelago, consisting of two main islands: Upolu and Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, is located on the northern coast of Upolu, and it is the country's largest city and commercial center. The country's strategic location in the Pacific makes it an important stopover for international shipping and air travel. Samoa's borders are mostly composed of coastline, with a total length of 403 kilometers, and its maritime borders are defined by the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Samoa's terrain is characterized by volcanic mountains, rugged coastlines, and coral reefs. The interior of the islands is mountainous, with many peaks exceeding 1,000 meters in elevation. The highest point, Mount Silisili, is located on the island of Savai'i and reaches an elevation of 1,858 meters. The mountains are covered in lush tropical rainforests, which provide habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna. The coastlines are generally rocky and steep, with many small beaches and bays.

The islands are also home to several major rivers, including the Falefa River and the Vaisigano River, which flow through the interior and provide water for irrigation and drinking. The coastal areas are generally flat and narrow, with many small villages and towns located along the shoreline. The coral reefs that surround the islands are home to a diverse array of marine life, including fish, sea turtles, and coral species. The unique combination of volcanic mountains, rainforests, and coral reefs makes Samoa a **biodiversity hotspot**, with many endemic species found nowhere else in the world.

The islands' landscapes have been shaped by volcanic activity, tectonic movement, and erosion over millions of years. The volcanic rocks that make up the islands are rich in minerals, including copper, gold, and silver, which have been mined in the past. The islands' rugged terrain and dense rainforests also make them prone to natural disasters, such as landslides, floods, and cyclones.
