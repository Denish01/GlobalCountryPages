[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Samoa has improved significantly in recent years, with the average internet speed increasing to 5 Mbps download, making it suitable for general browsing, email, and social media. However, the urban-rural divide is still evident, with faster and more reliable connections available in Apia and other urban areas, while rural regions often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in Samoa is generally good, with most providers offering stable connections, but occasional outages can occur, especially during severe weather conditions.

Despite these challenges, the Samoan government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the rollout of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks. As a result, visitors can expect to find decent internet connections in most tourist areas, including hotels, cafes, and restaurants. However, it's still important to be prepared for occasional disruptions and to have a backup plan, such as a portable Wi-Fi hotspot or a local SIM card.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Samoa, visitors can purchase one from a local provider, such as Digicel, Vodafone, or Bluesky, at their respective stores or authorized dealers. The process typically requires a valid passport and proof of address, and the cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable provider, as they often offer better coverage and more competitive data plans. Data plans vary in price and data allowance, but most providers offer affordable options, including daily, weekly, and monthly plans.
