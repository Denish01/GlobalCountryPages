[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Samoa is based on a system of **separation of powers**, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **executive branch** is headed by the O le Ao o le Malo, who serves as the head of state, while the **Prime Minister** is the head of government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Legislative Assembly, a unicameral body with 51 seats. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, and the District Court.

The political system in Samoa is characterized by a **unitary** structure, with a central government responsible for making and enforcing laws. The government is also **decentralized**, with some powers and responsibilities devolved to local authorities, such as village councils. The **separation of powers** is designed to provide checks and balances on the exercise of power, and to prevent any one branch of government from dominating the others.

The **political culture** in Samoa is influenced by traditional values and customs, with a strong emphasis on **consensus-building** and **consultation**. The government is expected to work in the best interests of the people, and to be accountable to the **Legislative Assembly** and the **electorate**.
