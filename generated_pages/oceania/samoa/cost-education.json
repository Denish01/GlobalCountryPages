Public schools in Samoa are generally free or subsidized, and the quality of education is considered to be good, with a focus on the Samoan language and culture. However, private schools, which are mostly run by churches or other organizations, are considered to be of higher quality and offer a more Western-style education. The language of instruction in public schools is Samoan, while private schools may use English or a combination of both languages. Compulsory education in Samoa lasts for 8 years, from age 5 to 13, and international schools are available for expatriate children, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate or the Cambridge International Examinations.\n\nThe quality of education in Samoa is generally considered to be good, with a strong focus on literacy and numeracy. However, there are some challenges, such as a shortage of qualified teachers and a lack of resources, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, Samoa has made significant progress in improving its education system, with a literacy rate of around 90%. International schools in Samoa offer a range of curricula and are popular among expatriate families, providing a high-quality education and a range of extracurricular activities.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Good quality, Samoan language of instruction |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Range by tier, English language of instruction |\n| Public Secondary | $100-$300 (subsidized) | Good quality, Samoan language of instruction |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Range by tier, English language of instruction |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | IB or Cambridge curriculum, high-quality facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | National University of Samoa |\n| Private University | $2,000-$4,000 | $3,000-$5,000 | Limited options, mostly theological colleges |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,500-$4,000 | $3,500-$5,500 | National University of Samoa, limited programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited options, mostly in Apia |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Limited availability, mostly for English language |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$200 | Samoan language courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, including uniforms |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for all schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The National University of Samoa is the top-ranked university in the country, offering a range of programs, including business, education, and health sciences.\n- International schools in Samoa, such as the Robert Louis Stevenson School, offer high-quality education and are popular among expatriate families.\n- Scholarship opportunities are limited, but available for local students, particularly for those studying at the National University of Samoa.\n- Online learning options are limited in Samoa, but some universities offer distance learning programs, particularly for postgraduate studies.\n- Education quality in Samoa is generally considered to be good, but there are some challenges, such as a shortage of qualified teachers and a lack of resources, particularly in rural areas.\n- Expatriate families should research international schools carefully, considering factors such as curriculum, facilities, and extracurricular activities, to ensure the best education for their children.",
