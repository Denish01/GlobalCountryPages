[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Samoa is relatively small, with a limited supply of modern apartments and houses, particularly in the capital city of Apia. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Samoa Land Titles Registration Act 2008, which provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Tonga and American Samoa, Samoa's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a mix of traditional and modern accommodation options available.

The housing market in Samoa is influenced by the country's growing economy, with a increasing demand for housing from both locals and expatriates. However, the supply of housing is limited, particularly in the capital city, which can drive up prices. The government has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new subdivisions and the provision of subsidies for low-income households. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Samoa remains relatively expensive, particularly for low-income households.
