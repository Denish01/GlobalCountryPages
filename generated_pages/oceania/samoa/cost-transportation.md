[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The main transportation modes in Samoa include buses, taxis, and ferries, with most people relying on public transportation or walking to get around. The quality of public transit in Samoa is relatively good, with buses and taxis readily available, although the network can be limited in rural areas. The country's road network is also relatively well-maintained, making it easy to get around by car or taxi.

Samoa's public transportation system is affordable and convenient, with buses and taxis operating on a regular schedule. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in rural areas can make it difficult for people to get around without a car. The government has been working to improve the public transportation system, including the introduction of new bus services and the upgrading of roads.
