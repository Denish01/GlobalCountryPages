Norfolk Island is a self-governing territory of Australia, with a strong focus on tourism and a relatively high standard of living. New Caledonia, on the other hand, is a special collectivity of France, with a more diverse economy and a lower cost of living. The main difference between the two territories is the cost of living, with Norfolk Island being more expensive due to its remote location and limited economy.\n\nThe cost of living in Norfolk Island is driven by the high cost of imports, limited job opportunities, and a small population. In contrast, New Caledonia has a more developed economy, with a larger population and a more diverse range of industries, which helps to keep costs lower. Overall, Norfolk Island is around 15-20% more expensive than New Caledonia, making it a more challenging destination for expats and travelers on a budget.
