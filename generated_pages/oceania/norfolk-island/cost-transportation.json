The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and private vehicles, with most people relying on their own cars or bicycles to get around. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with a network of buses that cover the main areas of the island, including the capital Kingston and the tourist areas. However, the frequency of buses can be limited, and the services may not run late at night or on weekends.\n\nThe island's small size and lack of traffic congestion make it an ideal place to explore by bike or on foot. Many tourists also choose to rent cars or scooters to get around, which can be a convenient and flexible way to explore the island. The roads on Norfolk Island are generally in good condition, and the scenic coastal routes offer stunning views of the ocean and surrounding landscape. With a population of just over 2,000 people, the island has a relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, making it easy to get around without the hassle of heavy traffic.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $60 | Good coverage of main areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly for tourists |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$15 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, fixed rate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.40 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus | N/A | Not available, island is small |\n| Domestic Flight | $200-$500 | From Norfolk Island Airport to mainland Australia or New Zealand |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider buying a monthly transit pass or renting a bike or scooter for the duration of your stay.\n- The **Norfolk Island Tourism** website provides information on transportation options, including bus schedules and car rental companies.\n- Be sure to negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before you start your journey, as they may not always use a meter.\n- If you plan to rent a car, book in advance to ensure availability, especially during peak season.\n- The island's scenic coastal roads can be narrow and winding, so be sure to drive carefully and follow local traffic rules.\n- Consider downloading the **Google Maps** app to help navigate the island's roads and find the best routes.",
