  "content": "As a territory of Australia, Norfolk Island's visa requirements are largely influenced by Australia's immigration policies, and citizens of certain countries may not need a visa to enter the island. \n\n[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Norfolk Island before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nNorfolk Island has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from over 40 countries eligible for visa-free entry or able to obtain a visa on arrival. The island's remote location and limited infrastructure mean that the government is selective about who can enter, but it also recognizes the importance of tourism to the local economy. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free arrangement with Australia will typically need to apply for a visa before traveling to Norfolk Island.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to promote tourism and economic development. As a result, citizens from countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom can enter Norfolk Island without a visa, while citizens from other countries may need to apply for a visa in advance. The visa application process typically involves submitting an application form, providing supporting documentation, and paying a fee.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) | 90 days | Must meet ETA requirements |\n| UK Citizens | No | Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) | 90 days | Must meet ETA requirements |\n| EU Citizens | No | Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) | 90 days | Must meet ETA requirements |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) | 90 days | Must meet ETA requirements |\n| Australian Citizens | No | None required | Unlimited | As citizens of the parent country |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Paper-based visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Paper-based visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay on Norfolk Island for up to 90 days, and may need to provide proof of onward travel and sufficient funds.
