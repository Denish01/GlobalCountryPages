# The Truth About Norfolk Island - History & Real Facts

Most people get wrong the fact that Norfolk Island is a self-governing territory with a unique history and culture, often misunderstanding its relationship with Australia and its geographical characteristics.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Norfolk Island was first inhabited by Polynesians around the 13th century, but the first European to sight the island was British explorer James Cook in 1774. The British established a penal colony on the island in 1788, which operated until 1814. The island was then abandoned until 1825, when a second penal colony was established, which lasted until 1855. In 1856, the island was settled by 194 Pitcairn Islanders, descendants of the **Bounty** mutineers, who brought with them their own language, **Norfuk**, and cultural practices. Norfolk Island was a self-governing territory from 1979 to 2016, when it was integrated into the Australian state of New South Wales.

The island's history is complex, with multiple periods of settlement and abandonment, and its cultural identity has been shaped by its Polynesian, British, and Pitcairn Islander heritage.
