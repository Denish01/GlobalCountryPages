Norfolk Island is a small territory with a limited range of transportation options. The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and private vehicles, with most people relying on their own cars or bicycles to get around. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with a network of buses that cover the main areas of the island, including the capital Kingston and the tourist areas. However, the frequency of buses can be limited, and the services may not run late at night or on weekends.

The island's small size and lack of traffic congestion make it an ideal place to explore by bike or on foot. Many tourists also choose to rent cars or scooters to get around, which can be a convenient and flexible way to explore the island. The roads on Norfolk Island are generally in good condition, and the scenic coastal routes offer stunning views of the ocean and surrounding landscape. With a population of just over 2,000 people, the island has a relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, making it easy to get around without the hassle of heavy traffic.
