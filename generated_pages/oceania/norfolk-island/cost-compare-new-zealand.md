[SECTION] Overview: Norfolk Island vs New Zealand [/SECTION]
Norfolk Island and New Zealand are both located in the Oceania region, but they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Norfolk Island is a territory of Australia, with a small population and a relatively high cost of living due to its remote location and limited resources. New Zealand, on the other hand, is a sovereign nation with a larger population and a more diverse economy. As a result, New Zealand tends to have lower prices for many goods and services, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees. The overall cost of living in Norfolk Island is around 15-20% higher than in New Zealand, with significant differences in housing, food, and transportation costs.

The economic context of Norfolk Island is characterized by a small, isolated economy with limited job opportunities and a high reliance on tourism and government services. This has led to a relatively high cost of living, with prices for housing, food, and other essentials being higher than in New Zealand. In contrast, New Zealand has a more diverse economy with a strong focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and services, which has helped to keep prices lower. Additionally, New Zealand's larger population and more competitive market have driven down prices for many goods and services, making it a more attractive option for those looking for a high quality of life at an affordable price.
