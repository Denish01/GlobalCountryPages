[SECTION] How Expensive Is Norfolk Island? [/SECTION]
Norfolk Island is a small territory in the Pacific Ocean, with a population of approximately 2,200 people. The island has a unique culture and history, and its remote location makes it an attractive destination for tourists looking for a peaceful and secluded getaway. However, this remoteness also contributes to the island's moderate to high cost of living, as many goods and services need to be imported from Australia or other countries. Compared to its neighbors, such as New Zealand and New Caledonia, Norfolk Island is generally more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food.

The cost of living in Norfolk Island is also influenced by its limited economy, which is primarily driven by tourism and government services. The island has a small workforce and a limited range of industries, which can make it difficult for people to find employment and afford the high cost of living. Despite these challenges, many people are drawn to Norfolk Island's unique culture and lifestyle, and the island remains a popular destination for tourists and expatriates.
