[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The political system of Norfolk Island is based on the principles of **representative democracy**, with the island's residents electing representatives to the Norfolk Island Regional Council. However, the island's legislative powers are limited, and the Australian government has the authority to make laws for the island. The **separation of powers** is not clearly defined, as the Administrator of Norfolk Island serves as both the head of government and the representative of the Australian government. The system is **unitary**, with the Australian government having the ultimate authority over the island's governance.

The governance structure of Norfolk Island has undergone significant changes in recent years. Prior to 2016, the island was self-governing, with its own legislative assembly and a high degree of autonomy. However, due to financial difficulties and concerns about the island's sustainability, the Australian government decided to integrate Norfolk Island into its federal system, abolishing the island's self-government and establishing the Norfolk Island Regional Council.

The **rule of law** is an essential aspect of Norfolk Island's political system, with the island's laws based on the common law tradition. The Australian government has the authority to make laws for the island, and the island's residents have access to the Australian court system.
