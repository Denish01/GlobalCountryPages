[SECTION] How Norfolk Island Is Divided [/SECTION]
Norfolk Island has a relatively simple administrative structure, with no official states, provinces, or regions. The island is governed as a single local government area, with the capital Kingston serving as the administrative center. This lack of divisions is due to the island's small size and population, making a more complex system unnecessary. The local government is responsible for providing services such as waste management, road maintenance, and community facilities.

The island's geography also plays a role in its administrative structure, with the rugged coastline and limited land area making it difficult to divide the island into separate regions. Instead, the island is often referred to as a single entity, with different areas and suburbs within the Kingston area. This simplicity makes it easy for visitors and residents to navigate the island and access its various amenities and attractions.
