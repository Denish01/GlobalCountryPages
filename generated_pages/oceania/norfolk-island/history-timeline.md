# Norfolk Island History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Norfolk Island is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans over 1,000 years, from the initial settlement by Polynesian seafarers to its current status as an Australian territory.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Norfolk Island begins with the arrival of **Polynesian seafarers** around the 14th century, who settled on the island and established a thriving community. However, by the time European explorers arrived in the late 18th century, the island was uninhabited, and it is believed that the Polynesian settlers may have been wiped out by disease or conflict. In 1774, British explorer **James Cook** discovered the island and named it Norfolk Island, after the Duchess of Norfolk. The British established a penal colony on the island in 1788, which operated until 1814. The island was then abandoned, but in 1825, a second penal colony was established, which lasted until 1855. After the closure of the penal colony, the island was settled by **Pitcairn Islanders**, who were descendants of the mutineers from the HMS Bounty and their Polynesian companions.

The Pitcairn Islanders brought with them their unique culture and language, which has had a lasting impact on the island's identity. In 1914, Norfolk Island was officially declared a territory of Australia, and it has remained under Australian administration ever since. During World War II, the island played an important role as a military base, and it was also used as a location for the **Allies'** military strategy in the Pacific. Today, Norfolk Island is a popular tourist destination, known for its stunning natural beauty, rich history, and unique culture.

From the British penal colonies to the Pitcairn Islanders' settlement, each period has left its mark on the island's culture, language, and identity.
