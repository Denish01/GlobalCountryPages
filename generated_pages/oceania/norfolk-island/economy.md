[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Norfolk Island has a small, high-income economy that is heavily reliant on external support. The island's economy is classified as a high-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $27,000. However, the economy is also highly vulnerable to external shocks, given its small size and limited economic diversification. The island's development level is relatively high, with modern infrastructure and a high standard of living. Despite this, the economy faces significant challenges, including a limited labor market, high transportation costs, and a lack of economic diversification.

The island's economic trajectory has been shaped by its history as a penal colony and its subsequent development as a tourist destination. Today, tourism is the main driver of the economy, with visitors attracted to the island's natural beauty, historic sites, and unique culture. The government also plays a significant role in the economy, providing services and employment opportunities to the island's residents. However, the economy is also subject to fluctuations in the global economy, and the island's remote location makes it vulnerable to disruptions in trade and transportation.

Norfolk Island's economy is also closely tied to that of Australia, which provides significant financial support to the island. The Australian government has responsibility for the island's defense, foreign affairs, and some domestic policies, and also provides funding for various services and infrastructure projects. This relationship has helped to support the island's economy, but it also limits the island's autonomy and ability to pursue its own economic development strategies.
