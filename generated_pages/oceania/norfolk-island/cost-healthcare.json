Public healthcare is generally more affordable, but the services are limited, and locals often have to travel to Australia for more specialized care.

The public healthcare system is funded by the Australian government, and locals are entitled to free or low-cost medical care, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, the public system has limited resources and specialized services, and patients may experience long waiting times.\n\nFor foreigners, private healthcare is often the better option, with more comprehensive services and shorter waiting times. However, private healthcare can be expensive, and the costs are usually out-of-pocket.
