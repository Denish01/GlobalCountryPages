The quality of care is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the island's small size and remote location can make it difficult to access specialized care, and patients may need to be evacuated to Australia or New Zealand for more complex treatments. Urban and rural access to healthcare is relatively equal, with the main hospital and several clinics located in the capital, Kingston.\n\nThe public healthcare system is funded by the Australian government, and residents are entitled to free or low-cost medical care. However, private health insurance is still recommended, especially for those who want to access private healthcare services or be evacuated to Australia or New Zealand for treatment. The island's healthcare system is also supported by a network of community health services, including home care, dental care, and mental health services.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by its remote location, Norfolk Island's healthcare system is well-organized and provides a good level of care to its residents. However, visitors and expats should still take out private health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Norfolk Island Hospital | Kingston | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Kingston Medical Centre | Kingston | Private | General practice, family medicine | Yes |\n| Bounty Clinic | Burnt Pine | Private | General practice, family medicine | Yes |\n| Norfolk Island Dental Clinic | Kingston | Private | Dentistry, oral surgery | Yes |\n| Community Health Centre | Kingston | Public | Community health, home care | Yes |\n| Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Medical Centre | Kingston | Military | Military medicine, emergency care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Private health insurance is recommended for visitors and expats, as it can help cover any unexpected medical expenses.\n- The Australian government's Medicare program does not cover Norfolk Island residents, so they need to take out private health insurance.\n- Local insurance options are available, but they may not provide the same level of coverage as Australian or international insurance policies.\n- Expats and visitors should check if their insurance policy covers them in Norfolk Island, as some policies may not cover medical care in remote or overseas locations.\n- The cost of private health insurance in Norfolk Island can be high, due to the island's remote location and limited healthcare options.\n- Some insurance policies may require policyholders to be evacuated to Australia or New Zealand for treatment, which can add to the cost.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are available at the island's pharmacies, but the range of medications may be limited due to the island's remote location.\n- Prescription requirements are the same as in Australia, and visitors and expats should bring their prescriptions with them.\n- Common brands of medications are available, but generic alternatives may be more widely available.\n- The cost of medications can be high, due to the island's remote location and limited competition.\n- Pharmacies are located in Kingston and Burnt Pine, and they are generally well-stocked with common medications.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- Visitors to Norfolk Island should be up-to-date on all routine vaccinations, including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis.\n- The risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV is low, but visitors should still take precautions.\n- The island is free of endemic diseases such as malaria and yellow fever.\n- Water safety is generally good, but visitors should still take precautions when swimming in the ocean or eating seafood.\n- Food safety is also generally good, but visitors should still take precautions when eating at restaurants or food stalls.\n- **Insect-borne illnesses** such as dengue fever and Zika virus are not present on the island, but visitors should still take precautions against insect bites.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Norfolk Island is not a major medical tourism destination, due to its remote location and limited healthcare options.\n- However, some visitors may come to the island for **dental tourism**, as the cost of dental care can be lower than in Australia or New Zealand.\n- The island's hospitals and clinics are accredited to Australian standards, which can provide assurance for visitors seeking medical care.\n- The cost savings of medical tourism in Norfolk Island can be significant, but visitors should still do their research and check if their insurance policy covers them in the island.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In an emergency, visitors should call 000, which is the Australian emergency number.\n- Ambulance services are available, but they may be limited due to the island's remote location.\n- The nearest hospital is the Norfolk Island Hospital, which is located in Kingston.\n- Visitors should have a plan in place in case of an emergency, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of communication.\n- Insurance claims can be complex, so visitors should check their policy and contact their insurer as soon as possible after an emergency.",
