[/SECTION]\nNorfolk Island is a small territory in the Pacific Ocean, with a population of approximately 2,200 people. The island has a unique culture and history, and its remote location makes it an attractive destination for tourists looking for a peaceful and secluded getaway.

The island has a small workforce and a limited range of industries, which can make it difficult for people to find employment and afford the high cost of living.
