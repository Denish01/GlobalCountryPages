[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Norfolk Island's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the Norfolk Island Health and Residential Aged Care Service being the main public healthcare provider. The quality of care is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the island's small size and remote location can make it difficult to access specialized care, and patients may need to be evacuated to Australia or New Zealand for more complex treatments. Urban and rural access to healthcare is relatively equal, with the main hospital and several clinics located in the capital, Kingston.

The public healthcare system is funded by the Australian government, and residents are entitled to free or low-cost medical care. However, private health insurance is still recommended, especially for those who want to access private healthcare services or be evacuated to Australia or New Zealand for treatment. The island's healthcare system is also supported by a network of community health services, including home care, dental care, and mental health services.

Despite the challenges posed by its remote location, Norfolk Island's healthcare system is well-organized and provides a good level of care to its residents. However, visitors and expats should still take out private health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses.
