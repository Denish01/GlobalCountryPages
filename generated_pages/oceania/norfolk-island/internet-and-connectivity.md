[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet quality in Norfolk Island is generally good, with most residents and visitors able to access reliable internet services. However, there is a noticeable urban vs rural divide, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in the capital Kingston and other populated areas, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The island's remote location and limited infrastructure also mean that internet services can be affected by weather conditions and other external factors, making reliability a concern. Overall, while the internet in Norfolk Island is not the fastest or most reliable, it is sufficient for basic needs such as browsing, email, and social media.

Despite the limitations, the Norfolk Island government and service providers have made efforts to improve internet infrastructure and services in recent years. This includes the installation of new undersea cables and the expansion of mobile network coverage to more areas of the island. As a result, visitors and residents can now access a range of internet services, including broadband, mobile broadband, and WiFi, although speeds and availability can still vary depending on the location and provider.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Norfolk Island, visitors can purchase one from the main carriers, Norfolk Telecom or Telstra, at their retail outlets or authorized resellers. To buy a SIM card, visitors will typically need to provide a passport and proof of address, and may also need to register their SIM card with the provider. Recommended carriers include Norfolk Telecom, which offers a range of prepaid and postpaid plans, and Telstra, which provides mobile broadband services with good coverage and speeds. Data plans are available from both carriers, with prices starting from around 10 USD per month for a basic plan.

For tourists, a prepaid SIM card is a convenient and affordable option, with prices starting from around 20 USD for a SIM card with a set amount of data and credit. Visitors can also purchase a SIM card with a data-only plan, which can be a good option for those who only need internet access for a short period. It's worth noting that SIM cards can be purchased at the airport, as well as at retail outlets and authorized resellers in Kingston and other populated areas.
