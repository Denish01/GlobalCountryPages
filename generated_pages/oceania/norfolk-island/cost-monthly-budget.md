Norfolk Island has a relatively high cost of living, driven by its remote location and limited economy. The GDP per capita (PPP) of $43,533 is one of the highest in the region, indicating a strong economy and high standard of living.

The cost of living in Norfolk Island is comparable to other remote islands in the Pacific, such as New Caledonia and the Cook Islands.

The high cost of living is driven by the island's limited economy and lack of competition, which can make it difficult for residents to find affordable options for goods and services. Despite this, Norfolk Island offers a unique and beautiful environment that can make it an attractive destination for tourists and expats.
