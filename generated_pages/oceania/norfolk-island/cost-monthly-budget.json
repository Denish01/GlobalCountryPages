The GDP per capita (PPP) of $43,533 is one of the highest in the region, indicating a strong economy and high standard of living. However, this also means that prices for goods and services are relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

A budget of $4,500 per month can provide a high standard of living, with plenty of opportunities for entertainment, travel, and luxury.\n\nThe cost of living in Norfolk Island is comparable to other remote islands in the Pacific, such as New Caledonia and the Cook Islands.

Despite this, Norfolk Island offers a unique and beautiful environment that can make it an attractive destination for tourists and expats.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 800 | 1,200 | 1,800 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 500 | 800 | 1,200 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 100 | 200 | 300 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 150 | 250 | 350 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 100 | 200 | 300 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 200 | 400 | 600 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 100 | 200 | 300 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 500 | 800 | 1,000 | |\n| **Total** | **2,450** | **3,550** | **4,550** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget of $2,500 per month can provide a basic standard of living in Norfolk Island.
