  "content": "Norfolk Island's economy is driven by a combination of tourism, fishing, and government services, with a strong reliance on its parent country, Australia, for financial support and trade.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($60 million estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($27,000 estimate)\nIncome Classification: High\nMain Industries: Tourism, Fishing, Government Services\nCurrency: AUD\nUnemployment Rate: 10% approximate\nEase of Doing Business: relatively high ranking\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nNorfolk Island has a small, high-income economy that is heavily reliant on external support. The island's economy is classified as a high-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $27,000. However, the economy is also highly vulnerable to external shocks, given its small size and limited economic diversification. The island's development level is relatively high, with modern infrastructure and a high standard of living. Despite this, the economy faces significant challenges, including a limited labor market, high transportation costs, and a lack of economic diversification.\n\nThe island's economic trajectory has been shaped by its history as a penal colony and its subsequent development as a tourist destination. Today, tourism is the main driver of the economy, with visitors attracted to the island's natural beauty, historic sites, and unique culture. The government also plays a significant role in the economy, providing services and employment opportunities to the island's residents. However, the economy is also subject to fluctuations in the global economy, and the island's remote location makes it vulnerable to disruptions in trade and transportation.\n\nNorfolk Island's economy is also closely tied to that of Australia, which provides significant financial support to the island. The Australian government has responsibility for the island's defense, foreign affairs, and some domestic policies, and also provides funding for various services and infrastructure projects. This relationship has helped to support the island's economy, but it also limits the island's autonomy and ability to pursue its own economic development strategies.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tourism | 30% | The tourism industry is the main driver of the economy, with visitors attracted to the island's natural beauty, historic sites, and unique culture |\n| Fishing | 20% | The fishing industry is also significant, with the island's waters providing a rich source of seafood |\n| Government Services | 20% | The government provides a range of services, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure maintenance |\n| Agriculture | 10% | The island has a small agricultural sector, with crops including potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkins |\n| Manufacturing | 5% | The manufacturing sector is small, with a focus on food processing and crafts |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Seafood**, including fish, lobsters, and other crustaceans\n- **Tourism services**, including accommodation, food, and activities\n- **Crafts**, including woodcarvings, textiles, and other local products\n- **Agricultural products**, including potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkins\n- **Postage stamps**, which are a significant source of revenue for the island\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food and beverages**, including meat, dairy products, and other staples\n- **Fuel**, including petrol, diesel, and other energy sources\n- **Machinery and equipment**, including vehicles, generators, and other machinery\n- **Building materials**, including timber, cement, and other construction supplies\n- **Electronics**, including computers, phones, and other electronic devices\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Australia, which provides significant financial support and is the island's main trading partner\n- New Zealand, which is also an important trading partner and source of goods and services\n- Other Pacific Island nations, with which the island has cultural and economic ties\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The island has a well-developed transportation network, including a airport and a seaport\n- The energy sector is dominated by diesel generators, with some renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power\n- Internet and mobile phone penetration is high, with most residents having access to these services\n- The island has a range of community facilities, including schools, hospitals, and sports facilities\n- The government is investing in infrastructure development, including upgrades to the airport and seaport, and the development of new community facilities\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe economic outlook for Norfolk Island is generally positive, with the tourism industry expected to continue to drive growth.
