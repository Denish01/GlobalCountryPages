# Norfolk Island Visa & Entry Requirements

As a territory of Australia, Norfolk Island's visa requirements are largely influenced by Australia's immigration policies, and citizens of certain countries may not need a visa to enter the island.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Norfolk Island has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from over 40 countries eligible for visa-free entry or able to obtain a visa on arrival. The island's remote location and limited infrastructure mean that the government is selective about who can enter, but it also recognizes the importance of tourism to the local economy. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free arrangement with Australia will typically need to apply for a visa before traveling to Norfolk Island.

The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to promote tourism and economic development. As a result, citizens from countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom can enter Norfolk Island without a visa, while citizens from other countries may need to apply for a visa in advance. The visa application process typically involves submitting an application form, providing supporting documentation, and paying a fee.
