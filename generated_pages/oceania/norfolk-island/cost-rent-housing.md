[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Norfolk Island is relatively small and competitive, with a limited supply of properties available for rent. Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, and tenants are usually required to pay a security deposit equivalent to one month's rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Residential Tenancies Act**, which sets out the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as New Zealand and New Caledonia, Norfolk Island's housing costs are relatively high due to its remote location and limited supply of properties. However, the island's unique culture and stunning natural beauty make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists.

The housing market in Norfolk Island is also influenced by the island's small population and limited economic opportunities. As a result, the rental market is largely driven by demand from expats and tourists, rather than locals. This can make it challenging for renters to find affordable and suitable accommodation, particularly during peak season. However, with careful planning and research, it is possible to find a comfortable and affordable place to live on the island.
