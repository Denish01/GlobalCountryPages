[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Norfolk Island is relatively small and quiet, with a limited number of properties available for sale or rent. The market is driven by the island's small population and the tourism industry, which is the mainstay of the local economy. Prices have been relatively stable in recent years, with a slight increase in demand for properties in the capital, Kingston. The urban areas, such as Kingston and Burnt Pine, tend to have higher property prices compared to the rural areas, which are more laid back and offer a more relaxed lifestyle. The market is also influenced by the island's unique **Norfuk** culture and the **Australian** government's policies, which aim to preserve the island's environment and heritage.

The current market conditions are characterized by a shortage of properties for sale, which has led to an increase in prices. However, the rental market is relatively stable, with a steady demand for properties from tourists and locals alike. The price trajectory is expected to continue to rise, driven by the island's growing popularity as a tourist destination and the limited supply of properties. The urban areas are expected to experience more growth, driven by the development of new infrastructure and amenities.

The rural areas, on the other hand, offer a more peaceful and serene lifestyle, with plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities such as fishing, hiking, and **birdwatching**. The rural areas are also home to many of the island's historic sites and **cultural landmarks**, which are an important part of the island's heritage. The rural areas are generally more affordable than the urban areas, with lower property prices and a more relaxed pace of life.
