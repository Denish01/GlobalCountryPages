  "content": "The internet in Norfolk Island is relatively reliable, with average speeds suitable for basic browsing and communication, but with some limitations in terms of mobile network coverage and WiFi availability. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 10 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Good\nMain Carriers: Norfolk Telecom, Telstra\nSIM Card Cost: 20 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet quality in Norfolk Island is generally good, with most residents and visitors able to access reliable internet services. However, there is a noticeable urban vs rural divide, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in the capital Kingston and other populated areas, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The island's remote location and limited infrastructure also mean that internet services can be affected by weather conditions and other external factors, making reliability a concern. Overall, while the internet in Norfolk Island is not the fastest or most reliable, it is sufficient for basic needs such as browsing, email, and social media.\n\nDespite the limitations, the Norfolk Island government and service providers have made efforts to improve internet infrastructure and services in recent years. This includes the installation of new undersea cables and the expansion of mobile network coverage to more areas of the island. As a result, visitors and residents can now access a range of internet services, including broadband, mobile broadband, and WiFi, although speeds and availability can still vary depending on the location and provider.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Norfolk Island, visitors can purchase one from the main carriers, Norfolk Telecom or Telstra, at their retail outlets or authorized resellers. To buy a SIM card, visitors will typically need to provide a passport and proof of address, and may also need to register their SIM card with the provider. Recommended carriers include Norfolk Telecom, which offers a range of prepaid and postpaid plans, and Telstra, which provides mobile broadband services with good coverage and speeds. Data plans are available from both carriers, with prices starting from around 10 USD per month for a basic plan.\n\nFor tourists, a prepaid SIM card is a convenient and affordable option, with prices starting from around 20 USD for a SIM card with a set amount of data and credit. Visitors can also purchase a SIM card with a data-only plan, which can be a good option for those who only need internet access for a short period. It's worth noting that SIM cards can be purchased at the airport, as well as at retail outlets and authorized resellers in Kingston and other populated areas.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Norfolk Telecom | Prepaid | 1GB | 10 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Telstra | Prepaid | 5GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Norfolk Telecom | Postpaid | 10GB | 30 | Monthly plan with 12-month contract |\n| Telstra | Postpaid | 20GB | 40 | Monthly plan with 12-month contract |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels and resorts offering free WiFi to guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is limited, with only a few cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are not available, but some hotels and resorts offer business centers or meeting rooms with internet access\n- Public WiFi is limited, with only a few hotspots available in Kingston and other populated areas\n- Some tourist attractions and visitor centers also offer free WiFi to visitors\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are not available, but some hotels and resorts offer business centers or meeting rooms with internet access\n- Reliable cafe chains are limited, but some cafes and restaurants offer free WiFi to customers\n- Backup internet options include mobile broadband services from Norfolk Telecom or Telstra\n- VPN needs are minimal, as internet censorship is not a major concern in Norfolk Island\n- Some hotels and resorts also offer **remote work** packages and facilities, including meeting rooms and business centers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major concern in Norfolk Island, but some websites may be blocked due to **geoblocking** restrictions\n- Blocked sites include some online services and content providers that are not available in Australia or the Pacific region\n- VPN recommendations include using a reputable VPN provider to access blocked websites and secure internet connections\n- Roaming alternatives include purchasing a local SIM card or using a mobile broadband service from a provider such as Norfolk Telecom or Telstra\n- eSIM options are not widely available, but some providers offer eSIM plans for compatible devices\n- Visitors should also be aware of **data limits** and **roaming charges** when using their mobile device in Norfolk Island, and take steps to manage their data usage and avoid unexpected charges.",
