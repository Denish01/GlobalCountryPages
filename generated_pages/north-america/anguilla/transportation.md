[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main airport in Anguilla is the Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport, which is located near the island's capital, The Valley. The airport receives direct flights from several regional hubs, including San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Maarten, as well as connecting flights from major airports in the United States and Europe. If you're coming from a nearby island, you can also take a ferry or a chartered flight to reach Anguilla. The island's proximity to St. Maarten makes it a popular day-trip destination, and many tourists visit Anguilla by taking a ferry from Marigot or Philipsburg.

There are no overland entry points to Anguilla, as it is an island territory surrounded by the Caribbean Sea. The only way to reach the island is by air or sea, and the airport and seaport are the main entry points for visitors. The airport is small and efficient, with a single terminal that handles all arrivals and departures. The seaport, on the other hand, is a bustling hub of activity, with ferries and charter boats coming and going throughout the day. Whether you arrive by air or sea, you'll be greeted by the warm sunshine and crystal-clear waters that make Anguilla a popular destination for travelers.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
There are no domestic flights within Anguilla, as the island is small enough to be easily explored by car or taxi. However, if you're planning to visit other islands in the region, you can take a charter flight or a ferry to reach your destination. Several airlines, including Anguilla Air Services and Trans Anguilla Airways, offer charter flights to nearby islands, including St. Maarten, St. Barths, and the British Virgin Islands. Booking a charter flight can be expensive, but it's a convenient way to reach your destination quickly and easily. Approximate costs for charter flights range from $200 to $500 per person, depending on the destination and the time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in Anguilla, as the island is small and has a limited population. The lack of a rail network is not a significant concern, however, as the island is easy to navigate by car or taxi, and the scenery is so beautiful that you'll want to take your time and enjoy the views. If you're looking for a unique way to see the island, you can take a horse-drawn carriage tour or a bike tour, which will give you a chance to experience the island's natural beauty at a leisurely pace.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There is no public bus system in Anguilla, but several private companies offer bus and coach services to visitors. These services are typically used for airport transfers and sightseeing tours, and they can be booked in advance through your hotel or a local tour operator. The buses and coaches are air-conditioned and comfortable, and they offer a convenient way to get around the island without having to rent a car. Costs vary depending on the destination and the type of service, but you can expect to pay around $10 to $20 per person for a one-way transfer.
