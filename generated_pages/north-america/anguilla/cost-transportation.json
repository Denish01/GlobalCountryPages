The main modes of transportation are taxis, rental cars, and bicycles, as the island lacks a comprehensive public transportation system. Most people get around the island by driving or taking taxis, as the roads are generally in good condition and the distances are relatively short. The quality of public transit is limited, with no bus system or metro, making it necessary for visitors to rely on other modes of transportation.\n\nThe island's small size and lack of traffic congestion make it easy to get around, and many visitors choose to rent cars or scooters to explore the island at their own pace. However, it's worth noting that driving is on the left-hand side of the road, and visitors from countries that drive on the right-hand side may need to adjust to this. Additionally, some roads on the island can be narrow and winding, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | N/A | N/A | No city bus system available |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | No metro or subway system available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used by locals |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | No commuter train available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2-$3 | $10-$20 | Widely available, but no ride-hailing apps |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | No ride-hailing services available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | Private transfers or taxis available from the airport |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Fuel prices can vary depending on the location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | Limited availability of diesel fuel on the island |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car rentals available, including taxes and insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options available in The Valley |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | No toll roads on the island |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus | N/A | No intercity bus services available |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Flights from Anguilla to neighboring islands, such as Saint Martin or the British Virgin Islands |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | No train services available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider renting a car or scooter for the duration of your stay, as this can be more cost-effective than taking taxis.\n- Be sure to negotiate the price of your taxi fare before you start your journey, as some taxi drivers may not use meters.\n- Use reputable taxi services, such as those licensed by the government, to ensure your safety.\n- Be aware of the island's speed limits and road signs, as driving can be hazardous, especially at night.\n- Consider using a GPS or map to navigate the island, as some roads can be narrow and winding.\n- If you plan to rent a car, be sure to check the insurance options and requirements, as some rental companies may not include insurance in the rental price.",
