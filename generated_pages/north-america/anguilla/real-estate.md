[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Anguilla is characterized by a mix of high-end luxury developments and more affordable local housing. The market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by demand from tourists and expatriates, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per annum. The urban areas, such as The Valley and Sandy Ground, tend to be more expensive than the rural areas, where land and property prices are lower. However, the rural areas often offer more spacious plots and a more relaxed lifestyle.

The trend towards luxury development is evident in the construction of high-end villas and resorts, particularly in areas like West End and Rendezvous Bay. These developments cater to the growing demand for upscale vacation rentals and offer amenities such as private pools, beaches, and golf courses. In contrast, the local housing market is more affordable, with prices starting from around $200,000 for a two-bedroom apartment.

The government of Anguilla has implemented various initiatives to promote the property market, including the introduction of a **tax holiday** for new developments and the streamlining of the ** Alien Land Holding License** process. These measures have helped to attract foreign investment and stimulate growth in the sector.
