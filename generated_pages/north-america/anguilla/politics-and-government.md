[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Anguilla operates under a constitutional monarchy, with the British monarch serving as the head of state, represented by a governor appointed by the monarch. The head of government is the Chief Minister, who is responsible for advising the governor and overseeing the administration of the island. The House of Assembly is the unicameral legislature, consisting of 11 members, with 7 elected by the people and 4 appointed by the governor. This system provides a framework for the separation of powers, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. Anguilla's political system is unitary, with the central government responsible for making decisions on behalf of the island.

The separation of powers in Anguilla's government is designed to provide checks and balances, preventing any one branch from dominating the others. The executive branch, led by the Chief Minister, is responsible for implementing policies and administering the island's affairs. The legislative branch, comprised of the House of Assembly, has the power to make laws and approve the government's budget. The judicial branch, consisting of the Magistrate's Court and the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the constitution.

Anguilla's political system is also characterized by a high degree of autonomy, with the island having significant control over its internal affairs. However, the British government retains responsibility for defense and foreign affairs, as well as certain aspects of internal security. This arrangement allows Anguilla to maintain a significant degree of self-governance while still benefiting from its relationship with the United Kingdom.
