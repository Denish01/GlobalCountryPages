The territory is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and it shares a maritime border with the British Virgin Islands to the northwest and the French-Dutch island of Saint Martin to the south. The island is relatively flat and low-lying, with its highest point being Crocus Hill, which stands at a modest 65 meters above sea level.\n\nThe location of Anguilla in the Caribbean Sea makes it prone to hurricanes and tropical storms, which can have a significant impact on the island's economy and infrastructure. The territory's proximity to other islands in the region also makes it an attractive destination for tourists and travelers, who come to enjoy the island's beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant culture. The capital, The Valley, is located in the center of the island and serves as the administrative and commercial hub of the territory.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe terrain of Anguilla is generally flat and low-lying, with a few small hills and valleys scattered throughout the island. The landscape is dominated by **beaches**, which are renowned for their white sand and crystal-clear waters. The island's coastline is characterized by a series of **bays** and **coves**, which provide a habitat for a diverse range of marine life, including sea turtles, stingrays, and colorful fish.
