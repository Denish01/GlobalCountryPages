[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Anguilla's healthcare system is a mix of public and private services, with the public system being generally more affordable but with limited resources and long wait times. The public healthcare system is available to all residents, including foreigners with a valid residence permit, and is funded through a combination of government subsidies and patient fees. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers higher quality care and shorter wait times, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to cover medical expenses, as public healthcare services may not be readily available or may not provide the level of care expected.

The healthcare system in Anguilla is relatively well-developed, with a number of public and private healthcare facilities, including the Princess Alexandra Hospital, which is the main public hospital on the island. However, for more complex medical procedures, patients may need to be transferred to a hospital in another country, such as the United States or the United Kingdom. In general, it is recommended that foreigners and locals alike have some form of health insurance to cover medical expenses, as healthcare costs can be high and unpredictable.
