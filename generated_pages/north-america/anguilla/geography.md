[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Anguilla is a British overseas territory in the Caribbean, positioned in the northern part of the Lesser Antilles, an arc of islands that stretches from the Greater Antilles to the coast of South America. The territory is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and it shares a maritime border with the British Virgin Islands to the northwest and the French-Dutch island of Saint Martin to the south. The island is relatively flat and low-lying, with its highest point being Crocus Hill, which stands at a modest 65 meters above sea level.

The location of Anguilla in the Caribbean Sea makes it prone to hurricanes and tropical storms, which can have a significant impact on the island's economy and infrastructure. The territory's proximity to other islands in the region also makes it an attractive destination for tourists and travelers, who come to enjoy the island's beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant culture. The capital, The Valley, is located in the center of the island and serves as the administrative and commercial hub of the territory.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Anguilla is generally flat and low-lying, with a few small hills and valleys scattered throughout the island. The landscape is dominated by **beaches**, which are renowned for their white sand and crystal-clear waters. The island's coastline is characterized by a series of **bays** and **coves**, which provide a habitat for a diverse range of marine life, including sea turtles, stingrays, and colorful fish. The interior of the island is covered in **scrubland** and **woodland**, which are home to a variety of bird species, including the Anguillian subspecies of the **brown pelican**.

The island's **geology** is composed primarily of **limestone**, which has been eroded over time to form a series of **caves** and **rock formations**. The limestone terrain also gives rise to a number of **salt ponds**, which are shallow pools of water that are separated from the sea by a barrier of sand or rock. These ponds are an important habitat for a variety of wildlife, including **birds**, **fish**, and **invertebrates**. The island's **hydrology** is characterized by a lack of permanent **rivers**, with most of the freshwater coming from **rainfall** and **groundwater**.

The landscape of Anguilla has been shaped by a combination of natural and human factors, including **erosion**, **deposition**, and **land use**. The island's **coastal erosion** is a significant concern, as it can lead to the loss of **beaches** and **habitats**. The territory's **agriculture** is also an important part of the landscape, with crops such as **sugar cane**, **corn**, and **peas** being grown on a small scale.
