[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Anguilla is relatively small and competitive, with a high demand for apartments and houses, particularly in the city center. Typical lease terms are one to two years, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Anguilla Rent Restriction Act, which regulates rent increases and provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as Saint Martin and the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla's housing costs are relatively high, due in part to its limited land area and high demand from tourists and expatriates.

The housing market in Anguilla is also influenced by the island's **tourist season**, which can drive up prices for short-term rentals and vacation homes. However, for long-term renters, there are opportunities to find more affordable options outside of the city center. It's worth noting that Anguilla has a relatively low **property tax** rate, which can make it an attractive option for property owners. Additionally, the island's **infrastructure** is well-developed, with modern amenities and services available in most areas.
