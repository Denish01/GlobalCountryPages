[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The cost of food in Anguilla is significantly higher than the regional average, mainly due to the island's small size and lack of local production, resulting in a high reliance on imported goods. The prices of food are driven up by transportation costs, import duties, and the limited competition in the market. Eating out is a popular activity in Anguilla, with many restaurants offering a range of cuisine, from seafood to international dishes. However, due to the high prices, many locals and visitors prefer to cook at home, where they can buy ingredients at supermarkets or local markets.

The eating-out culture in Anguilla is vibrant, with many restaurants offering a unique dining experience, often with a focus on fresh seafood and local ingredients. However, the prices can be steep, with a meal for two at a mid-range restaurant costing around $60-$80 USD. In contrast, cooking at home can be a more affordable option, with a monthly grocery budget for one person ranging from $800-$1,200 USD. The local currency, the Eastern Caribbean Dollar (XCD), is pegged to the US dollar, making it easy for visitors to understand and compare prices.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Anguilla can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to have a wider range of products, including imported goods, but the prices are often higher than at local markets. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and seafood at competitive prices, but the selection may be limited. It's recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported products.

The price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be substantial, with some items costing up to 50% more at supermarkets. However, the convenience and wide range of products at supermarkets may make them a better option for some shoppers. Bargaining is not a common practice in Anguilla, and prices are generally fixed. However, at local markets, vendors may be willing to negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases.
