Lloyd International Airport, which is located near the island's capital, The Valley. The airport receives direct flights from several regional hubs, including San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Maarten, as well as connecting flights from major airports in the United States and Europe. If you're coming from a nearby island, you can also take a ferry or a chartered flight to reach Anguilla. The island's proximity to St. Maarten makes it a popular day-trip destination, and many tourists visit Anguilla by taking a ferry from Marigot or Philipsburg.\n\nThere are no overland entry points to Anguilla, as it is an island territory surrounded by the Caribbean Sea. The only way to reach the island is by air or sea, and the airport and seaport are the main entry points for visitors. The airport is small and efficient, with a single terminal that handles all arrivals and departures. The seaport, on the other hand, is a bustling hub of activity, with ferries and charter boats coming and going throughout the day. Whether you arrive by air or sea, you'll be greeted by the warm sunshine and crystal-clear waters that make Anguilla a popular destination for travelers.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThere are no domestic flights within Anguilla, as the island is small enough to be easily explored by car or taxi.

Several airlines, including Anguilla Air Services and Trans Anguilla Airways, offer charter flights to nearby islands, including St. Maarten, St. Barths, and the British Virgin Islands. Booking a charter flight can be expensive, but it's a convenient way to reach your destination quickly and easily. Approximate costs for charter flights range from $200 to $500 per person, depending on the destination and the time of year.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in Anguilla, as the island is small and has a limited population.
