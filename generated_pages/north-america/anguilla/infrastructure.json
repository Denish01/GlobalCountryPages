  "content": "The infrastructure in Anguilla is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on tourism and a high standard of living, but still faces challenges in terms of limited resources and vulnerability to natural disasters.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 87%\nRoad Network: 63 km, paved and in good condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nAnguilla's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other Caribbean territories, with a strong emphasis on providing a high standard of living for its residents and visitors. The territory has invested heavily in recent years to upgrade its infrastructure, including the expansion of its airport and the development of new tourism facilities. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with the capital, The Valley, being the main hub of economic activity and infrastructure development. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this disparity, including the development of new residential areas and the improvement of roads and utilities in rural areas.\n\nThe territory's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to buildings, roads, and utilities. As a result, the government has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of such disasters, including the development of emergency response plans and the construction of storm-resistant buildings. Despite these challenges, Anguilla's infrastructure remains one of the most developed in the region, with a high standard of living and a strong focus on tourism and economic development.\n\nThe government of Anguilla has also implemented various initiatives to promote sustainable development and reduce the territory's reliance on fossil fuels. These initiatives include the development of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and the promotion of energy-efficient practices. As a result, Anguilla is well-positioned to continue its economic development while minimizing its impact on the environment.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 63 km | Good | Paved and well-maintained, with regular repairs and upgrades |\n| Railways | none | - | Anguilla has no railways, with all transportation being done by road or sea |\n| Airports | 1 international | Good | The Clayton J.
