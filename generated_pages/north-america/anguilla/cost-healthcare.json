  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Anguilla can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but with limited resources and long wait times, while private healthcare offers higher quality care but at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,144 (World Bank figure)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 34.6% (World Bank figure)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XCD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nAnguilla's healthcare system is a mix of public and private services, with the public system being generally more affordable but with limited resources and long wait times. The public healthcare system is available to all residents, including foreigners with a valid residence permit, and is funded through a combination of government subsidies and patient fees. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers higher quality care and shorter wait times, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to cover medical expenses, as public healthcare services may not be readily available or may not provide the level of care expected.\n\nThe healthcare system in Anguilla is relatively well-developed, with a number of public and private healthcare facilities, including the Princess Alexandra Hospital, which is the main public hospital on the island. However, for more complex medical procedures, patients may need to be transferred to a hospital in another country, such as the United States or the United Kingdom. In general, it is recommended that foreigners and locals alike have some form of health insurance to cover medical expenses, as healthcare costs can be high and unpredictable.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public healthcare may have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private healthcare offers shorter wait times and more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Private dental care may offer more advanced procedures and equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private eye care may offer more advanced diagnostic equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Private labs may offer faster turnaround times and more advanced testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public hospital may have long wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Private hospital may offer more comfortable accommodations and amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospital may offer more advanced surgical equipment and techniques |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | Private hospital may offer more personalized care and amenities |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Private hospital may offer more advanced imaging equipment |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Private hospital may offer faster turnaround times and more advanced diagnostic equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, advanced medical procedures, dental and eye care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global healthcare coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be purchased at public and private pharmacies, with costs varying depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and some grocery stores\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antihistamines can cost between $5-$20\n- Prescription rules are generally similar to those in the United States and the United Kingdom, with some medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good, with several pharmacies located in The Valley and other major towns\n- Some medications may be imported from other countries, which can affect availability and cost\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or visit the emergency room at the Princess Alexandra Hospital.
