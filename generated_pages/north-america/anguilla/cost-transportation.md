[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Anguilla is a small island territory with a relatively simple transportation system. The main modes of transportation are taxis, rental cars, and bicycles, as the island lacks a comprehensive public transportation system. Most people get around the island by driving or taking taxis, as the roads are generally in good condition and the distances are relatively short. The quality of public transit is limited, with no bus system or metro, making it necessary for visitors to rely on other modes of transportation.

The island's small size and lack of traffic congestion make it easy to get around, and many visitors choose to rent cars or scooters to explore the island at their own pace. However, it's worth noting that driving is on the left-hand side of the road, and visitors from countries that drive on the right-hand side may need to adjust to this. Additionally, some roads on the island can be narrow and winding, particularly in rural areas.
