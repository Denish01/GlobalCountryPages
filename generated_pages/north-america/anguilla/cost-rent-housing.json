Typical lease terms are one to two years, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Anguilla Rent Restriction Act, which regulates rent increases and provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as Saint Martin and the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla's housing costs are relatively high, due in part to its limited land area and high demand from tourists and expatriates.\n\nThe housing market in Anguilla is also influenced by the island's **tourist season**, which can drive up prices for short-term rentals and vacation homes. However, for long-term renters, there are opportunities to find more affordable options outside of the city center. It's worth noting that Anguilla has a relatively low **property tax** rate, which can make it an attractive option for property owners. Additionally, the island's **infrastructure** is well-developed, with modern amenities and services available in most areas.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,000-$1,500 | $800-$1,200 | basic amenities, small space |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,000 | $1,000-$1,600 | standard amenities, comfortable space |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,800-$3,000 | $1,500-$2,500 | family-friendly, modern amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $2,000-$3,500 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $3,000-$5,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $2,000-$3,500 | residential areas, comfortable living |\n| Rural | $1,500-$2,500 | scenic views, peaceful surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **The Valley**: $1,500-$3,000 per month, convenient location, modern amenities\n- **Sandy Ground**: $1,200-$2,500 per month, beachfront living, lively atmosphere\n- **Island Harbour**: $1,000-$2,000 per month, scenic views, peaceful surroundings\n- **Blowing Point**: $1,200-$2,500 per month, family-friendly, comfortable living\n- **Rendezvous Bay**: $1,500-$3,500 per month, luxury amenities, stunning views\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Anguilla [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find the best options\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market can be competitive\n- Negotiate the price and terms of your lease, if possible\n- Consider **furnished** apartments, as they can be more convenient for short-term renters\n- Be aware of **utility costs**, which are typically not included in the rent\n- [CALLOUT] Be cautious of **scams** and always verify the ownership and legitimacy of the property before signing a lease.",
