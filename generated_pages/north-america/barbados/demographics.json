The population growth rate is relatively slow, at around 0.3% per annum, which is largely due to a low fertility rate and a high life expectancy. The urban population accounts for around 45% of the total population, with the majority of people living in the capital city, Bridgetown, and its surrounding areas. The population density of Barbados is relatively high, at around 623 people per square kilometer, which is one of the highest in the Caribbean. The country has a relatively high life expectancy, at around 75 years, and a low fertility rate, at around 1.7 children per woman.\n\nThe population of Barbados has been shaped by its history, with the transatlantic slave trade and subsequent immigration from other parts of the world contributing to its diverse cultural heritage. Today, the population is largely urbanized, with many people living in the capital city and its surrounding areas. The country has a relatively high standard of living, with access to good healthcare, education, and other amenities. However, the population is also aging, with a significant proportion of people over the age of 65, which poses challenges for the country's pension and healthcare systems.\n\nThe migration patterns in Barbados are also worth noting, with many people moving to the country for work or study. The country has a relatively open immigration policy, and many people from other parts of the Caribbean and beyond have made Barbados their home.
