However, the country's strong economy and high GDP per capita (PPP) of $24,823 suggest that many residents enjoy a relatively high standard of living. The cost of living in Barbados can vary significantly depending on your lifestyle and personal choices, with budget-conscious individuals able to get by on around $1,800 per month, while those who prefer a more comfortable lifestyle may need to budget $5,500 or more per month. Compared to neighboring countries such as Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados is generally more expensive, but it also offers a more developed infrastructure and a wider range of amenities.\n\nThe cost of living in Barbados is influenced by a number of factors, including the high cost of imports, a relatively small and isolated market, and a strong focus on tourism. As a result, prices for goods and services can be higher than in some other countries in the region. However, the country's strong economy and high standard of living also mean that many residents enjoy a relatively high level of prosperity, with access to good healthcare, education, and other amenities. Overall, Barbados is a great choice for those who are looking for a comfortable and secure lifestyle in the Caribbean, but it may not be the most affordable option for budget-conscious travelers or expats.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 400 | 800 | 1,500 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 300 | 500 | 800 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 100 | 200 | 300 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 150 | 250 | 350 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 100 | 200 | 500 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 200 | 400 | 800 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 100 | 200 | 300 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 100 | 200 | 500 | |\n| **Total** | **1,800** | **3,000** | **5,500** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nAt the budget level of $1,800 per month, daily life in Barbados can be quite challenging, with limited options for entertainment and leisure activities.
