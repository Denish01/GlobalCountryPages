        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Barbados is a sovereign island country located in the eastern Caribbean Sea. The island was first inhabited by the <strong>Kalínago</strong> people, an indigenous group that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of Europeans. The first European to visit the island was <strong>Portuguese explorer Pedro Campos</strong> in 1536. However, it was the <strong>British</strong> who established the first permanent settlement in 1627, and the island remained under British control until it gained independence in 1966.</p>
        <p>The British established a <strong>plantation economy</strong> in Barbados, with sugar production being the primary industry. The island became a major producer of sugar, with <strong>African slaves</strong> being brought to the island to work on the plantations. The transatlantic slave trade played a significant role in the development of the island's economy and culture. After slavery was abolished in 1834, <strong>indentured servants</strong> from India and other parts of the world were brought to the island to work on the plantations.</p>
        <p>Barbados gained <strong>internal self-government</strong> in 1961, with <strong>Errol Barrow</strong> becoming the island's first prime minister. The country gained full independence from Britain on November 30, 1966, with Barrow serving as the country's first prime minister. Since then, Barbados has developed a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong>, with a prime minister and a bicameral legislature.</p>
        <p>The country has a <strong>classical Westminster system</strong> of government, with the monarch serving as head of state and a prime minister serving as head of government. The <strong>Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</strong> serves as the country's highest court, and the island is a member of the <strong>Commonwealth of Nations</strong>. Barbados has a <strong>mixed economy</strong>, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises.</p>
