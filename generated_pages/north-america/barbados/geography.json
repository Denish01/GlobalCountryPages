It is part of the **Lesser Antilles**, a chain of islands that stretches from the Greater Antilles to the coast of South America. Barbados is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the west, and is situated near the neighboring islands of Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nThe island's strategic location in the Caribbean makes it an important hub for trade and tourism. Its proximity to the equator and the trade winds that blow from the northeast contribute to its unique climate and geography. The surrounding waters are home to a diverse array of marine life, including coral reefs, sea turtles, and colorful fish species. The island's location also makes it susceptible to **hurricanes**, which can occur between June and November.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nBarbados is a relatively flat island, with a few rolling hills and a central ridge that runs from the northeast to the southwest.

The highest point on the island is **Mount Hillaby**, which rises to an elevation of 336 meters above sea level.\n\nThe island's coastline is characterized by a mix of sandy beaches, rocky shores, and coral reefs. The **west coast** is known for its calm and crystal-clear waters, making it a popular spot for swimming, snorkeling, and sunbathing. The **east coast**, on the other hand, is more rugged and exposed to the Atlantic Ocean, with powerful waves and strong currents. The island's interior is home to a variety of landscapes, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands, which support a diverse array of flora and fauna.\n\nThe island's unique geology and geography have also created a number of **natural attractions**, including the famous **Harrison's Cave**, a stunning limestone cave system that features underground pools, waterfalls, and towering columns.
