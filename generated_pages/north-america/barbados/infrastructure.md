[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Barbados has a relatively high level of infrastructure development, with a strong emphasis on providing modern amenities and services to its population. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the island's transportation network, including the expansion of the Grantley Adams International Airport and the improvement of road networks. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with the capital city Bridgetown and other urban centers generally having better access to infrastructure services. The government has been working to address this issue, with initiatives aimed at improving access to basic services such as water, sanitation, and electricity in rural areas.

The island's infrastructure development is also driven by its tourism industry, which is a significant contributor to the country's economy. As a result, there is a strong focus on providing high-quality infrastructure services to support the tourism sector, including modern hotels, restaurants, and other amenities. However, this has also led to concerns about the environmental impact of tourism development, and the need to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability.

Overall, Barbados' infrastructure is well-developed and provides a good foundation for economic growth and development. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need to improve access to infrastructure services in rural areas and to balance economic development with environmental sustainability.
