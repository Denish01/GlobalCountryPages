[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Barbados operates under a parliamentary system, where the **Prime Minister** serves as the head of government and is responsible for advising the **President**, who acts as the head of state. This system ensures a separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, promoting accountability and preventing any one branch from dominating the others. Barbados is a **unitary state**, meaning that the central government holds the primary authority, and there are no subordinate regional governments. The country's constitutional framework is based on the **common law** system, which emphasizes judicial precedents and case law.

The Barbadian government's structure is designed to facilitate cooperation and checks among its branches. The executive branch, led by the Prime Minister, is responsible for implementing policies and overseeing the administration of the government. The legislative branch, comprising the House of Assembly and the Senate, is tasked with making laws and approving the government's budget. The judicial branch, composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts, interprets laws and ensures their enforcement.

The government's ability to function effectively depends on the balance of power among its branches. In Barbados, this balance is maintained through a system of checks and balances, where each branch has some authority to limit the actions of the others. For example, the House of Assembly can approve or reject the government's budget, while the Prime Minister can advise the President to dissolve the Assembly and call for new elections.
