The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with several hospitals and clinics throughout the island, including the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown. However, the private healthcare system is often preferred by locals and foreigners alike due to its higher quality of care and shorter waiting times. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally free or low-cost, while foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for services or have private insurance to cover their costs. It is recommended that visitors to Barbados have some form of health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Barbados is well-regarded, with many medical professionals having received training in the UK or US. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between public and private facilities, with private facilities generally having more modern equipment and better staffing ratios. In general, locals and foreigners can expect to receive good quality medical care in Barbados, but it is still important to have some form of health insurance to cover any unexpected expenses. For foreigners, it is also a good idea to research the local healthcare system and to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist consultations, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Worldwide coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies throughout the island, with prices varying depending on the type of medication and whether it is available over-the-counter or by prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, with prices starting from around $5-$10 for basic medications such as pain relievers and antihistamines.\n- Prescription medications can range in price from $10-$50 or more per month, depending on the type of medication and the dosage required.\n- Pharmacists in Barbados are generally well-trained and can provide advice on the use of medications and any potential side effects.\n- It is recommended to bring any prescription medications with you when traveling to Barbados, as well as a copy of your prescription and any relevant medical documents.\n- Some medications may be available under different brand names or formulations in Barbados, so it is a good idea to research the local availability of any medications you may need before traveling.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 511, or to visit the emergency room at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown.
