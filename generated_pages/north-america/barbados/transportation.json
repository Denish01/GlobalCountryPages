The airport is located in the southeastern part of the island, about 13 kilometers east of the capital city, Bridgetown. Several major airlines, including British Airways, American Airlines, and Caribbean Airlines, offer direct flights to Barbados from destinations such as London, Miami, and New York. Additionally, there are connecting flights available from other Caribbean islands, making it a convenient hub for regional travel.\n\nFor those traveling overland, there are no direct land borders with neighboring countries, as Barbados is an island nation. However, visitors can arrive by sea, with several cruise lines and ferry services operating in the region. The Bridgetown Port is a popular stop for cruise ships, and there are also ferry connections available to nearby islands, such as Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent. It is worth noting that these options may be less frequent and less convenient than flying, but they can offer a unique and scenic way to experience the Caribbean.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nBarbados has a limited domestic air network, with no scheduled flights operating within the island. However, there are several charter airlines and helicopter services that offer scenic flights and transportation to nearby islands.

Prices vary depending on the route and type of aircraft, but expect to pay around $200-$500 for a one-way charter flight.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nBarbados has no rail network, making it unnecessary to consider train travel as an option.
