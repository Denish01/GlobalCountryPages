[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Barbados is based on the British model, with primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Primary education is compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 11, and is provided by government-run schools as well as private institutions. Secondary education is also compulsory, and students typically attend school from the age of 11 to 16. The quality of education in Barbados is generally high, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and extracurricular activities. Public schools are free and widely available, while private schools offer an alternative for families who can afford the tuition fees.

The Barbadian education system is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, administering exams, and providing resources and support to schools. The system is highly centralized, with a strong focus on standardized testing and assessment. This approach has helped to maintain high academic standards, but has also been criticized for being too rigid and inflexible. Despite these challenges, the education system in Barbados has produced a highly educated and skilled workforce, with many graduates going on to pursue successful careers in fields such as business, medicine, and law.

At the tertiary level, Barbados has a number of institutions that offer degree programs in a wide range of fields. The University of the West Indies (UWI) has a campus in Barbados, which offers undergraduate and graduate programs in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine. Other institutions, such as the Barbados Community College and the Samuel Jackman Prescod Institute of Technology, offer vocational and technical training programs. These institutions provide students with a range of options for pursuing higher education and career training, and have helped to contribute to the country's highly skilled and educated workforce.
