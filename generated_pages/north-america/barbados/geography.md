[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Barbados is an island nation located in the eastern Caribbean Sea, situated about 100 miles east of the Caribbean archipelago. It is part of the **Lesser Antilles**, a chain of islands that stretches from the Greater Antilles to the coast of South America. Barbados is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the west, and is situated near the neighboring islands of Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

The island's strategic location in the Caribbean makes it an important hub for trade and tourism. Its proximity to the equator and the trade winds that blow from the northeast contribute to its unique climate and geography. The surrounding waters are home to a diverse array of marine life, including coral reefs, sea turtles, and colorful fish species. The island's location also makes it susceptible to **hurricanes**, which can occur between June and November.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Barbados is a relatively flat island, with a few rolling hills and a central ridge that runs from the northeast to the southwest. The island's terrain is dominated by **coral limestone**, which has been shaped by millions of years of erosion and weathering. The landscape is dotted with sinkholes, caves, and underground streams, which are a testament to the island's **karst topography**. The highest point on the island is **Mount Hillaby**, which rises to an elevation of 336 meters above sea level.

The island's coastline is characterized by a mix of sandy beaches, rocky shores, and coral reefs. The **west coast** is known for its calm and crystal-clear waters, making it a popular spot for swimming, snorkeling, and sunbathing. The **east coast**, on the other hand, is more rugged and exposed to the Atlantic Ocean, with powerful waves and strong currents. The island's interior is home to a variety of landscapes, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands, which support a diverse array of flora and fauna.

The island's unique geology and geography have also created a number of **natural attractions**, including the famous **Harrison's Cave**, a stunning limestone cave system that features underground pools, waterfalls, and towering columns. The island's **beaches** are also a major draw, with their soft white sand, crystal-clear waters, and picturesque palm trees.
