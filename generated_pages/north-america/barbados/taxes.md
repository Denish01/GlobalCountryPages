[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Barbados operates on a **territorial taxation** system, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, but non-residents are taxed only on income derived from Barbadian sources. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must be physically present in Barbados for at least 183 days in a calendar year, or have a permanent home in Barbados and be present for at least 45 days in a calendar year. The tax system is designed to encourage foreign investment and business growth, while also providing a relatively high standard of living for residents.

The Barbadian tax system is administered by the Barbados Revenue Authority, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services. The authority also offers various incentives and exemptions to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth. For example, companies that operate in certain sectors, such as information technology or renewable energy, may be eligible for tax exemptions or reduced tax rates.
