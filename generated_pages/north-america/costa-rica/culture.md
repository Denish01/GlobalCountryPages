Costa Rica's culture is a unique blend of Spanish, African, and indigenous influences, which is reflected in its language, customs, and traditions. The country's cultural identity is deeply rooted in its history, with the Spanish colonization having a significant impact on the development of the nation. The official language, **Spanish**, is spoken by the vast majority of the population, and it is an essential part of the country's cultural heritage. Costa Rica is also home to several indigenous groups, including the Bribri and Cabécar, who have managed to preserve their languages and customs despite the influence of external factors.

The country's cultural makeup is also characterized by its **mestizo** population, which is a mix of Spanish, African, and indigenous ancestry.
