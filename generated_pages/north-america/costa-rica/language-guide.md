[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Costa Rica is dominated by Spanish, which is the official language and spoken by the vast majority of the population. There are also several regional dialects, with the most notable being the Central Valley dialect, which is considered the standard dialect of Costa Rican Spanish. Additionally, there are several minority languages spoken in the country, including indigenous languages such as Bribri and Cabécar, as well as English, which is widely spoken in tourist areas and among businesspeople. English is not as widely spoken as Spanish, but many Costa Ricans, particularly in the service industry, have a basic understanding of the language. Visitors who speak some Spanish will find it easier to communicate and navigate the country, but those who only speak English can still get by in tourist areas.

Costa Rica's language landscape is also influenced by its geographical location, with the country's proximity to the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean resulting in a unique blend of linguistic and cultural influences. The country's indigenous languages, such as Bribri and Cabécar, are also an important part of the country's linguistic heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote these languages. Despite the prevalence of Spanish, English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among young people and in business and tourism sectors.

The level of English proficiency in Costa Rica is moderate, with many Costa Ricans having a basic understanding of the language, particularly in tourist areas. However, it is still important for visitors to learn some basic Spanish phrases to enhance their travel experience and to show respect for the local culture. Visitors who speak some Spanish will find that they can communicate more effectively with locals, and that they can gain a deeper understanding of the country's culture and customs.
