The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major cities and towns. Most people in Costa Rica get around by bus, with the public bus system being an affordable and convenient option. However, in larger cities like San Jose, traffic can be a problem, and ride-hailing services or taxis may be a better option.\n\nThe country's geography, with its mountainous terrain and rugged coastline, can make transportation challenging in some areas. However, the government has invested heavily in improving the road network, and many roads are now paved and well-maintained. Additionally, there are many alternative transportation options available, such as shuttle services and bike rentals, which can be a great way to get around, especially in more rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $30-$50 | Good coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | $2.00-$5.00 | $50-$100 | Limited services, mainly in San Jose |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Available in most cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.80 | $5.00-$15.00 | Uber, Cabify available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20.00-$50.00 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Regular unleaded |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$3.00 | Limited parking options in some areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2.00-$5.00 | Limited toll roads, mainly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$30.00 | Frequent services, affordable |\n| Domestic Flight | $50.00-$200.00 | Limited routes, mainly to San Jose |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or shuttle services, which are often cheaper than taxis or ride-hailing services.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Cabify to get around, especially in larger cities.\n- Always negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before you start your journey, and make sure the meter is turned on.\n- Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night, and avoid traveling alone in isolated areas.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or to explore more rural areas, but be aware of the cost of fuel and parking.\n- Use apps like Waze or Google Maps to navigate the roads and avoid traffic congestion.",
