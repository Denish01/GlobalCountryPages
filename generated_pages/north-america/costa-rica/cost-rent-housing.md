[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Costa Rica is relatively stable, with a mix of short-term and long-term leases available. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters are advised to carefully review their contracts before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Nicaragua and Panama, Costa Rica's housing costs are relatively higher, but the country's strong economy and high standard of living make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote affordable housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable units.

The housing market in Costa Rica is also influenced by the country's tourism industry, with many properties being rented out on a short-term basis to visitors. This has led to an increase in prices in popular tourist areas, such as San Jose and the coastal regions. However, there are still many affordable options available, particularly in the suburbs and rural areas. Overall, Costa Rica's housing market offers a range of options to suit different budgets and preferences, from modern apartments in the city center to traditional houses in the countryside.
