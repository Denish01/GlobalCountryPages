        <h2>How Costa Rica Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Costa Rica is divided into 7 provinces, which are further subdivided into 82 cantons and 478 districts. The provinces are: Alajuela, Cartago, Guanacaste, Heredia, Limon, Puntarenas, and San Jose. This administrative structure allows for a relatively decentralized system of government, with each province having its own provincial capital and a degree of autonomy. The provinces are also grouped into three main regions: the Central Valley, the Pacific Coast, and the Caribbean Coast, each with its own unique character and attractions.</p>
        <p>The provinces of Costa Rica vary greatly in terms of population, economy, and geography. For example, the province of San Jose is the most populous and economically developed, while the province of Limon is the least populated and has a more rural economy.
