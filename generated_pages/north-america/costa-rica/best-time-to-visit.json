  "content": "The best time to visit Costa Rica is during the dry season, from December to April, when the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities. \n\n[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Costa Rica: December to April. Peak season: December to March. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: October and November due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nCosta Rica is a tropical country with two main climate zones: the tropical dry climate and the tropical wet climate. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by minimal rainfall and pleasant temperatures, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as the dry season is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, surfing, and wildlife watching, while the wet season can make some roads impassable and limit access to certain areas.\n\nThe country's geography also plays a role in its climate, with the coastal regions tend to be hotter and more humid than the mountainous regions. The **Central Valley**, where the capital city of San Jose is located, has a milder climate than the coastal regions. The dry season is also the peak tourist season, with many visitors flocking to the country's beautiful beaches, national parks, and wildlife reserves.\n\nThe wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices for accommodations and tourist services. However, some tourists prefer to visit during the wet season, as it is a great time to see the country's lush vegetation and vibrant wildlife, and to experience the **green season**, a period of rapid growth and renewal.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Dry and sunny | Med | $$ | Surfing, hiking, beach activities |\n| February | Dry and sunny | Med | $$ | Wildlife watching, birdwatching, festivals |\n| March | Dry and sunny | High | $$$ | Spring break, beach parties, outdoor adventures |\n| April | Dry and sunny | Med | $$ | Easter celebrations, cultural events, nature tours |\n| May | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Green season, birdwatching, photography |\n| June | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Surfing, fishing, relaxing in a tranquil atmosphere |\n| July | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Whale watching, sea turtle nesting, eco-tourism |\n| August | Rainy and humid | Med | $$ | Summer vacations, family travel, outdoor activities |\n| September | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Cultural events, festivals, food festivals |\n| October | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Nature tours, birdwatching, photography |\n| November | Rainy and humid | Low | $ | Green season, eco-tourism, relaxing in a peaceful atmosphere |\n| December | Dry and sunny | High | $$$ | Christmas and New Year's celebrations, holiday travel, outdoor adventures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiestas de San Jose | March | A cultural festival celebrating the city's patron saint, with music, dance, and food |\n| Envision Festival | February | A music and arts festival featuring local and international artists |\n| Costa Rica International Film Festival | December | A film festival showcasing local and international films |\n| Whale Watching Season | July to November | A great time to see humpback whales, blue whales, and other marine life |\n| Dia de la Independencia | September | A national holiday celebrating Costa Rica's independence from Spain |\n| Fiesta de la Virgin de los Angeles | August | A cultural festival celebrating the country's patron saint, with music, dance, and traditional food |\n| Limon Carnival | October | A vibrant carnival featuring music, dance, and costumes |\n| Christmas and New Year's Celebrations | December | A festive time to experience Costa Rican culture and traditions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Central Valley** has a milder climate than the coastal regions, making it a great destination year-round.\n- The **Caribbean Coast** has a more pronounced wet season, with heavier rainfall and higher humidity, but it's also a great time to see the region's lush vegetation and vibrant wildlife.\n- The **Pacific Coast** has a dry season that's ideal for surfing, beach activities, and outdoor adventures, but it can be hot and dry during the peak season.\n- The **Monteverde Cloud Forest** is a great destination year-round, but the dry season is the best time to see the cloud forest's unique flora and fauna.\n- The **Arenal Volcano** region has a more pronounced wet season, with heavier rainfall and higher humidity, but it's also a great time to see the region's lush vegetation and hot springs.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tourist services well in advance, especially during the peak season.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to May or from September to November, for lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack accordingly, with lightweight and quick-drying clothing, as well as a waterproof jacket or umbrella.\n- Be aware of the country's holidays and festivals, as they can affect the availability of tourist services and accommodations.\n- Consider purchasing travel insurance, as it can provide protection against unexpected events, such as natural disasters or trip cancellations.\n- Research and plan your itinerary according to the region you're visiting, taking into account the local climate, road conditions, and tourist services.",
