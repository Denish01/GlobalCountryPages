Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters are advised to carefully review their contracts before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Nicaragua and Panama, Costa Rica's housing costs are relatively higher, but the country's strong economy and high standard of living make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote affordable housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable units.\n\nThe housing market in Costa Rica is also influenced by the country's tourism industry, with many properties being rented out on a short-term basis to visitors. This has led to an increase in prices in popular tourist areas, such as San Jose and the coastal regions. However, there are still many affordable options available, particularly in the suburbs and rural areas. Overall, Costa Rica's housing market offers a range of options to suit different budgets and preferences, from modern apartments in the city center to traditional houses in the countryside.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$1,000 | $300-$600 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $600-$1,200 | family size, amenities like pool and gym |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,000-$1,800 | spacious, luxury finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$3,500 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $800-$1,500 | natural surroundings, off-grid options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- San Pedro: a trendy neighborhood with a mix of modern and traditional housing, rent range $800-$1,200 USD per month\n- Escalante: a family-friendly area with easy access to schools and amenities, rent range $600-$1,000 USD per month\n- Rohrmoser: a upscale neighborhood with luxury apartments and houses, rent range $1,200-$2,000 USD per month\n- Curridabat: a suburban area with a mix of modern and traditional housing, rent range $400-$800 USD per month\n- Tres Rios: a peaceful neighborhood with a natural surroundings, rent range $300-$600 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Costa Rica [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a reliable landlord and a fair price\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease\n- Be aware of scams, such as fake listings or unlicensed agents\n- Utilities like water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, but internet and cable TV may be\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, especially for long-term rentals\n- Consider renting outside of the city center for more affordable options and a more local experience",
