# The Truth About Costa Rica - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Costa Rica, which translates to "Rich Coast" in Spanish, has a rich and diverse history that spans thousands of years. The first inhabitants of the region were indigenous peoples, including the **Boruca**, **Cabécar**, and **Ngäbe** tribes, who migrated to the area from Mesoamerica around 10,000 years ago. In 1502, Christopher Columbus arrived in Costa Rica on his fourth voyage to the New World, and the region became a Spanish colony. The Spanish established the first permanent settlement in Costa Rica in 1561, and the country remained under Spanish rule for nearly three centuries.

Costa Rica declared its independence from Spain on September 15, 1821, along with the other Central American provinces. The country then became part of the **Federal Republic of Central America**, a short-lived union of five Central American states. In 1838, Costa Rica became an independent republic, with **Juan Mora Fernández** as its first head of state. The country's early years were marked by political instability, but it eventually developed a stable democratic government.

During the 19th century, Costa Rica experienced significant economic growth, driven primarily by the coffee and banana industries. The construction of the **Inter-Oceanic Railroad** in 1873 and the **Panama Canal** in 1914 further boosted the country's economy. In the 20th century, Costa Rica continued to develop its economy and consolidate its democracy, with a brief period of civil war in 1948. Today, Costa Rica is a **sovereign state** with a **presidential system** of government.
