  "content": "The official language spoken in Costa Rica is Spanish, and visitors will find that speaking some basic Spanish phrases can greatly enhance their travel experience.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Spanish\nWidely Spoken: English\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Costa Rica is dominated by Spanish, which is the official language and spoken by the vast majority of the population. There are also several regional dialects, with the most notable being the Central Valley dialect, which is considered the standard dialect of Costa Rican Spanish. Additionally, there are several minority languages spoken in the country, including indigenous languages such as Bribri and Cabécar, as well as English, which is widely spoken in tourist areas and among businesspeople. English is not as widely spoken as Spanish, but many Costa Ricans, particularly in the service industry, have a basic understanding of the language. Visitors who speak some Spanish will find it easier to communicate and navigate the country, but those who only speak English can still get by in tourist areas.\n\nCosta Rica's language landscape is also influenced by its geographical location, with the country's proximity to the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean resulting in a unique blend of linguistic and cultural influences. The country's indigenous languages, such as Bribri and Cabécar, are also an important part of the country's linguistic heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote these languages. Despite the prevalence of Spanish, English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among young people and in business and tourism sectors.\n\nThe level of English proficiency in Costa Rica is moderate, with many Costa Ricans having a basic understanding of the language, particularly in tourist areas. However, it is still important for visitors to learn some basic Spanish phrases to enhance their travel experience and to show respect for the local culture. Visitors who speak some Spanish will find that they can communicate more effectively with locals, and that they can gain a deeper understanding of the country's culture and customs.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola | OH-lah | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Gracias | GRAH-see-ahs |  |\n| Please | Por favor | paw-FAH-vor |  |\n| Yes / No | Sí / No | SEE / NOH |  |\n| Excuse me | Con permiso | kohn pehr-MEE-soh |  |\n| How much? | ¿Cuánto cuesta? | KWAHN-toh KWEHS-tah |  |\n| Where is...? | ¿Dónde está...? | DOHN-deh EH-stah |  |\n| I don't understand | No entiendo | noh ehn-tee-EHN-doh |  |\n| Do you speak English? | ¿Habla inglés? | AHB-lah eeng-lee-EHZ |  |\n| Help! | ¡Ayuda! | ah-YOO-dah |  |\n| Goodbye | Adiós | ah-DEE-yos | formal |\n| Sorry | Lo siento | LOH si-en-toh |  |\n| How are you? | ¿Cómo estás? | KOH-moh eh-STAH | informal |\n| What's your name? | ¿Cómo te llamas? | KOH-moh teh YAH-mahs |  |\n| I'm lost | Estoy perdido | eh-STOH pehr-DEE-thoh |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Uno | OO-noh |\n| 2 | Dos | dohs |\n| 3 | Tres | trays |\n| 4 | Cuatro | KWAH-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | SIHN-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | SAY-is |\n| 7 | Siete | see-EH-teh |\n| 8 | Ocho | OH-choh |\n| 9 | Nueve | nway-VAY |\n| 10 | Diez | dee-EHZ |\n| 100 | Cien | see-EHN |\n| 1000 | Mil | meel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when communicating with locals, using formal titles such as \"señor\" or \"señora\" when addressing older individuals.\n- Learn some basic Spanish phrases, such as \"gracias\" (thank you) and \"por favor\" (please), to show respect for the local culture.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the index finger or making loud noises.\n- Use a calm and patient tone when communicating, as Costa Ricans tend to value politeness and courtesy.\n- Be aware of nonverbal communication, such as body language and facial expressions, which can convey just as much information as spoken language.\n- Don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification if you don't understand something, using phrases such as \"¿Cómo?\" (how?) or \"¿Por qué?\" (why?).\n- Use a dictionary or phrasebook to help with communication, especially when dealing with complex or technical topics.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication on the go.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a Spanish language course or use online resources, such as Duolingo, to learn basic Spanish phrases and grammar.\n- Use a language exchange program, such as Tandem or HelloTalk, to practice speaking with native speakers.\n- Visit the Costa Rican tourism website or consult with a travel agent to get advice on language and communication in Costa Rica.",
