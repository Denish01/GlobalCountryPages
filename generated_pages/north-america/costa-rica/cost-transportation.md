[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Costa Rica has a well-developed transportation network, with a variety of options available for getting around, including public buses, taxis, ride-hailing services, and rental cars. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major cities and towns. Most people in Costa Rica get around by bus, with the public bus system being an affordable and convenient option. However, in larger cities like San Jose, traffic can be a problem, and ride-hailing services or taxis may be a better option.

The country's geography, with its mountainous terrain and rugged coastline, can make transportation challenging in some areas. However, the government has invested heavily in improving the road network, and many roads are now paved and well-maintained. Additionally, there are many alternative transportation options available, such as shuttle services and bike rentals, which can be a great way to get around, especially in more rural areas.
