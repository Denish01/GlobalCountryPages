[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Costa Rica's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, offering a range of options for both locals and foreigners. The public healthcare system, known as the Caja Costarricense de Seguridad Social (CCSS), provides universal coverage to all citizens and residents, including foreigners who have obtained residency. The public system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, wait times can be long, and some specialized treatments may not be available. In contrast, the private healthcare system in Costa Rica is also of high quality, with many modern hospitals and clinics, especially in San Jose and other major cities. Private healthcare is generally more expensive than public healthcare, but it often offers shorter wait times and more personalized care.

For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in Costa Rica, as the public system may not cover all services, especially for non-residents. Many private health insurance plans are available, including international plans that cover medical care in multiple countries. It's also important to note that some medical procedures and treatments may be more expensive in tourist areas, so it's a good idea to research and compare prices before seeking care. Additionally, some hospitals and clinics may have different pricing for foreigners, so it's essential to ask about costs and payment options before receiving treatment.
