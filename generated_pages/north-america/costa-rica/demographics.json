The population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country's population is expected to continue growing, but at a slower rate due to declining fertility rates. Urbanization is a significant trend in Costa Rica, with approximately 77% of the population living in urban areas. The capital city, San Jose, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 1 million people. Migration patterns in Costa Rica are characterized by a mix of internal and international migration, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of Costa Rica is also characterized by a high level of education, with a literacy rate of over 95%. This has contributed to the country's high human development index, which is one of the highest in Central America. The population is also relatively young, with a median age of 31.5 years. However, the population is aging, and the country is expected to face challenges related to an aging population in the coming years.\n\nCosta Rica's population is also influenced by its geography, with the country's mountainous terrain and coastal regions shaping the distribution of the population. The Central Valley, which includes the capital city San Jose, is the most populous region, with over 50% of the population living in this area.
