[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Costa Rica is based on the principles of **democracy** and **separation of powers**, with the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial** branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **President** serves as both the head of state and head of government, and is elected by popular vote for a four-year term. The **Legislative Assembly**, composed of 57 members, is responsible for making laws and exercising legislative power. The **Supreme Court**, composed of 22 judges, is the highest court in the land and is responsible for interpreting the **Constitution** and ensuring that laws are consistent with it.

The **separation of powers** is a key feature of Costa Rica's political system, with each branch having checks and balances on the others to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. This has helped to maintain **political stability** and prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual or group. Costa Rica's **unitary system** means that the central government has significant authority and control over the country, with the provinces and municipalities having limited autonomy.

The **Constitution** of Costa Rica, adopted in 1949, provides the framework for the country's government and politics. It establishes the principles of **democracy**, **human rights**, and **social justice**, and outlines the powers and responsibilities of the different branches of government. The **Constitution** has been amended several times since its adoption, with the most recent amendment being in 2015.
