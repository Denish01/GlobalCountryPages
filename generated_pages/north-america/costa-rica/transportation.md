[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Costa Rica has two main international airports, Juan Santamaría International Airport (SJO) in San José and Daniel Oduber Quirós International Airport (LIR) in Liberia. Juan Santamaría International Airport is the largest and busiest, with direct flights to many major cities in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Daniel Oduber Quirós International Airport, on the other hand, is a popular entry point for tourists visiting the northern region of Costa Rica, with direct flights from several US cities. You can also enter Costa Rica by land from Nicaragua or Panama, with several border crossings available. The most popular overland entry points are at Peñas Blancas on the Nicaraguan border and at Paso Canoas on the Panamanian border.

If you're planning to visit Costa Rica from a neighboring country, you can take a bus or shuttle from Nicaragua or Panama. Several bus companies, such as Tica Bus and Pulmitan, operate daily services from Managua, Nicaragua, and Panama City, Panama, to San José. The journey can take several hours, depending on the route and the number of stops along the way. Alternatively, you can take a taxi or rent a car and drive to Costa Rica from Nicaragua or Panama. However, be sure to check the current border crossing requirements and any travel restrictions before embarking on your journey.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Costa Rica has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between the country's main cities and tourist destinations. The main domestic airlines are Sansa Airlines, Nature Air, and Aerobell Airlines. Sansa Airlines is the largest domestic carrier, with flights to over 15 destinations, including popular tourist spots like Arenal, Monteverde, and Puerto Viejo. Nature Air operates flights to several destinations, including Tamarindo, Liberia, and Quepos. Aerobell Airlines offers flights to smaller towns and villages, such as Drake Bay and Tortuguero. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agent, and approximate costs range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and the airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Costa Rica does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. However, there are plans to develop a rail system in the future, which would connect the country's main cities and tourist destinations. For now, you'll need to rely on buses, taxis, or rental cars to get around.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Costa Rica has an extensive network of buses and coaches, with several companies operating intercity services. The main bus companies are Pulmitan, Tracopa, and Interbus. Pulmitan operates buses to several destinations, including San José, Alajuela, and Cartago. Tracopa operates buses to the southern region, including cities like Quepos and Puerto Jiménez. Interbus operates buses to several tourist destinations, including Arenal, Monteverde, and Tamarindo. Bus fares are relatively cheap, ranging from $2 to $10, depending on the route and the bus company. You can book bus tickets online or at the bus station, and it's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.
