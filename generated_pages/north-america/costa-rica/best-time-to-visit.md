[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Costa Rica: December to April. Peak season: December to March. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: October and November due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Costa Rica is a tropical country with two main climate zones: the tropical dry climate and the tropical wet climate. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by minimal rainfall and pleasant temperatures, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as the dry season is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, surfing, and wildlife watching, while the wet season can make some roads impassable and limit access to certain areas.

The country's geography also plays a role in its climate, with the coastal regions tend to be hotter and more humid than the mountainous regions. The **Central Valley**, where the capital city of San Jose is located, has a milder climate than the coastal regions. The dry season is also the peak tourist season, with many visitors flocking to the country's beautiful beaches, national parks, and wildlife reserves.

The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices for accommodations and tourist services. However, some tourists prefer to visit during the wet season, as it is a great time to see the country's lush vegetation and vibrant wildlife, and to experience the **green season**, a period of rapid growth and renewal.
