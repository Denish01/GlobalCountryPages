[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Costa Rica's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the **Caja Costarricense de Seguridad Social (CCSS)**, also known as Caja, being the primary public healthcare provider. The Caja is a universal healthcare system that provides comprehensive medical coverage to all citizens and registered residents. The quality of care in Costa Rica is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities, especially in urban areas like San Jose. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where resources and specialized care may be scarce.

The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with a wide range of medical services available, including specialist care and emergency services. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a more personalized and often faster service, but at a higher cost. Many private hospitals and clinics in Costa Rica cater to tourists and expats, offering a range of medical services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, and orthopedic procedures.

In terms of access to healthcare, urban areas like San Jose and Puerto Viejo have a wide range of medical facilities and services available, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Rural areas, however, may have more limited access to healthcare, with fewer medical facilities and services available. Despite this, the Costa Rican government has made efforts to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the establishment of community health clinics and mobile health units.
