While both countries offer a unique experience, they differ significantly in terms of cost of living. Costa Rica is generally more expensive than Panama, with higher prices for housing, food, and transportation. This is largely due to Costa Rica's stronger economy and higher demand for goods and services. However, Panama is not significantly cheaper, and the cost difference between the two countries is relatively small.\n\nIn terms of economic context, Costa Rica has a more developed tourism industry, which drives up prices for accommodations and activities. Panama, on the other hand, has a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on finance, logistics, and trade. This diversity helps to keep prices relatively stable and affordable. Overall, the cost of living in Costa Rica is around 10-20% higher than in Panama, making Panama a more attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Costa Rica (USD) | Panama (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $600 | $450 | 25% cheaper in Panama |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $400 | $300 | 25% cheaper in Panama |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $1,200 | $900 | 25% cheaper in Panama |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Costa Rica (USD) | Panama (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $15 | $12 | 20% cheaper in Panama |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $500 | $400 | 20% cheaper in Panama |\n| Beer (500ml) | $3 | $2.50 | 17% cheaper in Panama |\n| Coffee | $2 | $1.80 | 10% cheaper in Panama |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Costa Rica (USD) | Panama (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $60 | $50 | 17% cheaper in Panama |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1.50 | $1.20 | 20% cheaper in Panama |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1.10 | 8% cheaper in Panama |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Costa Rica (USD) | Panama (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $150 | $120 | 20% cheaper in Panama |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $40 | 20% cheaper in Panama |\n| Mobile Plan | $30 | $25 | 17% cheaper in Panama |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Costa Rica (USD) | Panama (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $1,200 | $1,000 | 17% cheaper in Panama |\n| Mid-Range | $2,000 | $1,600 | 20% cheaper in Panama |\n| Comfortable | $3,500 | $2,800 | 20% cheaper in Panama |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Costa Rica is cheaper for:**\n  - Eco-tourism activities, such as ziplining and wildlife watching\n  - High-end accommodations and resorts\n  - Luxury goods and shopping\n  - Access to top-notch healthcare facilities\n- **Panama is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, particularly in urban areas\n  - Food and dining, including groceries and restaurant meals\n  - Transportation, including taxis and public transit\n  - Utilities and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Panama offers a more affordable cost of living, with significant savings on housing, food, and transportation. However, Costa Rica's stronger economy and more developed tourism industry make it a better choice for those who value convenience, luxury, and access to high-end amenities. Families may prefer Costa Rica's more established education system and wider range of activities and attractions. Ultimately, the choice between Costa Rica and Panama depends on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences. By carefully considering the costs and benefits of each country, travelers and expats can make an informed decision that suits their needs and budget.\n\nIn terms of overall value, Panama offers a more affordable and balanced lifestyle, with a mix of modern amenities and traditional culture. Costa Rica, on the other hand, provides a more upscale and tourist-oriented experience, with a focus on eco-tourism and luxury activities. While both countries have their strengths and weaknesses, Panama's lower cost of living and more diverse economy make it a more attractive option for those looking for a affordable and sustainable lifestyle in Central America.",
