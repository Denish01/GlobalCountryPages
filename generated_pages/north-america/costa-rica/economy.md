Costa Rica has a stable and growing economy, classified as upper-middle income by the World Bank. The country has made significant progress in recent decades, with a strong focus on social development, environmental protection, and economic diversification. Costa Rica's economy is driven by a combination of traditional industries such as agriculture and manufacturing, as well as a thriving services sector and a growing tourism industry. The country's strategic location in Central America, with access to both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, makes it an attractive location for international trade and investment.
