Costa Rica is known for its high standard of living, stable economy, and well-developed tourism industry, which contributes to its relatively higher cost of living. In contrast, Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in Central America, with a lower cost of living and a more challenging economic environment. Overall, Nicaragua offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Costa Rica has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, which drives up prices for goods and services. Nicaragua, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a greater reliance on agriculture and remittances from abroad. As a result, Nicaragua's cost of living is generally lower, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle. The cost difference between the two countries can range from 30-40%, with Nicaragua being the more affordable option.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Costa Rica (USD) | Nicaragua (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 600 | 400 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 400 | 250 | 37% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 800 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Costa Rica (USD) | Nicaragua (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 300 | 40% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 2 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1.50 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Costa Rica (USD) | Nicaragua (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 70 | 40 | 43% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.50 | 1 | 33% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1 | 17% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Costa Rica (USD) | Nicaragua (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 70 | 30% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Costa Rica (USD) | Nicaragua (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,800 | 30% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Costa Rica is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and dining experiences\n- Luxury accommodations and tourist activities\n- Access to modern amenities and infrastructure\n- High-quality healthcare services\n- **Nicaragua is cheaper for:**\n- Affordable housing and rent\n- Local food and dining options\n- Transportation and fuel costs\n- Basic utilities and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle and priorities.
