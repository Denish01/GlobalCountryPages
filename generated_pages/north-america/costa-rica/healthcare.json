The Caja is a universal healthcare system that provides comprehensive medical coverage to all citizens and registered residents. The quality of care in Costa Rica is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities, especially in urban areas like San Jose. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where resources and specialized care may be scarce.\n\nThe public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with a wide range of medical services available, including specialist care and emergency services. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a more personalized and often faster service, but at a higher cost. Many private hospitals and clinics in Costa Rica cater to tourists and expats, offering a range of medical services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, and orthopedic procedures.\n\nIn terms of access to healthcare, urban areas like San Jose and Puerto Viejo have a wide range of medical facilities and services available, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Rural areas, however, may have more limited access to healthcare, with fewer medical facilities and services available. Despite this, the Costa Rican government has made efforts to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the establishment of community health clinics and mobile health units.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital CIMA | San Jose | Private | Cardiology, Oncology, Orthopedics | Yes |\n| Hospital Clinica Biblica | San Jose | Private | General Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics | Yes |\n| Hospital San Juan de Dios | San Jose | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Emergency | Limited |\n| Hospital Monseñor Sanabria | Puntarenas | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Catolica | San Jose | Private | General Medicine, Surgery, Orthopedics | Yes |\n| Hospital Beacon | Escazu | Private | General Medicine, Surgery, Cosmetic Surgery | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for tourists and expats, as it provides access to private healthcare facilities and services.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including the Caja, which provides comprehensive medical coverage to registered residents.\n- **Expats** can purchase private health insurance, which often includes coverage for medical evacuation and repatriation.\n- **Costs** vary depending on the type of insurance and the level of coverage, but expect to pay around $50-100 per month for a basic plan.\n- **Pre-existing conditions** may be excluded from coverage, so it's essential to disclose any medical conditions when applying for insurance.\n- **Group insurance plans** are available for companies and organizations, providing coverage for employees and their families.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in Costa Rica, with many pharmacies located throughout the country.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also readily available, including pain relievers, antihistamines, and antibiotics.\n- **Common brands** like Tylenol, Advil, and Benadryl are available, as well as local brands like **Tafi** and **Genfar**.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many pharmacies require a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- **Costs** are generally lower than in the US, with many medications available for around $5-10 per prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **Typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Costa Rica.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be working with animals or spending time in rural areas.\n- **Malaria** and **Dengue fever** are present in some areas of Costa Rica, especially during the rainy season.\n- **Zika virus** is also present in Costa Rica, and pregnant women should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Costa Rica, but it's still recommended to drink bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, but it's essential to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and seafood.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Costa Rica** is a popular destination for medical tourism, with many private hospitals and clinics offering a range of medical services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, and orthopedic procedures.\n- **Accredited hospitals** like Hospital CIMA and Hospital Clinica Biblica offer high-quality medical care and are popular with medical tourists.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many medical procedures costing 50-70% less than in the US.\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, dental implants, and joint replacement surgery.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **911** is the emergency number in Costa Rica, and callers can expect to receive assistance in English.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with many private hospitals and clinics offering emergency transportation services.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a GPS device.\n- **Insurance claims** can be filed with private insurance providers, and many hospitals and clinics have dedicated staff to assist with insurance claims.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, and private insurance providers often include coverage for medical evacuation and repatriation.",
