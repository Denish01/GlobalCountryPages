Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the law, but it is essential to carefully review the lease agreement before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Saint Martin and Anguilla, Sint Maarten's housing costs are relatively high, due to its popularity as a tourist destination and limited availability of housing.\n\nThe housing market in Sint Maarten is also influenced by the island's **tourism industry**, with many apartments and houses being rented out to tourists on a short-term basis. This can drive up prices and make it challenging for long-term renters to find affordable accommodation. However, for those who are willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available in the surrounding areas. It is also worth noting that the **hurricane season**, which runs from June to November, can impact the housing market, with some landlords increasing prices or requiring tenants to purchase **hurricane insurance**.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,000-$1,500 | $800-$1,200 | (small, basic accommodation) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,000 | $900-$1,500 | (standard apartment with kitchen and bathroom) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,800 | $1,200-$2,000 | (family-sized apartment with extra bedroom) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$3,500 | $1,800-$2,500 | (spacious apartment with extra bedroom and living area) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $4,000-$6,000 | (prime locations, such as beachfront or downtown) |\n| Suburbs | $2,500-$4,000 | (residential areas, such as Simpson Bay or Cupecoy) |\n| Rural | $1,500-$2,500 | (less developed areas, such as the hills or countryside) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Philipsburg**: the capital city, with a range of accommodation options, including apartments and houses, and a vibrant nightlife, with rents ranging from $1,200 to $2,500 per month\n- **Simpson Bay**: a popular area for expats, with a range of apartments and houses, and a beautiful beach, with rents ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 per month\n- **Cupecoy**: a residential area with a range of apartments and houses, and a beautiful beach, with rents ranging from $1,200 to $2,500 per month\n- **Maho**: a popular area for tourists, with a range of apartments and houses, and a beautiful beach, with rents ranging from $1,500 to $3,000 per month\n- **Lower Prince's Quarter**: a residential area with a range of apartments and houses, and a short commute to Philipsburg, with rents ranging from $900 to $1,800 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Sint Maarten [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and prices before starting your search, to get an idea of what to expect\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent, who can help you find the right accommodation and negotiate the best price\n- Carefully review the lease agreement, to ensure you understand the terms and conditions\n- Consider purchasing **renters insurance**, to protect your belongings and liability\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market can be competitive, and the best properties may be rented out quickly\n- Check if utilities, such as **electricity** and **water**, are included in the rent, or if you need to pay them separately\n- Consider the **commute time** and **transportation options**, when choosing a neighborhood and accommodation\n- Be aware of potential **scams**, and never pay a deposit or rent without seeing the property first and signing a lease agreement.",
