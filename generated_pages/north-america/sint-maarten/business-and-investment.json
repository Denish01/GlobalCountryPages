The government has implemented various measures to attract foreign investment, including the establishment of a free zone and a range of tax incentives.

The government is working to address these issues and improve the overall business climate.\n\nThe island's strategic location in the northeastern Caribbean, with a well-developed port and airport, makes it an attractive location for logistics and trade.
