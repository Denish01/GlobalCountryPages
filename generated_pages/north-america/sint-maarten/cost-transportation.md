[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Sint Maarten is a small island with a relatively well-developed transportation system, making it easy to get around without a car. The main transportation modes on the island are taxis, buses, and rental cars. The quality of public transit is good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and villages. Most people get around the island using taxis or rental cars, as the public bus system can be limited in terms of routes and frequency. However, the bus system is an affordable and convenient way to travel, especially for short distances.

The island's compact size and relatively flat terrain make it easy to navigate, and many tourists opt to walk or bike around the capital city of Philipsburg. The city has a scenic waterfront area with shops, restaurants, and bars, and the nearby Great Bay Beach is a popular spot for swimming and sunbathing. For longer distances, taxis and rental cars are readily available, and many hotels and resorts offer shuttle services to and from the airport.
