The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality than the private system, with longer wait times and fewer specialized services available. Locals and foreigners can access both public and private healthcare services, but foreigners may be required to pay out-of-pocket for treatment or have international health insurance to cover their medical expenses. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and patient fees, while the private system is largely self-funded through patient payments and private insurance.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Sint Maarten can vary significantly depending on the provider and the specific services being sought. Public hospitals and clinics may have more limited resources and equipment, while private hospitals and clinics may offer more specialized and high-tech services. In general, foreigners and those with private insurance may prefer to seek medical care at private facilities, which are often staffed by English-speaking doctors and offer more comprehensive services. However, even at private facilities, the cost of medical care can be high, and patients may be required to pay upfront for treatment or provide proof of insurance coverage.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Public clinics may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$200 | $200-$500 | Private specialists may have more advanced training and equipment |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$250 | Private dentists may offer more cosmetic and specialized services |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private optometrists may have more advanced diagnostic equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private labs may offer faster turnaround times and more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $200-$500 | May require upfront payment or proof of insurance |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more luxurious amenities and personalized care |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | May require specialized equipment and personnel |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | May require referral from a specialist and upfront payment |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | May be available at public or private facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, advanced diagnostic testing, and private hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Comprehensive medical coverage, including evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications may require a doctor's prescription and can cost $10-$50 per month\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and may cost $5-$20 per month\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked and offer a wide range of medications, including **brand-name** and **generic** options\n- Patients may be required to pay upfront for medications, but some insurance plans may offer reimbursement or discounts\n- **Vaccinations** and other preventive medications may be available at public health clinics or private pharmacies\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, patients should call 911 or visit the emergency room at the **St. Maarten Medical Center**, which is the main public hospital on the island.
