[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Sint Maarten is relatively small and competitive, with a high demand for apartments and houses, particularly in the city center of Philipsburg. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the law, but it is essential to carefully review the lease agreement before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Saint Martin and Anguilla, Sint Maarten's housing costs are relatively high, due to its popularity as a tourist destination and limited availability of housing.

The housing market in Sint Maarten is also influenced by the island's **tourism industry**, with many apartments and houses being rented out to tourists on a short-term basis. This can drive up prices and make it challenging for long-term renters to find affordable accommodation. However, for those who are willing to look outside of the city center, there are more affordable options available in the surrounding areas. It is also worth noting that the **hurricane season**, which runs from June to November, can impact the housing market, with some landlords increasing prices or requiring tenants to purchase **hurricane insurance**.
