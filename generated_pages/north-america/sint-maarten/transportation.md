[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in Sint Maarten is the Princess Juliana International Airport, which is located on the Dutch side of the island and serves as a hub for flights to and from the United States, Canada, Europe, and other Caribbean islands. Direct flights are available from major cities such as New York, Miami, and Amsterdam, making it easy to get to the island from almost anywhere in the world. The airport is also a popular stop for cruise ships, and many passengers arrive on the island by sea.

In addition to flying, it is also possible to enter Sint Maarten by sea, either on a cruise ship or by taking a ferry from neighboring islands such as Anguilla or Saint Martin. There are no overland entry points, as Sint Maarten is an island. Once you arrive, you can take a taxi or bus to your destination, or rent a car to explore the island on your own.

There are no domestic flights within Sint Maarten, as the island is small and it is easy to get around by car or taxi. However, there are flights available to neighboring islands such as Anguilla and Saint Martin, which can be a convenient way to explore the region. If you do need to take a domestic flight, it is best to book in advance to ensure availability, and to compare prices across different airlines to find the best deal. Approximate costs for domestic flights in the region can range from $100 to $300 per person, depending on the route and the time of year.
