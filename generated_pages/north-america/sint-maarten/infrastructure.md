Sint Maarten's infrastructure is characterized by a high level of development, with a strong emphasis on supporting the island's thriving tourism industry. Recent investments have focused on upgrading and expanding the island's amenities, including its roads, utilities, and telecommunications networks. However, there is a notable urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with the capital city of Philipsburg and other urban areas generally having better access to services and amenities than rural areas.

The island's infrastructure has been shaped by its history as a Dutch territory, with many of its systems and institutions modeled on those in the Netherlands. This has contributed to a high level of development and a strong focus on quality and reliability. However, the island's small size and limited resources also present challenges, particularly in terms of maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure.

Despite these challenges, Sint Maarten has made significant progress in recent years in developing its infrastructure, with a range of projects aimed at improving the island's roads, utilities, and telecommunications networks. These efforts have helped to support the island's economic growth and improve the quality of life for its residents.
