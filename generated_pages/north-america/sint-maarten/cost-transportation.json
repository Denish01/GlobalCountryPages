The main transportation modes on the island are taxis, buses, and rental cars. The quality of public transit is good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and villages. Most people get around the island using taxis or rental cars, as the public bus system can be limited in terms of routes and frequency. However, the bus system is an affordable and convenient way to travel, especially for short distances.\n\nThe island's compact size and relatively flat terrain make it easy to navigate, and many tourists opt to walk or bike around the capital city of Philipsburg. The city has a scenic waterfront area with shops, restaurants, and bars, and the nearby Great Bay Beach is a popular spot for swimming and sunbathing. For longer distances, taxis and rental cars are readily available, and many hotels and resorts offer shuttle services to and from the airport.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $60 | Good coverage of major towns and villages |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly connecting Philipsburg to nearby villages |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$15 | Available at the airport and in major towns |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5 | $1.50 | $10-$15 | Uber and Lyft available, but not always reliable |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on the rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking spaces available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, as there are no toll roads on the island |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$30 | Limited options, mainly connecting Philipsburg to nearby islands |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route to nearby islands, such as Anguilla or Saint Martin |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use public transportation or walk whenever possible to save money on transport costs.\n- Download ride-hailing apps like Uber or Lyft to book taxis in advance.\n- Always negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, especially at night or during peak hours.\n- Be aware of traffic rules and regulations, such as wearing seatbelts and not using mobile phones while driving.\n- Consider renting a car for longer stays or to explore the island's more remote areas.\n- Be mindful of parking restrictions and fees, especially in crowded areas like Philipsburg.",
