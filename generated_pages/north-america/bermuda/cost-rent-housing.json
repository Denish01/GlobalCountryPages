  "content": "The cost of rent in Bermuda can range from $2,000 to $6,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, depending on the location and quality of the accommodation, with housing prices being relatively high due to the territory's limited land availability and high demand.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP per Capita (PPP): $124,253\nAffordability Rating: Very Expensive\nAverage Monthly Rent (1BR, City Center): $3,500 USD / 3,500 BMD\nAverage Monthly Rent (1BR, Outside Center): $2,500 USD / 2,500 BMD\nProperty Purchase (per sqm, City Center): $6,000 USD\nCurrency: BMD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]\nBermuda's housing market is characterized by high demand and limited supply, resulting in relatively high prices for both rentals and property purchases. The typical lease term in Bermuda is one to two years, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Bermuda Landlord and Tenant Act, which provides guidelines for rent increases, eviction notices, and maintenance responsibilities. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as the United States, Bermuda's housing costs are significantly higher due to its unique location, limited land availability, and high standard of living.\n\nThe rental market in Bermuda is highly competitive, with many apartments and houses being rented out to expats and tourists. As a result, renters should be prepared to act quickly when applying for a property, and be flexible with their requirements. It is also essential to work with a reputable real estate agent to ensure that the rental process is smooth and hassle-free. Additionally, renters should be aware of their rights and responsibilities under the Bermuda Landlord and Tenant Act, and seek advice from a lawyer or tenant advocacy group if necessary.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $2,000-$3,000 | $1,500-$2,500 | (typical quality, 300-500 sqft) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $2,000-$3,500 | (what to expect, 500-700 sqft) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $4,000-$6,000 | $3,000-$5,000 | (family size, 800-1,200 sqft) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $6,000-$10,000 | $5,000-$8,000 | (spacious, 1,200-1,800 sqft) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $6,000-$10,000 | (prime locations, such as Hamilton) |\n| Suburbs | $4,000-$8,000 | (residential areas, such as Pembroke) |\n| Rural | $3,000-$6,000 | (if applicable, such as St. George's) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Hamilton**: the capital city, with a range of rental options from $2,000 to $6,000 per month, and a vibrant nightlife and shopping scene\n- **Pembroke**: a suburb of Hamilton, with a range of rental options from $1,500 to $4,000 per month, and a more laid-back atmosphere\n- **Warwick**: a parish located just outside of Hamilton, with a range of rental options from $1,500 to $3,500 per month, and a beautiful beach\n- **Smith's**: a parish located in the central part of the island, with a range of rental options from $1,500 to $3,000 per month, and a rural atmosphere\n- **St. George's**: a historic town located on the eastern end of the island, with a range of rental options from $1,000 to $2,500 per month, and a charming atmosphere\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Bermuda [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to understand the going rates for rentals and property purchases\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property and navigate the rental process\n- Be prepared to act quickly when applying for a property, as the rental market is highly competitive\n- Ensure that you understand your rights and responsibilities under the Bermuda Landlord and Tenant Act\n- Be aware of any additional costs, such as utilities and furniture, when budgeting for your rental\n- Consider purchasing a property instead of renting, as it may be more cost-effective in the long run, especially with the high rental prices in Bermuda.",
