[SECTION] How Expensive Is Bermuda? [/SECTION]
Bermuda is one of the most expensive territories in the world, with a high cost of living that is driven by its remote location and limited land area. The territory has a strong economy, driven by tourism and financial services, which has led to a high demand for goods and services, and consequently, high prices. Compared to its neighbors in the United States, Bermuda is significantly more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being substantially higher. For example, a meal at a mid-range restaurant in Bermuda can cost upwards of $50 per person, while a similar meal in the United States might cost around $20-30 per person.

The high cost of living in Bermuda is also due to the fact that many goods have to be imported, which increases their cost. Additionally, the territory has a high standard of living, with a strong emphasis on quality and luxury, which also drives up prices. Overall, Bermuda is a very expensive destination, and visitors and residents should be prepared for high prices.
