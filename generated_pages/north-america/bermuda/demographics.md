[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Bermuda's population size is relatively small, with the majority of residents living in urban areas, particularly in the capital city of Hamilton. The population growth rate is relatively low, which can be attributed to a combination of factors, including a low fertility rate and a high level of emigration. The population is also aging, with a median age of 43 years, which can have implications for the territory's economy and social services. Urbanization is a significant trend in Bermuda, with the entire population living in urban areas, and the capital city of Hamilton being the main hub of activity.

The population of Bermuda is also characterized by a high level of migration, with many residents moving to and from the territory for work, education, or other opportunities. This has contributed to a diverse and cosmopolitan population, with a mix of Bermudian, British, American, and other international influences. The population is also relatively affluent, with a high standard of living and a strong economy based on tourism, finance, and other services.

In terms of population trends, Bermuda's population is expected to continue growing at a slow rate, driven by a combination of natural increase and net migration. However, the territory's population is also aging, which can have implications for the labor market, healthcare, and other social services. To address these challenges, the government of Bermuda has implemented policies aimed at promoting population growth, attracting new residents, and supporting the needs of an aging population.
