[SECTION] Overview: Bermuda vs United States [/SECTION]
Bermuda and the United States have distinct economic contexts that impact their cost of living. Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic, with a high standard of living and a strong economy driven by tourism and finance. The United States, on the other hand, is a large and diverse country with a wide range of economic conditions. Overall, Bermuda's cost of living is higher due to its remote location, limited land area, and high demand for goods and services. The country's strong economy and high standard of living come at a price, with expensive housing, food, and transportation.

The cost of living difference between Bermuda and the United States is significant, with Bermuda being roughly 20-30% more expensive. This is largely due to the high cost of housing, with the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Hamilton, Bermuda's capital city, being around $2,500 per month, compared to around $1,800 per month in a major US city. Food prices are also higher in Bermuda, with the average meal at a restaurant costing around $25, compared to around $18 in the US.
