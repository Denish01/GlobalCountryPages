# Bermuda Visa & Entry Requirements

You do not need a visa to enter Bermuda if you are a citizen of certain countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, but it is essential to verify the current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Bermuda before traveling.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Bermuda before traveling. [/CALLOOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Bermuda has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of over 100 countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. Citizens of countries that do not require a visa can stay in Bermuda for up to six months, depending on their nationality. Bermuda's visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate tourism and business travel. The country's proximity to the United States and its historical ties to the United Kingdom have shaped its visa policy, with citizens of these countries enjoying relatively easy access to the island.

Bermuda's visa policy is also influenced by its membership in the British Commonwealth, which allows citizens of other Commonwealth countries to enter the island with relative ease. However, citizens of countries that are not part of the Commonwealth or do not have a visa waiver agreement with Bermuda will need to apply for a visa at a Bermudian embassy or consulate before traveling to the island.
