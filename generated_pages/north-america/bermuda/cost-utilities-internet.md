[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Bermuda's utility infrastructure is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and telecommunications services. The cost of utilities in Bermuda is generally stable, but can fluctuate due to seasonal variations in demand. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the summer months when air conditioning usage is more prevalent. The Bermuda Government regulates utility prices to ensure they remain reasonable and affordable for residents. The high **GDP per capita** of $124,253 and relatively low **education spend** of 1.9% of GDP may contribute to the overall high cost of living in Bermuda, including utility costs.

The quality of utility services in Bermuda is generally high, with a focus on reliability and customer service. The island's small size and relatively low population density make it easier to maintain and upgrade utility infrastructure, which helps to keep costs under control. However, the cost of utilities in Bermuda is still relatively high compared to other countries, due in part to the island's remote location and reliance on imported fuel.
