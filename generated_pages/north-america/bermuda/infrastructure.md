[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Bermuda's infrastructure is characterized by a high level of development, with significant investments in recent years to maintain and upgrade its systems. The territory's small size and relatively high population density have enabled the development of a comprehensive and efficient infrastructure network. However, there is a notable urban-rural gap, with the capital city of Hamilton and surrounding areas generally having better infrastructure than more rural areas. The government has been working to address this disparity through targeted investments and development projects.

Bermuda's infrastructure development is also driven by its strong tourism industry, which requires high-quality amenities and services to support the territory's economy. As a result, Bermuda has invested heavily in its transportation systems, energy generation, and water supply infrastructure. The territory's infrastructure is also designed to be resilient in the face of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which can pose a significant threat to the island.

Overall, Bermuda's infrastructure is well-suited to support the territory's economy and population, with a strong focus on maintaining high-quality systems and services. The government continues to invest in infrastructure development, with a focus on upgrading existing systems and developing new ones to support the territory's growth and development.
