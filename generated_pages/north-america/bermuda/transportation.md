[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Bermuda's main international airport, L.F. Wade International Airport (BDA), is located in St. George's Parish, about 10 miles northeast of the capital city Hamilton. The airport receives direct flights from several major hubs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, including New York, Boston, Miami, Toronto, and London. If you're traveling from other parts of the world, you may need to connect through one of these hubs to reach Bermuda. There are no overland entry points, as Bermuda is an island territory in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The airport is well-connected to the rest of the island, with several transportation options available, including taxis, buses, and rental cars. You can also take a ferry or a private boat to reach the island, although these options are less common. The airport is relatively small, making it easy to navigate and find your way to your destination. Once you arrive, you can exchange your currency for Bermudian dollars, which are pegged to the US dollar, or use your credit card to pay for services.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Bermuda has a limited domestic air network, with no scheduled flights connecting the island's main towns and cities. However, you can take a charter flight or a private plane to reach some of the island's more remote areas, such as the outer islands. The main domestic airline is Bermuda Airlines, which offers charter services and private flights. If you need to book a domestic flight, it's best to contact the airline directly or use a local travel agent. The cost of a domestic flight can vary depending on the route and the type of service, but expect to pay around $100-$200 per person for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Bermuda has no rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a railway system. As a result, you won't be able to take a train to get around the island. However, the island's bus system is well-developed, and you can use it to travel between the main towns and cities. The lack of a rail network is due to the island's small size and the fact that it's a relatively flat and easy-to-navigate territory.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Bermuda has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect the main towns and cities. The island's public transportation system is operated by the Bermuda Department of Public Transportation, which offers a range of services, including regular bus routes and express coaches. You can use the bus system to travel between Hamilton, St. George's, and other major towns, as well as to reach some of the island's more remote areas. The cost of a bus ticket is around $3-$5 per person for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and the type of service.
