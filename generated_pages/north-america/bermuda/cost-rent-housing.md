[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Bermuda's housing market is characterized by high demand and limited supply, resulting in relatively high prices for both rentals and property purchases. The typical lease term in Bermuda is one to two years, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Bermuda Landlord and Tenant Act, which provides guidelines for rent increases, eviction notices, and maintenance responsibilities. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as the United States, Bermuda's housing costs are significantly higher due to its unique location, limited land availability, and high standard of living.

The rental market in Bermuda is highly competitive, with many apartments and houses being rented out to expats and tourists. As a result, renters should be prepared to act quickly when applying for a property, and be flexible with their requirements. It is also essential to work with a reputable real estate agent to ensure that the rental process is smooth and hassle-free. Additionally, renters should be aware of their rights and responsibilities under the Bermuda Landlord and Tenant Act, and seek advice from a lawyer or tenant advocacy group if necessary.
