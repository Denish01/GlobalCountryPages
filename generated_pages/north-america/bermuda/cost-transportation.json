The main modes of transportation are buses and taxis, with ferries also available for traveling to nearby islands. The quality of public transit is good, with frequent bus services and a comprehensive network of routes covering most areas of the island. Most people get around by bus or taxi, as the island is relatively small and traffic is generally light.\n\nThe island's compact size and scenic roads also make it a popular destination for cyclists and pedestrians, with many bike rental shops and walking trails available. However, the lack of ride-hailing services and limited taxi availability can make it difficult to get around at night or in rural areas. Additionally, the island's narrow roads and limited parking can make driving a challenge, especially for visitors.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $3.50 | $65 | Comprehensive network, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly for tourists |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $7 | $2.50 | $10-$20 | Limited availability at night |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, by taxi or shuttle |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $2.25 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $2.50 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-$100 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited availability, especially in Hamilton |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited services, mainly for tourists |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or using the bus network instead of taxis.\n- The Bermuda Department of Public Transportation website and app provide useful information on bus routes and schedules.\n- Be aware that taxis may not always be available, especially at night, so plan ahead and book in advance if possible.\n- When renting a car, be sure to check the insurance coverage and driving requirements, as they may differ from those in your home country.\n- Always wear a helmet when cycling, as it is mandatory by law.\n- Consider purchasing a **Bermuda Transportation Pass**, which grants access to public transportation and discounts on ferry and taxi services.",
