This is in contrast to a worldwide tax system, where all income earned by residents is subject to tax, regardless of where it is earned. Bermuda's tax system is designed to attract foreign investment and talent to the island, and it has a number of incentives and exemptions to encourage businesses and individuals to set up operations there. The country's **residency rules** for tax purposes are based on the number of days spent in Bermuda, with individuals who spend more than 90 days in the country in a calendar year considered residents for tax purposes.\n\nBermuda's tax system is also characterized by a lack of **taxation on income**, with no income tax, payroll tax, or wealth tax levied on residents. This makes it an attractive destination for high-net-worth individuals and businesses looking to minimize their tax liability.
