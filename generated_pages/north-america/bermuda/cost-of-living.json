[/SECTION]\nBermuda is one of the most expensive territories in the world, with a high cost of living that is driven by its remote location and limited land area. The territory has a strong economy, driven by tourism and financial services, which has led to a high demand for goods and services, and consequently, high prices. Compared to its neighbors in the United States, Bermuda is significantly more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being substantially higher. For example, a meal at a mid-range restaurant in Bermuda can cost upwards of $50 per person, while a similar meal in the United States might cost around $20-30 per person.\n\nThe high cost of living in Bermuda is also due to the fact that many goods have to be imported, which increases their cost. Additionally, the territory has a high standard of living, with a strong emphasis on quality and luxury, which also drives up prices. Overall, Bermuda is a very expensive destination, and visitors and residents should be prepared for high prices.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $100-200 | basic amenities, shared rooms |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $250-400 | comfortable rooms, standard amenities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $500-1000 | high-end amenities, beachfront locations |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $2,000-4,000 | city center, 1-2 bedrooms |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $1,500-3,000 | outside city center, 1-2 bedrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-20 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-40 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $50-100 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $8-12 |\n| Coffee | $5-10 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $3-5 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $3-5 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $5-10 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 1,500 | 2,500 | 4,000 |\n| Food | 500 | 1,000 | 1,500 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 150 | 250 | 350 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 500 | 1,000 |\n| **Total** | **2,450** | **4,450** | **7,150** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting Bermuda during the off-season (April-May or September-October) to take advantage of lower prices for accommodation and flights.\n- Look for apartments or houses outside of the city center to reduce rent costs.\n- Use public transportation instead of taxis to get around the island.\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls instead of mid-range or fine dining restaurants.\n- Take advantage of free activities such as visiting the beach or exploring the island's natural beauty.\n- Shop at local markets or grocery stores instead of tourist-oriented shops to reduce food and souvenir costs.",
