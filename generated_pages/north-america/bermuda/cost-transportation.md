[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Bermuda is a small island territory with a well-developed public transportation system, making it easy to get around without a car. The main modes of transportation are buses and taxis, with ferries also available for traveling to nearby islands. The quality of public transit is good, with frequent bus services and a comprehensive network of routes covering most areas of the island. Most people get around by bus or taxi, as the island is relatively small and traffic is generally light.

The island's compact size and scenic roads also make it a popular destination for cyclists and pedestrians, with many bike rental shops and walking trails available. However, the lack of ride-hailing services and limited taxi availability can make it difficult to get around at night or in rural areas. Additionally, the island's narrow roads and limited parking can make driving a challenge, especially for visitors.
