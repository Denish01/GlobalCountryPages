The cost of utilities in Bermuda is generally stable, but can fluctuate due to seasonal variations in demand. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the summer months when air conditioning usage is more prevalent. The Bermuda Government regulates utility prices to ensure they remain reasonable and affordable for residents. The high **GDP per capita** of $124,253 and relatively low **education spend** of 1.9% of GDP may contribute to the overall high cost of living in Bermuda, including utility costs.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Bermuda is generally high, with a focus on reliability and customer service. The island's small size and relatively low population density make it easier to maintain and upgrade utility infrastructure, which helps to keep costs under control. However, the cost of utilities in Bermuda is still relatively high compared to other countries, due in part to the island's remote location and reliance on imported fuel.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $100 | $150 | $200 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | not commonly used in Bermuda |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $20 | $30 | $40 | included in municipal taxes |\n| **Total** | **$140** | **$210** | **$280** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $60-80 | 10-20 Mbps | Bermuda CableVision, Logic |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 50-100 Mbps | Bermuda CableVision, Logic |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $20-30 | 5-10 GB | Digicel, One Communications |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-50 | 10-20 GB | Digicel, One Communications |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | Bermuda CableVision, Logic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $15 | Bermuda-based streaming service |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Bermuda, residents typically need to contact the relevant service provider and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but may not offer the same level of convenience as postpaid plans.\n- The best internet providers in Bermuda are Bermuda CableVision and Logic, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or walking or cycling instead of driving.",
