The GDP per capita PPP of $124,253 is one of the highest globally, indicating a strong economy with a high standard of living. However, this also means that the cost of living is correspondingly high, making it challenging for people with limited budgets to afford the basic necessities. A budget of $4,500 per month would allow for a modest lifestyle, while $6,500 per month would provide a mid-range lifestyle with some comforts. A comfortable lifestyle would require around $9,000 per month. Compared to neighboring countries, Bermuda is significantly more expensive than the United States, with prices for food, housing, and transportation being substantially higher.\n\nThe high cost of living in Bermuda is due to several factors, including its remote location, limited land area, and high demand for goods and services. The island's economy is heavily reliant on tourism and financial services, which drives up the cost of living. Additionally, the government imposes high taxes on goods and services, which further contributes to the high cost of living. Despite these challenges, Bermuda remains a popular destination for tourists and expats, who are drawn to its beautiful beaches, mild climate, and high standard of living.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 1,800 | 2,800 | 4,500 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 800 | 1,200 | 2,000 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 200 | 400 | 600 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 150 | 250 | 350 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 100 | 200 | 500 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 300 | 600 | 1,200 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 200 | 400 | 800 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 500 | 1,000 | 2,000 | |\n| **Total** | **4,250** | **6,550** | **9,050** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nAt the budget level of $4,500 per month, daily life in Bermuda would be quite modest.
