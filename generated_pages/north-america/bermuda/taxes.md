[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Bermuda has a **territorial tax system**, meaning that only income earned within the country is subject to tax. This is in contrast to a worldwide tax system, where all income earned by residents is subject to tax, regardless of where it is earned. Bermuda's tax system is designed to attract foreign investment and talent to the island, and it has a number of incentives and exemptions to encourage businesses and individuals to set up operations there. The country's **residency rules** for tax purposes are based on the number of days spent in Bermuda, with individuals who spend more than 90 days in the country in a calendar year considered residents for tax purposes.

Bermuda's tax system is also characterized by a lack of **taxation on income**, with no income tax, payroll tax, or wealth tax levied on residents. This makes it an attractive destination for high-net-worth individuals and businesses looking to minimize their tax liability. However, the country does have a number of other taxes and fees, including a **payroll tax** that is levied on employers, and a **land tax** that is levied on property owners. The government also generates revenue from **customs duties** and **excise taxes** on imported goods.

[SECTION] Personal Income Tax [/SECTION]
Since Bermuda has no income tax, there are no **income tax brackets** or **tax rates** to report. However, individuals who are considered residents for tax purposes may still be required to file a tax return, even if they have no taxable income. The tax authority in Bermuda, the **Bermuda Tax Authority**, provides guidance on the filing requirements and any necessary forms or documentation.
| Income Bracket (BMD) | Tax Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 0 - 100,000 | 0% |
| 100,001 - 200,000 | 0% |
| 200,001 - 500,000 | 0% |
| 500,001 and above | 0% |

Individuals who are considered residents for tax purposes may be eligible for certain **deductions and allowances**, such as a deduction for mortgage interest or charitable donations.
