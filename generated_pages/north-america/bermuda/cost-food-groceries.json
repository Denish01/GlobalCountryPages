  "content": "Food prices in Bermuda are relatively high due to the island's remote location and reliance on imports, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant costing around $20-$30 USD per person. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($20-$30 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($60-$100 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($800-$1,200 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($8-$12 USD)\nCurrency: BMD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nBermuda's food prices are significantly higher than the regional average, primarily due to the island's reliance on imports and limited local production. The cost of living in Bermuda is driven up by the high cost of transportation, storage, and labor, which are factored into the prices of food and other goods. As a result, eating out can be expensive, with mid-range restaurants charging around $60-$100 USD for a meal for two. However, the local cuisine is a unique blend of British, African, and Caribbean influences, making it a worthwhile experience for visitors. In contrast, home cooking can be a more affordable option, with a monthly grocery budget for one person ranging from $800 to $1,200 USD.\n\nThe eating-out culture in Bermuda is vibrant, with many restaurants offering a range of cuisines, from traditional Bermudian dishes like fish sandwiches and codfish cakes to international flavors. However, the high prices can make it challenging for budget-conscious travelers to dine out frequently. To make the most of their culinary experience, visitors can opt for lunch specials, happy hour deals, or street food vendors, which offer more affordable options. Additionally, many restaurants offer outdoor seating areas, taking advantage of the island's pleasant climate and scenic views.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $3-$5 | 2.50-4.20 BMD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $4-$6 | 3.30-5.00 BMD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $4-$6 | 3.30-5.00 BMD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2-$4 | 1.65-3.30 BMD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $10-$15 | 8.25-12.40 BMD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $15-$25 | 12.40-20.80 BMD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $6-$10 | 5.00-8.25 BMD | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $5-$8 | 4.15-6.60 BMD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $3-$5 | 2.50-4.20 BMD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $2-$4 | 1.65-3.30 BMD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $15-$25 | 12.40-20.80 BMD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-$4 | 1.65-3.30 BMD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$20 | (fish sandwiches, codfish cakes) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$40 | (one person, burger, salad) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $60-$100 | (3 courses, seafood, steak) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $150-$250 | (upscale, wine pairings) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $8-$12 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $10-$15 | |\n| Cappuccino | $5-$8 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $3-$5 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to grocery shopping, prices can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price point. In contrast, local markets and roadside vendors often sell fresh produce, meats, and dairy products at lower prices. However, the selection may be limited, and the quality can vary. To make the most of their shopping experience, visitors can opt for a combination of both, buying staples like milk, bread, and eggs at supermarkets, while exploring local markets for fresh produce and unique specialties.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be substantial, with some items costing up to 50% less at local vendors. For example, a dozen eggs may cost $4-$6 at a supermarket, while a local farmer may sell them for $2-$3. Similarly, fresh produce like tomatoes and apples can be found at lower prices at local markets. However, it's essential to note that bargaining is not a common practice in Bermuda, and prices are generally fixed. Visitors can still try negotiating, especially when buying in bulk or from local vendors, but it's crucial to be respectful and polite in their approach.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- **Fish sandwiches** are a local staple and can be found at affordable prices ($10-$15 USD) at many restaurants and food vendors.\n- Buying **fresh produce** at local markets can be a cost-effective way to stock up on fruits and vegetables.\n- **Codfish cakes** are another popular local dish, often served with peas and rice, and can be found at mid-range restaurants for around $20-$30 USD.\n- **Rum swizzle**, a classic Bermudian cocktail, can be made at home with local rum, fruit juices, and ginger beer, saving money on expensive bar prices.\n- Avoid buying **imported meats** and **dairy products**, which can be expensive due to high transportation costs, and opt for local alternatives instead.\n- **Street food vendors** often offer affordable and delicious options, such as grilled fish, chicken, and vegetables, for around $10-$15 USD per serving.",
