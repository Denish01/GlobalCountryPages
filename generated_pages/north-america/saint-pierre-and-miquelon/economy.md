Saint Pierre and Miquelon has a high-income economy, driven primarily by its fishing industry, which provides a significant portion of the territory's revenue. The economy is also supported by tourism, with visitors drawn to the islands' unique culture and natural beauty. As a territory of France, Saint Pierre and Miquelon receives significant financial support from the French government, which helps to maintain a high standard of living for its residents. The economy is relatively small, with a GDP of approximately $0.215 billion, and a GDP per capita of $36,917, indicating a high level of economic development.

The territory's economy is also characterized by a high level of dependence on imports, with most goods being shipped from France or other countries.
