The rental market is dominated by short-term leases, typically ranging from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by French law, which applies in the territory. Compared to regional neighbors like Canada, Saint Pierre and Miquelon's housing costs are relatively high, due to the territory's remote location and limited economy. However, the cost of living in Saint Pierre and Miquelon is still lower than in major Canadian cities like Montreal or Toronto.\n\nThe housing market in Saint Pierre and Miquelon is also influenced by the territory's small size and limited population. The demand for housing is relatively low, which can make it easier for renters to find accommodation. However, the supply of affordable housing is limited, and prices can be high, especially in the city center. The territory's government has implemented measures to control rent prices and provide assistance to low-income families, but the housing market remains relatively expensive.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $700-$900 | $500-$700 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | $900-$1,200 | $600-$900 | typical quality, 1-2 bedrooms |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $900-$1,400 | family size, 2-3 bedrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,400-$2,000 | spacious, 3-4 bedrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$3,500 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,800-$2,800 | residential areas, lower demand |\n| Rural | $1,000-$1,800 | limited availability, lower prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Saint-Pierre Downtown**: $800-$1,200 USD per month, central location, close to amenities\n- **Anse-à-Henry**: $600-$1,000 USD per month, residential area, family-friendly\n- **Cap-aux-Marins**: $500-$900 USD per month, coastal location, scenic views\n- **Pointe-au-Gel**: $400-$800 USD per month, rural area, peaceful surroundings\n- **Miquelon-Langlade**: $300-$600 USD per month, rural area, limited amenities\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Saint Pierre and Miquelon [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and prices before starting your search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find accommodation\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market can be competitive\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms, if possible\n- Check the condition of the property and ensure it is well-maintained before signing a lease\n- Consider purchasing furniture and appliances, as unfurnished apartments are common\n- Be aware of scams and always sign a written lease agreement\n- Utilities, such as electricity and water, are usually not included in the rent\n- [CALLOUT] Be sure to read and understand the lease agreement before signing, as it may be written in French.",
