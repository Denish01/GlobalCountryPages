The main modes of transportation are walking, cycling, and driving, with some public transportation available. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with regular bus services connecting the main towns and villages. However, the lack of a large population and limited infrastructure means that options can be limited, especially outside of the capital, Saint-Pierre.\n\nMost people get around Saint Pierre and Miquelon by car, with many residents owning their own vehicles. The island's small size and limited traffic make it easy to navigate, and parking is generally not a problem. However, the lack of public transportation options can make it difficult for visitors to get around without a car. There are some taxi services available, but these can be expensive, especially for longer journeys.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $60 | Good coverage of main towns and villages |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly connecting outlying villages to Saint-Pierre |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$20 | Limited availability, especially outside Saint-Pierre |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Saint-Pierre city center, by taxi or private transfer |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | Prices can vary depending on global oil prices |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.40 | Prices can vary depending on global oil prices |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, prices vary depending on rental company and season |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options, but generally not a problem |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, no toll roads on the island |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$30 | Limited routes, mainly connecting Saint-Pierre to outlying villages |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | To nearby Canadian islands, or to mainland France via connecting flights |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider renting a car to get around the island, as public transportation options can be limited.\n- Be prepared for variable weather conditions, especially when driving, as the island can be prone to fog and strong winds.\n- Use taxi services sparingly, as they can be expensive, especially for longer journeys.\n- Walk or cycle whenever possible, as the island is small and scenic, and this can be a great way to explore.\n- Book flights and car rentals in advance to avoid high prices and limited availability, especially during peak season.\n- Download maps and guides to help navigate the island, as **GPS** and **internet** coverage can be limited in some areas.",
