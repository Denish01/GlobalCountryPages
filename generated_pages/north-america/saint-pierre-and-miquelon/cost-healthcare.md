The healthcare system in Saint Pierre and Miquelon is primarily public, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical centers providing comprehensive care to locals and visitors. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, as a foreigner, you may face language barriers and limited access to certain specialized services. Locals are covered by the French social security system, which provides universal healthcare coverage. Foreigners, on the other hand, are advised to have private health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as the public system may not cover all costs.

However, foreigners may be required to pay out-of-pocket for certain services, which can be expensive.
