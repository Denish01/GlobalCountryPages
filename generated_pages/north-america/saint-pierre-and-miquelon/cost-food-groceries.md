[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The cost of food in Saint Pierre and Miquelon is significantly influenced by the territory's remote location and limited access to local produce. As a result, many food items are imported from France or Canada, which drives up prices. Despite the high costs, eating out is a popular activity in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, with many restaurants serving French-inspired cuisine. However, home cooking is also common, and many residents opt to buy groceries and prepare meals at home to save money. The territory's eating-out culture is largely centered around mid-range restaurants, which offer a range of dishes at moderate prices.
