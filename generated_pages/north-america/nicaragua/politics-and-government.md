[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Nicaragua is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the Head of State and Head of Government. The President is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is limited to two consecutive terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Assembly, which has 92 seats. Members of the National Assembly are elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the land.

The system of government in Nicaragua is characterized by a strong **presidential system**, where the President has significant powers and influence over the other branches of government. The National Assembly has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto them. The Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution and laws, but its independence has been questioned in recent years.

The **separation of powers** in Nicaragua is not always clear-cut, with the executive branch often exerting significant influence over the other branches. This has led to concerns about the **rule of law** and the **independence of the judiciary**. Despite these challenges, Nicaragua has made significant progress in recent years in terms of economic development and poverty reduction.
