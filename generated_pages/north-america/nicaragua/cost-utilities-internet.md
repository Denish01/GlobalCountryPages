[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Nicaragua's utility infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation services. However, the quality of these services can still vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better infrastructure than rural areas. The costs of utilities in Nicaragua can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity during the dry season (December to May) and higher water usage during the rainy season (June to November). Additionally, the inflation rate of 4.6% in 2024 may also impact the costs of utilities, with prices potentially increasing over time.

The country's economy, with a GDP per capita PPP of $8,709 in 2024, has a relatively low cost of living compared to other countries in the region. However, the out-of-pocket health spend of 37.6% in 2023 and education spend of 2.9% of GDP in 2023 may indicate that households have limited disposable income to allocate to utility bills. As a result, many Nicaraguans may opt for prepaid electricity and other utility services to better manage their expenses.
