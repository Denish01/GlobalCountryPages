[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Nicaragua is easily accessible by air, with the Augusto C. Sandino International Airport (MGA) in Managua being the main entry point. This airport receives direct flights from major hubs in the United States, such as Miami and Houston, as well as from other Central American countries. You can also enter Nicaragua overland from its neighboring countries, Honduras and Costa Rica, via several border crossings, including the ones at Las Manos, El Espino, and Peñas Blancas. These border crossings are generally open from early morning to late evening, and the process is relatively straightforward, although it may require some patience.

If you're planning to enter Nicaragua by land, it's essential to research the current border crossing requirements and any necessary documentation, such as a valid passport, visa (if required), and proof of onward travel. Additionally, consider the time of year and potential delays due to weather or road conditions. For example, during the rainy season, some border crossings may be closed due to flooding or landslides. It's also a good idea to have a basic understanding of Spanish, as English may not be widely spoken at the border crossings.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Nicaragua has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating within the country. The main domestic airline is La Costeña, which offers flights from Managua to several destinations, including Bluefields, Corn Island, and Puerto Cabezas. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as the availability of seats can be limited. The cost of domestic flights can range from $100 to $300 USD, depending on the route and time of year. You can book domestic flights online through the airline's website or through a local travel agency.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Nicaragua does not have a functioning rail network, so train travel is not an option within the country. However, there are plans to revive the rail network in the future, which could potentially provide a scenic and convenient way to travel through the country. For now, other modes of transportation, such as buses and taxis, are the primary ways to get around.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Nicaragua has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect major cities and towns. The main bus companies, such as Ormeño and Tica Bus, offer a range of services, from economy to first-class, with varying levels of comfort and amenities. The cost of bus travel can range from $5 to $20 USD, depending on the route and class of service. Bus travel can be a convenient and affordable way to see the country, but be prepared for potentially long journeys and rough road conditions.
