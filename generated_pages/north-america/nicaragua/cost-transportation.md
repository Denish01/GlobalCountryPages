[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Nicaragua has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with a lack of efficient public transportation options in many areas. However, the country has a well-developed network of buses and **colectivos** (shared taxis) that connect major cities and towns. Most people in Nicaragua get around by using these buses and colectivos, as well as by walking or cycling. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Managua having a more comprehensive system than other cities.

In general, the transportation system in Nicaragua is relatively affordable, with most trips costing between $1-$5 USD. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system can make it difficult for tourists and locals alike to get around, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the country's roads can be in poor condition, especially during the rainy season, which can make travel times longer and more unpredictable.
