[SECTION] How Nicaragua Is Divided [/SECTION]
Nicaragua is divided into 15 departments and 2 autonomous regions, which are further subdivided into municipalities. The departments are similar to provinces or states, and they are responsible for providing various public services to their residents. The autonomous regions, on the other hand, have a greater degree of autonomy and are responsible for managing their own natural resources and providing services to their indigenous communities. This administrative structure allows for a balance between central government control and regional autonomy, which is essential for a country with a diverse geography and population.

The departments and autonomous regions of Nicaragua are diverse in terms of their geography, economy, and culture. The Pacific coastal departments, such as Managua and León, are the most populous and economically developed, while the Atlantic coastal departments, such as Bluefields and North Caribbean Coast, are less developed and have a stronger indigenous and Afro-Caribbean influence. The autonomous regions, which are located on the Atlantic coast, have a unique cultural identity and are home to several indigenous groups.
