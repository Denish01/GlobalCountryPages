        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Nicaragua has a lower-middle-income economy, with a mix of traditional and modern sectors. The country's economic development has been hindered by various challenges, including political instability, corruption, and a lack of investment in key sectors. Despite these challenges, Nicaragua has made progress in recent years, with a growing economy and a decline in poverty rates. The country's economy is driven primarily by the services sector, which accounts for approximately 55% of GDP, followed by industry (25%) and agriculture (20%).</p>
        <p>Nicaragua's economic trajectory has been influenced by its geographic location, with the country serving as a bridge between North and South America. The country has also been a member of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) since 2006, which has provided access to new markets and investment opportunities. However, the country's economic growth has been slowed by a lack of competitiveness, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled labor.</p>
        <p>The Nicaraguan government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including investments in infrastructure, tourism, and renewable energy. The country has also made efforts to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing the manufacturing and services sectors. Despite these efforts, Nicaragua's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in international trade policies.</p>

Despite these efforts, Nicaragua's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in international trade policies. The country's economic outlook is closely tied to the performance of the global economy, and the government will need to remain flexible and adaptable in order to respond to changing economic conditions.</p>
