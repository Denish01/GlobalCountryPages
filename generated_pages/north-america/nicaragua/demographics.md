[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Nicaragua's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in Central America, but it has been experiencing steady growth over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, which is slightly higher than the average for the region. This growth can be attributed to a combination of factors, including improvements in healthcare, increases in life expectancy, and a relatively high fertility rate. The urban population accounts for around 59.3% of the total population, with many people migrating to cities such as Managua, Leon, and Granada in search of better economic opportunities. However, this urbanization trend has also put a strain on the country's infrastructure and resources.

Nicaragua's population has also been affected by migration patterns, with many people leaving the country in search of work or fleeing from conflict and poverty. According to estimates, around 15% of the population lives abroad, with many Nicaraguans migrating to countries such as Costa Rica, the United States, and Spain. This has resulted in a significant loss of skilled workers and a decline in the country's economic growth. On the other hand, remittances sent back by Nicaraguans living abroad have become an important source of income for many families.

The population of Nicaragua is relatively young, with a median age of 23.5 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is in the workforce or dependent on others for support. The government has implemented various policies to address these challenges, including investments in education, healthcare, and job creation programs. However, more needs to be done to address the country's poverty and inequality issues, which affect a significant proportion of the population.
