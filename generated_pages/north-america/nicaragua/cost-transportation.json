However, the country has a well-developed network of buses and **colectivos** (shared taxis) that connect major cities and towns. Most people in Nicaragua get around by using these buses and colectivos, as well as by walking or cycling. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Managua having a more comprehensive system than other cities.\n\nIn general, the transportation system in Nicaragua is relatively affordable, with most trips costing between $1-$5 USD. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system can make it difficult for tourists and locals alike to get around, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the country's roads can be in poor condition, especially during the rainy season, which can make travel times longer and more unpredictable.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage in smaller cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$3 | N/A | Connects major cities and towns |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-$2 | $0.50-$1 | $3-$5 | Not always available |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$3 | $0.50-$1 | $5-$10 | Uber, Cabify available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Managua city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, unlimited mileage |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in major cities |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, mostly near Managua |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $5-$10 | Connects major cities, frequent departures |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes, mostly to Bluefields and Puerto Cabezas |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using buses and colectivos instead of taxis or ride-hailing apps.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure a safe and reliable ride.\n- Always negotiate the fare before getting into a taxi, especially if the meter is not working.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded buses and markets.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or for traveling to rural areas, but be aware of the poor road conditions and limited parking options.\n- Use apps like Moovit or Google Maps to plan your route and navigate the transportation system in Nicaragua.",
