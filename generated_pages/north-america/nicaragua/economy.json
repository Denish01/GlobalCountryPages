The country's economic development has been hindered by various challenges, including political instability, corruption, and a lack of investment in key sectors. Despite these challenges, Nicaragua has made progress in recent years, with a growing economy and a decline in poverty rates. The country's economy is driven primarily by the services sector, which accounts for approximately 55% of GDP, followed by industry (25%) and agriculture (20%).\n\nNicaragua's economic trajectory has been influenced by its geographic location, with the country serving as a bridge between North and South America. The country has also been a member of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) since 2006, which has provided access to new markets and investment opportunities. However, the country's economic growth has been slowed by a lack of competitiveness, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled labor.\n\nThe Nicaraguan government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including investments in infrastructure, tourism, and renewable energy. The country has also made efforts to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing the manufacturing and services sectors. Despite these efforts, Nicaragua's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in international trade policies.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Coffee, sugarcane, and bananas are major crops, with a growing focus on organic and specialty products |\n| Manufacturing | 15% of GDP | Textiles, food processing, and construction materials are key sectors, with a growing focus on exports |\n| Services | 55% of GDP | Tourism, finance, and trade are major contributors, with a growing focus on business process outsourcing |\n| Mining | 2% of GDP | Gold, silver, and copper are extracted, with a growing focus on responsible and sustainable mining practices |\n| Tourism | 5% of GDP | Ecotourism, cultural tourism, and adventure tourism are key sectors, with a growing focus on sustainable tourism practices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Coffee, with a focus on specialty and organic products\n- Textiles, including clothing and fabric\n- Sugarcane, with a growing focus on ethanol production\n- Bananas, with a focus on export markets in the United States and Europe\n- Gold, with a growing focus on responsible and sustainable mining practices\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- Petroleum products, including gasoline and diesel\n- Machinery, including construction equipment and vehicles\n- Electronics, including computers and telecommunications equipment\n- Food products, including grains and livestock\n- Chemicals, including fertilizers and pesticides\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- United States, with a focus on trade agreements and export markets\n- Costa Rica, with a focus on regional trade and economic integration\n- Honduras, with a focus on regional trade and economic cooperation\n- China, with a growing focus on trade and investment\n- Mexico, with a focus on regional trade and economic cooperation\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country's transport network includes over 20,000 kilometers of roads, with a focus on improving road quality and safety\n- Nicaragua has a growing energy sector, with a focus on renewable energy sources such as wind and geothermal power\n- Internet penetration is approximately 30%, with a growing focus on expanding access to rural areas\n- Mobile phone penetration is over 100%, with a growing focus on mobile banking and financial services\n- The country has several major ports, including the Port of Corinto and the Port of Bluefields, with a focus on expanding trade and economic cooperation\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nNicaragua's economic outlook is uncertain, with a range of challenges and opportunities on the horizon.
