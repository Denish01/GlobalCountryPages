  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Nicaragua can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $100 to $200 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($150 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($40 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($15 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.20 per kWh)\nCurrency: NIO\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nNicaragua's utility infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation services. However, the quality of these services can still vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better infrastructure than rural areas. The costs of utilities in Nicaragua can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity during the dry season (December to May) and higher water usage during the rainy season (June to November). Additionally, the inflation rate of 4.6% in 2024 may also impact the costs of utilities, with prices potentially increasing over time.\n\nThe country's economy, with a GDP per capita PPP of $8,709 in 2024, has a relatively low cost of living compared to other countries in the region. However, the out-of-pocket health spend of 37.6% in 2023 and education spend of 2.9% of GDP in 2023 may indicate that households have limited disposable income to allocate to utility bills. As a result, many Nicaraguans may opt for prepaid electricity and other utility services to better manage their expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $80 | prepaid options available |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | bottled gas, no piped gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | included in municipal tax |\n| **Total** | **$55** | **$95** | **$145** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Claro, Movistar |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 60 Mbps | Claro, Movistar |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Claro, Movistar, Tigo |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | Claro, Movistar, Tigo |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Claro, Movistar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | available in Spanish and English |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Spanish and English |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | limited content, Spanish only |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to visit the provider's office in person, with a valid ID and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity can be a cost-effective option for many households, as it allows for better budgeting and control over usage.\n- Claro and Movistar are two of the most popular internet providers in Nicaragua, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or carpooling.\n- It is also a good idea to negotiate with providers for the best rates, especially for long-term contracts or bundled services.",
