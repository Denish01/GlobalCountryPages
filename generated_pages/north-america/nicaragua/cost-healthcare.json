  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Nicaragua can vary significantly depending on the type of service, location, and whether you choose public or private healthcare, with an average health expenditure per capita of $217.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $217 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 37.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 118\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: NIO\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nNicaragua's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and long waiting times, while private healthcare is often more expensive but offers better facilities and more specialized care. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those with the means may opt for private healthcare. Having health insurance is recommended, as it can help to cover the cost of medical care, particularly in private facilities.\n\nThe healthcare system in Nicaragua is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. However, the system is often underfunded and understaffed, which can lead to shortages of medical supplies and equipment. In addition, the public healthcare system is often overcrowded, which can result in long waiting times for patients. Despite these challenges, there are some good quality private hospitals and clinics in Nicaragua, particularly in the capital city of Managua, which offer a range of specialized services, including surgery, cardiology, and oncology.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by location and dentist's qualifications |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by location and optometrist's qualifications |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by laboratory and test type |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of accommodation |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Prices vary by type of surgery and surgeon's experience |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Prices vary by hospital and obstetrician's experience |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Specialist consultations, surgery, diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Worldwide coverage, emergency evacuation, repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available in pharmacies and can cost between $5-$10.\n- Prescription medications can be more expensive, with prices ranging from $10-$50.\n- Pharmacies are readily available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may require a prescription from a doctor.\n- Some medications may be subsidized by the government, particularly for chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\n- It is recommended to bring any prescription medications with you when traveling to Nicaragua, as they may not be available locally.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 118 or seek immediate attention at a hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not be reliable in all areas. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private facilities, which offer better quality care and more specialized services. Some of the best hospitals in Nicaragua include the Hospital Metropolitano Vivian Pellas in Managua and the Hospital Escuela Oscar Danilo Rosales Arguello in Leon. It is also recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuation, particularly if you are traveling to rural areas or engaging in high-risk activities.\n\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to stay calm and seek help as quickly as possible. If you are in a rural area, it may be necessary to travel to a larger city or town to receive medical attention. It is also a good idea to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including your insurance provider and the embassy or consulate of your home country. Additionally, it is recommended to learn some basic Spanish phrases, such as \"Ayuda\" (help) and \"Hospital\" (hospital), which can help you to communicate with medical personnel and receive the care you need.",
