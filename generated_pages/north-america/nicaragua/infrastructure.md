# Nicaragua Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Nicaragua's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and ongoing efforts to upgrade and expand its transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 82% of population
Internet Penetration: 27%
Road Network: 23,897 km, with 2,300 km paved
Rail Network: 6 km, largely inactive
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 3, including the major port of Corinto
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Nicaragua's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with significant gaps in rural areas. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's transportation network, including the construction of new highways and the renovation of existing roads. However, much of the country's infrastructure is still in need of repair or replacement, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation is limited. The urban-rural gap is significant, with cities like Managua and León enjoying relatively modern infrastructure, while rural areas often lack access to basic services.

The government has made efforts to address these disparities, with investments in new infrastructure projects and programs aimed at expanding access to basic services. However, progress has been slow, and the country still faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure development. Despite these challenges, Nicaragua has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as electricity access and internet penetration.

Nicaragua's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to the country's transportation and energy networks. The country is working to improve its disaster preparedness and response capabilities, with investments in new emergency response systems and infrastructure designed to withstand natural disasters.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- Nicaragua's power generation mix is dominated by **fossil fuels**, with a growing contribution from **renewable energy** sources such as wind and geothermal power.
- The country has made significant progress in expanding access to electricity, with 82% of the population now connected to the grid.
- However, the electricity network is still prone to **outages** and **power cuts**, particularly during periods of high demand or when there are technical problems with the grid.
- Nicaragua is working to diversify its energy mix and reduce its dependence on imported fuels, with investments in new renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs.
- The government has set a target of generating 90% of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2025, which will require significant investment in new energy infrastructure.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water safety** is a concern in Nicaragua, with many rural communities lacking access to safe and reliable drinking water.
- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many households lacking access to adequate sanitation facilities.
- Access to **water and sanitation** is a significant challenge in rural areas, where communities often rely on traditional sources such as wells and latrines.
- The government has made efforts to improve access to water and sanitation, with investments in new water treatment plants and sanitation infrastructure.
- However, much work remains to be done to address the significant disparities in access to these basic services, particularly in rural areas.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Nicaragua, with all major operators offering 4G services in urban areas.
- **Fiber and broadband** services are also available, although they are largely limited to urban areas.
- The government has launched initiatives to expand access to **4G and 5G** services, including investments in new telecommunications infrastructure.
- **Postal services** are available, although they are not always reliable or efficient.
- Nicaragua has made significant progress in expanding access to telecommunications services, with internet penetration increasing rapidly in recent years.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The government has launched a major **transportation infrastructure** program, which includes investments in new highways, bridges, and public transportation systems.
- Nicaragua is also working to expand its **energy generation capacity**, with investments in new renewable energy projects and upgrades to the existing grid.
- The **Nicaragua Canal** project, which aims to construct a new canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, is a major ongoing development project.
- The government has also launched initiatives to improve **access to water and sanitation**, including investments in new water treatment plants and sanitation infrastructure.
- International organizations such as the **World Bank** and the **Inter-American Development Bank** are providing funding and technical assistance for many of these development projects.
