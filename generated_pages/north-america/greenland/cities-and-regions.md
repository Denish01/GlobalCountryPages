[SECTION] How Greenland Is Divided [/SECTION]
Greenland's administrative structure is divided into five municipalities: Sermersooq, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qaasuitsup, and Avannaata. This system was implemented in 2018, replacing the previous system of four municipalities. Each municipality has its own council and is responsible for providing public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The municipalities also have a significant degree of autonomy, allowing them to make decisions on local matters.

The capital city, Nuuk, is the center of the country's government and administration. The Government of Greenland is responsible for areas such as foreign policy, defense, and justice, while the municipalities are responsible for providing public services and managing local affairs. This division of power allows for a balance between national and local interests, enabling Greenland to maintain its unique cultural identity while also addressing the needs of its diverse population.
