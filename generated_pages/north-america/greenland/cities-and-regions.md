[SECTION] How Greenland Is Divided [/SECTION]
Greenland's administrative structure is composed of five municipalities, which were established in 2009 as part of a decentralization effort. These municipalities are responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the national government handles matters such as foreign policy, defense, and economic development. The five municipalities are Sermersooq, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qaanaaq, and Avannaata, each with its own unique character and challenges.

The division of Greenland into municipalities has helped to promote local autonomy and self-governance, allowing each region to address its specific needs and priorities. For example, the municipality of Sermersooq, which includes the capital city of Nuuk, has a strong focus on education and economic development, while the municipality of Qaanaaq has a greater emphasis on traditional hunting and fishing practices. This decentralization has helped to promote economic growth and social development in Greenland, and has allowed the country to better address the challenges posed by its remote and rugged environment.

Dog sledding and snowmobiling are popular modes of transportation in the winter, while boat tours and kayaking are popular in the summer.

In the summer, boat tours and kayaking are popular ways to explore the coastline and surrounding islands, while in the winter, dog sledding and snowmobiling are popular modes of transportation. Visitors should be prepared for challenging driving conditions and limited infrastructure, and should plan ahead to ensure that they have the necessary transportation and accommodations.
