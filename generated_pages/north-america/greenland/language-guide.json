Greenlandic is the predominant language, spoken by the vast majority of the population, while Danish is widely used in official contexts, education, and business. There are several regional dialects of Greenlandic, including Kitaamiut, Tunumiit, and Inuktun, which may vary significantly from one another. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry, but it is not as widely spoken as in other European countries. Despite this, many Greenlanders, especially in the capital city of Nuuk, have a good command of English, making it possible for visitors to communicate and navigate the country with relative ease.\n\nThe use of **Greenlandic** is promoted by the government, and it is the primary language used in most official contexts, including education, media, and government services. However, **Danish** is still widely used, particularly in business and international communication. The country's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the presence of **Inuit** languages, which are spoken by the Inuit people, the indigenous inhabitants of Greenland. These languages are an essential part of Greenland's cultural heritage and are still spoken by many people, particularly in rural areas.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the use of **English** in Greenland, particularly in the tourism industry. Many hotels, restaurants, and tour operators have English-speaking staff, and some even offer English-language services and materials. However, it is still important for visitors to learn some basic **Greenlandic** phrases, as this can help to show respect for the local culture and people.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Baaj | Bah-ee | formal |\n| Hello | Haluu | Ha-loo | informal |\n| Thank you | Qujanaq | Koo-yah-nak |  |\n| Please | Takuss | Tah-kus |  |\n| Yes / No | Ii / Naamik | Ee / Nah-mik |  |\n| Excuse me | Unnu | Oon-oo |  |\n| How much? | Qassit? | Kah-see-t |  |\n| Where is...? | Sulinermik? | Soo-lee-ner-mik |  |\n| I don't understand | Naamik illit | Nah-mik il-it |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Oqaluttuutit anglisut? | Oh-ka-loo-too-it ang-li-sut |  |\n| Help! | Naalakkersuisut! | Nah-lah-ker-soo-it |  |\n| Goodbye | Baaj | Bah-ee | formal |\n| Sorry | Suna | Soo-nah |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ataaseq | Ah-tah-sek |\n| 2 | Marluk | Mah-rook |\n| 3 | Pingasut | Pee-ngah-soot |\n| 4 | Sisamat | See-sah-mat |\n| 5 | Tallimat | Tah-lee-mat |\n| 6 | Arfinngorneq | Ah-rin-goorn-ek |\n| 7 | Arfinngorneq marluk | Ah-rin-goorn-ek mah-rook |\n| 8 | Arfinngorneq pingasut | Ah-rin-goorn-ek pee-ngah-soot |\n| 9 | Arfinngorneq sisamat | Ah-rin-goorn-ek see-sah-mat |\n| 10 | Qulit | Koo-leet |\n| 100 | Hundred | Hoon-dreth |\n| 1000 | Tusint | Too-sint |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it is customary to use formal language, especially when addressing older people or those in positions of authority.\n- Direct eye contact is important in Greenlandic culture, as it shows respect and sincerity.\n- The use of **hand gestures** is generally limited, and it is considered impolite to point with the index finger.\n- When **asking for help**, it is best to approach someone who appears to be in a position of authority or who is clearly willing to assist.\n- In formal situations, it is customary to use **titles** such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" followed by the person's surname.\n- When **bargaining** or negotiating prices, it is essential to be respectful and polite, as aggressive behavior can be seen as impolite.\n- Learning a few basic **Greenlandic phrases** can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The **Google Translate** app can be a useful tool for communicating with locals, although it may not always provide accurate translations.\n- **Phrasebooks** and **language guides** can be purchased at bookstores or online, and they often include useful phrases and vocabulary.\n- **Language learning apps** such as Duolingo and Babbel can help visitors learn basic **Greenlandic** phrases and vocabulary.\n- The **Visit Greenland** website provides a range of useful information and resources for visitors, including language guides and cultural tips.\n- [CALLOUT] It is essential to note that while English is becoming more widely spoken in Greenland, it is still not as prevalent as in other European countries, and visitors should make an effort to learn some basic **Greenlandic** phrases to show respect for the local culture and people.",
