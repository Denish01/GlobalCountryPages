[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland is a vast and sparsely populated territory, with a diverse range of **climate zones**. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the Arctic, subarctic, and temperate zones. The Arctic zone, which covers most of the country, is characterized by long, cold winters and short, cool summers. The subarctic zone, which is found in the southern and western parts of the country, has milder winters and cooler summers. The temperate zone, which is limited to a small area in the southernmost part of the country, has mild winters and warm summers. Greenland does not have a distinct **dry** or **wet season**, but the summer months tend to be drier than the winter months. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Greenland, with the summer months offering the best conditions for hiking, camping, and boat tours, while the winter months are better suited for dog sledding, snowmobiling, and Northern Lights sightings.

The **summer solstice**, which occurs in June, marks the beginning of the summer season in Greenland. During this time, the days are long, with up to 24 hours of daylight in the northern parts of the country. The summer months are also the best time for **whale watching**, as the ice melts and the whales migrate to the coastal waters. The **winter solstice**, which occurs in December, marks the beginning of the winter season in Greenland. During this time, the days are short, with as little as 2 hours of daylight in the northern parts of the country. The winter months are the best time for **Northern Lights sightings**, as the clear skies and low humidity offer optimal viewing conditions.

The **transition periods** between the summer and winter seasons, which occur in April to May and September to October, offer a unique combination of winter and summer activities. During these periods, it is possible to go dog sledding, snowmobiling, or skiing in the morning, and then go hiking or kayaking in the afternoon. These periods are also the best time for **photography**, as the soft light and unique landscapes offer a wide range of creative possibilities.
