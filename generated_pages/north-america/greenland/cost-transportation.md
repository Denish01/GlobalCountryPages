[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Getting around in Greenland can be challenging due to its vast and remote geography. The main modes of transportation are by air, sea, and land, with a limited public transportation system. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with the capital city Nuuk having a more developed system than other parts of the country. Most people in Greenland get around by walking, cycling, or using private vehicles, as the public transportation system is limited and often unreliable.

The country's rugged terrain and harsh climate also make it difficult to maintain a comprehensive public transportation system. However, efforts are being made to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new airports and the expansion of existing ones. Additionally, many Greenlanders use **snowmobiles** and **dog sleds** as a means of transportation, especially in rural areas where roads are scarce.
