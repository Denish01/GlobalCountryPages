# Greenland Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

The culture of Greenland is a unique blend of traditional Inuit customs and modern Danish influences, shaped by the country's history, geography, and climate. 

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Greenland's culture is defined by its indigenous Inuit people, known as the **Kalaallit**, who have lived in the country for thousands of years. The Kalaallit have a strong tradition of whaling, hunting, and fishing, which has been passed down through generations. The country's cultural identity is also influenced by its history as a Danish colony, with many Greenlanders speaking Danish as a second language. The ethnic makeup of Greenland is predominantly Inuit, with a small minority of Danish and other European settlers. The linguistic makeup is also predominantly Greenlandic, also known as **Kalaallisut**, which is an Eskimo-Aleut language.

The Kalaallit have a rich cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on community and family. Traditional clothing, such as the **parka** and **kamik**, is still worn on special occasions, and the country is known for its vibrant **tattoo** art. The Kalaallit are also skilled craftsmen, with a tradition of making intricate **woodcarvings** and **ivory sculptures**. The country's cultural identity is also reflected in its music and dance, with traditional **drum dancing** and **throat singing** still performed today.

Despite the influence of modern Danish culture, the Kalaallit have managed to maintain their traditional way of life, with many communities still practicing subsistence hunting and fishing. However, the country is also facing the challenges of climate change, which is affecting the traditional hunting and fishing practices of the Kalaallit. As a result, the country is working to develop new industries, such as tourism and renewable energy, to support its economy and preserve its cultural heritage.
