# Greenland Visa & Entry Requirements

To enter Greenland, you will typically need a visa, unless you are a citizen of a country that has a visa-free arrangement or can obtain a visa on arrival, and it is essential to verify the specific requirements for your nationality with the official embassy or consulate of Greenland before traveling.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of certain countries allowed visa-free access for a specified period. As a territory of Denmark, Greenland's visa policy is closely tied to that of Denmark, and many countries that have visa-free access to Denmark also have similar arrangements with Greenland. However, it is crucial to note that Greenland has some specific requirements and restrictions, particularly regarding the duration of stay and the activities that can be undertaken. Citizens of around 90 countries, including the US, UK, and EU member states, can enter Greenland without a visa, but the length of stay and the purpose of the visit will determine the specific requirements.

The visa policy of Greenland aims to balance the need to facilitate tourism and economic development with the need to protect the country's unique and fragile environment. As a result, the rules and regulations regarding entry and stay in Greenland can be complex, and it is essential to familiarize yourself with the specific requirements for your nationality and the purpose of your visit. Greenland's visa policy is also influenced by its geographical location, with the country being part of the Nordic Passport Union, which allows for passport-free travel between Nordic countries.
