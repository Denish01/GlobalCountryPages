[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from certain countries eligible for visa-free access, while others require a visa or other travel documents. As a territory of Denmark, Greenland's visa policy is closely aligned with that of Denmark, but there are some exceptions and special requirements due to its unique location and limited infrastructure. Currently, citizens of around 90 countries can enter Greenland without a visa, but this is subject to change, and it is essential to check the latest requirements before planning your trip.

The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development in Greenland. The country has a relatively small population and a fragile environment, and the government is keen to ensure that visitors respect these factors and comply with local regulations. As a result, visa requirements and regulations can be strict, especially for certain nationalities or types of visitors.
