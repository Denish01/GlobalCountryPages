The majority of expats in Greenland are Danish citizens, as well as some from other Nordic countries, who are often employed in the public sector, healthcare, or education. The quality of life in Greenland is generally high, with modern amenities and services available in the larger towns, but it can be challenging due to the harsh Arctic climate, limited job opportunities, and high cost of living.\n\nDespite these challenges, many people find that the benefits of living in Greenland, including its breathtaking landscapes, vibrant cultural scene, and strong sense of community, outweigh the drawbacks. Expats in Greenland often comment on the friendly and welcoming nature of the local people, and the unique opportunities for outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, and dog sledding. However, it is essential to be well-prepared and flexible when moving to Greenland, as the country's remote location and limited infrastructure can make everyday tasks more complicated than in more urbanized countries.\n\nThe expat community in Greenland is relatively small, but it is active and supportive, with many social and cultural events organized throughout the year. Expats can also connect with each other through online forums and social media groups, which can be a valuable resource for sharing advice and experiences. Overall, moving to Greenland can be a rewarding and life-changing experience for those who are willing to adapt to its unique challenges and opportunities.\n\n[SECTION] Visa & Residency Options [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Visa Type | Duration | Requirements | Cost (USD) | Path to PR? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tourist | up to 90 days | valid passport, proof of onward travel | $0 | No |\n| Work Visa | up to 3 years | job offer, qualifications, language test | $300-$500 | Yes |\n| Business/Investor | up to 5 years | business plan, investment, language test | $1,000-$2,000 | Yes |\n| Retirement | up to 5 years | pension, health insurance, language test | $500-$1,000 | No |\n| Student | up to 2 years | admission letter, language test, health insurance | $200-$500 | No |\n| Digital Nomad | up to 1 year | proof of income, health insurance, language test | $200-$500 | No |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Relocation Checklist [/SECTION]\n1.
