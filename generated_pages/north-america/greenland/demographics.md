# Greenland Demographics — Population, Ethnicity & Religion

The population of Greenland is primarily composed of the **Inuit** people, with a small minority of Europeans, mainly of Danish descent, making up the rest of the population. 

[FACTBOX]
Total Population: 0.06 million
Population Growth Rate: 0.1%
Median Age: 34.1 years
Urban Population: 87.7%
Population Density: 0.026 per km2
Life Expectancy: 72.3 years
Fertility Rate: 1.9 children per woman
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The total population of Greenland is approximately 56,542 people, with a very low population density due to its vast territory. The population growth rate is relatively low, at 0.1%, which is attributed to a low fertility rate and limited migration. The majority of the population, around 87.7%, lives in urban areas, with the capital city Nuuk being the largest urban center. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 34.1 years. However, the population is expected to age in the coming years, which may pose challenges to the country's economy and social services.

The urbanization trend in Greenland is driven by the limited economic opportunities in rural areas, with many young people moving to urban centers in search of education and employment. However, this trend also poses challenges to the traditional way of life in rural areas, where many people rely on subsistence hunting and fishing. The government of Greenland has implemented policies to support rural development and preserve the traditional way of life, but more needs to be done to address the challenges faced by rural communities.

Greenland's population is also affected by migration patterns, with many young people leaving the country to pursue higher education or employment opportunities in Denmark or other countries. This brain drain poses a significant challenge to the country's economic development, as it leads to a shortage of skilled labor in key sectors such as healthcare and education. However, the government of Greenland has implemented policies to attract skilled labor from other countries, and to support the repatriation of Greenlanders who have studied or worked abroad.
