# The Truth About Greenland - History & Real Facts

Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, is often misunderstood due to its unique cultural, geographical, and historical context, which is distinct from the rest of North America.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Greenland was first inhabited by the **Inuit** around 2500 BCE, with the **Thule people** migrating from present-day Canada around 1000 CE. The **Viking** explorer Erik the Red established the first Norse settlement in Greenland in 985 CE, which lasted for about 500 years. In 1380, Greenland became part of the **Kalmar Union**, a union of Scandinavian countries, and later became a Danish colony in 1814. Greenland gained home rule from Denmark in 1979 and has been an autonomous territory since then, with the Danish government responsible for defense and foreign affairs.

The **Treaty of Kiel** in 1814 marked the beginning of Greenland's modern relationship with Denmark, with Denmark gaining control over the territory. In the 20th century, Greenland's economy and infrastructure developed significantly, with the **United States** playing a significant role in the territory's defense during World War II. Today, Greenland continues to navigate its relationship with Denmark and the rest of the world, with a focus on self-governance and economic development.

The **Inuit Ataqatigiit** party, which advocates for greater autonomy and eventual independence from Denmark, has been a significant force in Greenlandic politics since its founding in 1976. The party has been involved in several coalition governments and has played a key role in shaping Greenland's relationship with Denmark and the rest of the world.

Greenland's unique cultural and historical context is reflected in its **Norse** and **Inuit** heritage, with the territory's language, **Greenlandic**, being an official language alongside **Danish**. The territory's history and culture are also reflected in its traditional **whaling** and **fishing** practices, which continue to play an important role in the economy and identity of the Greenlandic people.
