# The Truth About Greenland - History & Real Facts

Greenland is often misunderstood, but the real story is that of a unique and culturally rich territory with a complex history, stunning geography, and a distinct identity shaped by its **Inuit** heritage and **Danish** influences.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Greenland has been inhabited by the **Inuit** people for over 4,500 years, with the first migrants arriving from present-day Canada. The **Viking** explorer Erik the Red established the first Norse settlement in Greenland in 985 AD, which lasted for about 500 years. In 1380, Greenland became part of the **Kalmar Union**, a confederation of Scandinavian countries, and later became a Danish colony in 1814. Greenland gained home rule from Denmark in 1979, with the **Home Rule Act**, and has since been self-governing in most domestic matters, while Denmark remains responsible for defense and foreign affairs.

The **Danish** colonization of Greenland had a significant impact on the territory's language, culture, and economy. The **Danish language** was introduced, and many Greenlanders learned to speak Danish as a second language. The **Lutheran Church** also played a significant role in Greenland, with many Greenlanders converting to Christianity. In 1953, Greenland's status was changed from a colony to an **integral part of Denmark**, which led to increased investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.

Greenland's path to self-governance has been gradual, with the **Home Rule Act** of 1979 marking a significant milestone. The act gave Greenland control over most domestic matters, including education, healthcare, and the economy. In 2009, the **Self-Government Act** came into effect, which transferred more powers from Denmark to Greenland, including control over law enforcement, the coast guard, and the courts. Today, Greenland continues to navigate its relationship with Denmark, seeking to balance its desire for independence with the need for economic support and cooperation.

The **Inuit** people have played a crucial role in shaping Greenland's history and culture. The **Inuit** are an indigenous people who have lived in the Arctic regions of Canada, Alaska, and Greenland for thousands of years. They have a rich cultural heritage, with a strong tradition of storytelling, music, and art. The **Inuit** language, also known as **Kalaallisut**, is the primary language spoken in Greenland, and is an important part of the country's identity.
