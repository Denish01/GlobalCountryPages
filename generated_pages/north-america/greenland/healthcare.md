[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all citizens and residents are covered by the public healthcare system. The system is funded through taxes and provides comprehensive coverage, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, due to the country's remote location, access to specialized care can be limited, and patients may need to be evacuated to Denmark or other countries for certain treatments. The quality of care in Greenland is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the healthcare system faces challenges such as limited resources, lack of specialized care, and difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical professionals.

The public healthcare system in Greenland is the primary provider of healthcare services, and there are no private hospitals or clinics. However, some private medical practices and clinics offer specialized services such as dental care and physiotherapy. In urban areas, such as Nuuk, access to healthcare is generally good, with several hospitals and clinics providing a range of services. In rural areas, however, access to healthcare can be more limited, with fewer medical facilities and personnel.

Overall, Greenland's healthcare system provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents, but access to specialized care can be limited due to the country's remote location. The system is well-organized, and medical professionals are well-trained, but the lack of specialized care and limited resources can be a challenge.
