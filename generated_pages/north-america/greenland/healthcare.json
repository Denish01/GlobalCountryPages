  "content": "Healthcare in Greenland is generally of high quality, with a well-organized public healthcare system that provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents, but access to specialized care can be limited due to the country's remote location.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: High\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nGreenland's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all citizens and residents are covered by the public healthcare system. The system is funded through taxes and provides comprehensive coverage, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, due to the country's remote location, access to specialized care can be limited, and patients may need to be evacuated to Denmark or other countries for certain treatments. The quality of care in Greenland is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the healthcare system faces challenges such as limited resources, lack of specialized care, and difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical professionals.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Greenland is the primary provider of healthcare services, and there are no private hospitals or clinics. However, some private medical practices and clinics offer specialized services such as dental care and physiotherapy. In urban areas, such as Nuuk, access to healthcare is generally good, with several hospitals and clinics providing a range of services. In rural areas, however, access to healthcare can be more limited, with fewer medical facilities and personnel.\n\nOverall, Greenland's healthcare system provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents, but access to specialized care can be limited due to the country's remote location. The system is well-organized, and medical professionals are well-trained, but the lack of specialized care and limited resources can be a challenge.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Queen Ingrid Hospital | Nuuk | General Hospital | Emergency, Surgery, Internal Medicine | Yes |\n| Ilulissat Hospital | Ilulissat | General Hospital | Emergency, Surgery, Internal Medicine | Limited |\n| Sisimiut Hospital | Sisimiut | General Hospital | Emergency, Surgery, Internal Medicine | Limited |\n| Tasiilaq Hospital | Tasiilaq | General Hospital | Emergency, Surgery, Internal Medicine | Limited |\n| Dronning Louise Hospital | Qaqortoq | General Hospital | Emergency, Surgery, Internal Medicine | Limited |\n| Nuuk Dental Clinic | Nuuk | Dental Clinic | Dental Care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **National Health Insurance** is available to all citizens and residents, providing comprehensive coverage for medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions.\n- **Private health insurance** is not necessary, but can provide additional coverage for services not included in the public healthcare system, such as dental care and physiotherapy.\n- **Expats** may be eligible for national health insurance if they are employed or self-employed in Greenland, but may also consider private health insurance to supplement their coverage.\n- **Costs** for healthcare services are generally low, with most services covered by the public healthcare system.\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for visitors to Greenland, as it can provide coverage for emergency medical evacuations and other unexpected medical expenses.\n- **Supplemental insurance** may be available for specific services, such as dental care or vision care, but is not necessary for most people.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are generally available at pharmacies in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available at pharmacies and some supermarkets.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, but may be limited due to the country's remote location.\n- **Costs** for medications are generally high, due to the cost of importing medications to Greenland.\n- **Prescription requirements** are similar to those in other countries, with a doctor's prescription required for most medications.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Greenland include **tetanus**, **diphtheria**, and **polio**.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include **hepatitis A**, **hepatitis B**, and **influenza**.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Greenland include **tuberculosis** and **influenza**.\n- **Water safety** is generally good, with safe drinking water available in most areas.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, with a low risk of foodborne illnesses.\n- **Insect-borne illnesses** such as **mosquito-borne diseases** are not a significant risk in Greenland.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Greenland, due to the country's remote location and limited access to specialized care.\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Greenland are not available, as the country is not a popular destination for medical tourism.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are available in Nuuk and other urban areas, but may not offer the same level of specialized care as hospitals in other countries.\n- **Cost savings** for medical tourism in Greenland are not significant, due to the high cost of travel and accommodation in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 112, which can be used to contact emergency services such as ambulances and fire departments.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with ambulances available in urban areas and some rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be contacted for emergency services, with hospitals available in Nuuk and other urban areas.\n- **Insurance claims** can be made through the national health insurance system or private health insurance providers.\n- **Emergency evacuations** may be necessary for serious medical conditions, with evacuations to Denmark or other countries available through air ambulance services.",
