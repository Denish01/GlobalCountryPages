The language of instruction is **Greenlandic**, but **Danish** is also widely used, especially in higher education. There are a few private and international schools in Greenland, mainly in the capital city of **Nuuk**, which offer alternative education options for expats and locals alike.

The quality of public education in Greenland is generally high, with a strong emphasis on **bilingual education** and **cultural preservation**.
