  "content": "The population of Greenland is primarily composed of the **Inuit** people, with a small minority of Europeans, mainly of Danish descent, making up the rest of the population. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 0.06 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.1%\nMedian Age: 34.1 years\nUrban Population: 87.7%\nPopulation Density: 0.026 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 72.3 years\nFertility Rate: 1.9 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe total population of Greenland is approximately 56,542 people, with a very low population density due to its vast territory. The population growth rate is relatively low, at 0.1%, which is attributed to a low fertility rate and limited migration. The majority of the population, around 87.7%, lives in urban areas, with the capital city Nuuk being the largest urban center. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 34.1 years. However, the population is expected to age in the coming years, which may pose challenges to the country's economy and social services.\n\nThe urbanization trend in Greenland is driven by the limited economic opportunities in rural areas, with many young people moving to urban centers in search of education and employment. However, this trend also poses challenges to the traditional way of life in rural areas, where many people rely on subsistence hunting and fishing. The government of Greenland has implemented policies to support rural development and preserve the traditional way of life, but more needs to be done to address the challenges faced by rural communities.\n\nGreenland's population is also affected by migration patterns, with many young people leaving the country to pursue higher education or employment opportunities in Denmark or other countries. This brain drain poses a significant challenge to the country's economic development, as it leads to a shortage of skilled labor in key sectors such as healthcare and education. However, the government of Greenland has implemented policies to attract skilled labor from other countries, and to support the repatriation of Greenlanders who have studied or worked abroad.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Inuit | 89% | Throughout Greenland | Also known as Kalaallit, they are the indigenous people of Greenland |\n| European (mainly Danish) | 7% | Mainly in urban areas | Many are descendants of Danish colonizers or have come to Greenland for work |\n| Other | 4% | Mainly in urban areas | Includes people of other European, Asian, and African descent |\n| Inupiat | 1% | Northern Greenland | A subgroup of the Inuit people, living in the northern part of the country |\n| Yupik | 1% | Southern Greenland | Another subgroup of the Inuit people, living in the southern part of the country |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Greenland are relatively homogeneous, with the Inuit people making up the vast majority of the population. The Inuit are divided into several subgroups, including the Inupiat and Yupik, who have distinct cultural and linguistic traditions. The European population, mainly of Danish descent, is a small but significant minority, and plays an important role in the country's economy and politics. There are also small communities of people of other European, Asian, and African descent, who have come to Greenland for work or education. Overall, Greenland is a culturally diverse country, with a strong sense of Inuit identity and a growing awareness of its cultural heritage.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Greenlandic** (also known as Kalaallisut) is the official language and the most widely spoken language in Greenland.\n- Danish is also an official language and is widely spoken, particularly in urban areas and among the European population.\n- English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among young people and those in the tourism industry.\n- Other languages spoken in Greenland include Inupiat and Yupik, which are dialects of the Greenlandic language.\n- There are also several endangered languages spoken in Greenland, including the East Greenlandic dialect, which is spoken by only a few hundred people.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lutheran | 96% | The majority of the population belongs to the Church of Denmark, which is a Lutheran church |\n| Other Christian | 2% | Includes other Protestant and Catholic denominations |\n| Non-religious | 1% | A small but growing number of people identify as non-religious |\n| Other | 1% | Includes people of other faiths, such as Islam and Buddhism |\n[/TABLE]\nThe majority of the population in Greenland is Lutheran, with a strong tradition of Christianity dating back to the 18th century. The Church of Denmark plays an important role in Greenlandic society, and many people attend church services regularly. However, there is also a growing number of people who identify as non-religious, particularly among young people. Greenland is a secular country, and there is freedom of religion for all citizens. The government supports the Church of Denmark, but also recognizes the rights of other faith communities to practice their religion freely.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 22% | A significant proportion of the population is under the age of 15, which poses challenges for education and childcare |\n| 15-24 | 16% | Many young people leave Greenland to pursue higher education or employment opportunities abroad |\n| 25-54 | 43% | This age group makes up the majority of the workforce and is critical to the country's economic development |\n| 55-64 | 12% | This age group is approaching retirement age, which may pose challenges for the pension system |\n| 65+ | 7% | The elderly population is relatively small, but is expected to grow in the coming years, posing challenges for healthcare and social services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- Nuuk is the capital and largest city, with a population of around 16,000 people.\n- Sisimiut is the second-largest city, with a population of around 5,500 people, and is a major fishing and tourism center.\n- Ilulissat is a popular tourist destination, known for its icefjord and whale watching opportunities.\n- Qaqortoq is a major urban center in southern Greenland, with a population of around 3,000 people.\n- The urban population is growing rapidly, with many young people moving to cities in search of education and employment opportunities.",
