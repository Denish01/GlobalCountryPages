[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Greenland has two main international airports, Kangerlussuaq Airport (SFJ) and Nuuk Airport (GOH), with connections to Iceland and Denmark. Direct flights to Kangerlussuaq are available from Reykjavik, Iceland, and Copenhagen, Denmark, while Nuuk has flights from Reykjavik and Ilulissat, a major town in western Greenland. There are no overland entry points to Greenland, as it is an island nation, and traveling by sea is possible but not common due to the harsh marine environment and limited port facilities.

The main entry points for travelers are through Kangerlussuaq Airport, which serves as a hub for domestic flights, and Nuuk Airport, which handles most international flights. From these airports, you can connect to other parts of the country using domestic airlines or take a boat to nearby towns and villages. It is essential to plan your trip carefully, as flights and boat schedules can be limited, especially during the winter months. Additionally, be prepared for potential delays due to weather conditions, which can be unpredictable in Greenland.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Air Iceland Connect and Air Greenland are the primary domestic airlines in Greenland, offering flights between major towns and villages. The main routes connect Kangerlussuaq to Nuuk, Ilulissat, and other major towns, while smaller planes serve more remote areas. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as seats can be limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $200 to $500 USD per person, depending on the route and time of year. It is also possible to book flights as part of a package tour, which can include accommodation and activities.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Greenland has no rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a railway system. The lack of trains is due to the country's rugged terrain, limited population, and harsh climate, which make it impractical to build and maintain a rail network. As a result, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as flights, boats, and dogsleds, to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are no intercity bus companies in Greenland, as the country's limited road network and harsh climate make it challenging to operate bus services. However, some towns and villages have local bus services, which can be used to get around. These buses are often small and may not run frequently, so it is essential to plan your itinerary carefully. Additionally, some tour operators offer bus tours, which can be a convenient way to see the sights, especially for travelers who prefer not to drive.
