The market is primarily driven by the local demand for housing, with a limited number of foreign buyers and investors. The current market conditions are stable, with a slow but steady increase in prices over the past few years. The price trajectory is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the growing economy and increasing demand for housing. Urban areas such as Nuuk and Sisimiut are the most popular, with a higher demand for apartments and houses. Rural areas, on the other hand, have a limited market, with most properties being used for hunting and fishing purposes.\n\nThe property market in Greenland is also influenced by the country's unique geography and climate. The harsh Arctic climate and limited accessibility make it challenging to build and maintain properties, which can drive up costs and limit the availability of certain types of properties. However, this also creates opportunities for unique and specialized properties, such as **log cabins** and **hunting lodges**, that cater to the country's outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nThe market is also affected by the country's relationship with Denmark, with many Danish citizens and companies investing in the Greenlandic property market. This has led to an increase in demand for properties, particularly in the capital city of Nuuk, and has driven up prices in recent years.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nuuk | $2,500 | $1,500 | Apartment |\n| Sisimiut | $2,000 | $1,200 | House |\n| Ilulissat | $1,800 | $1,000 | Apartment |\n| Qaqortoq | $1,500 | $900 | House |\n| Tasiilaq | $1,200 | $800 | Apartment |\n| Kangerlussuaq | $1,000 | $700 | House |\n| Upernavik | $800 | $600 | Apartment |\n| Ittoqqortoormiit | $600 | $500 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are restricted from buying property in Greenland, but can lease property for up to 30 years with the right permits and approvals.\n- Foreign companies can buy property, but must have a **Greenlandic-registered company** and obtain the necessary permits.\n- Foreigners can also buy property through a **leasehold agreement**, which allows them to use the property for a specified period of time.\n- Foreigners must obtain a **permit from the Greenlandic authorities** before buying or leasing property.\n- Foreigners must also comply with **Greenlandic building regulations** and **zoning laws** when building or renovating properties.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
