[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Greenland is characterized by a significant urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable connections available in the capital city of Nuuk and other major towns, while rural areas often struggle with slower speeds and limited coverage. The average internet speed in Greenland is around 10 Mbps download, which is relatively slow compared to other developed countries. However, the internet quality has been improving in recent years, with investments in new infrastructure and technology. Despite these improvements, the reliability of the internet can still be a issue, especially during peak hours or in areas with high usage.

The **mobile network coverage** in Greenland is moderate, with Tele Greenland, the state-owned telecommunications company, providing the most extensive coverage. However, even in areas with coverage, the signal strength can be weak, and data speeds may be slow. The limited internet availability and high costs can make it challenging for residents and visitors to stay connected, especially in rural areas where other services like healthcare and education may also be limited. As a result, it is essential to plan ahead and research the best options for staying connected, especially for those who need to work or study online.
