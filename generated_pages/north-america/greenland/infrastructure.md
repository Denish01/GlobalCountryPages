[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland's infrastructure development level is relatively low due to its remote location, harsh climate, and limited population. However, the country has made significant investments in recent years to improve its infrastructure, particularly in the areas of energy, transportation, and telecommunications. The urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development is significant, with the capital city of Nuuk having better access to amenities and services compared to rural areas. The government of Greenland has been working to address this gap through various development projects and initiatives.

The Danish government, as the parent country, provides significant financial support to Greenland, which has enabled the country to invest in its infrastructure. Additionally, the country has been exploring ways to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on fishing and hunting, which has led to investments in areas such as tourism and renewable energy. Despite these efforts, Greenland's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including the high cost of maintenance and operation due to the country's remote location and harsh climate.

Greenland's infrastructure development is also influenced by its unique cultural and environmental context. The country has a strong tradition of **subsistence hunting and fishing**, which requires a high degree of self-sufficiency and adaptability. As a result, the country's infrastructure development has focused on supporting these traditional activities, while also promoting economic development and modernization. For example, the government has invested in **renewable energy** projects, such as wind and hydro power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and promote sustainable development.

[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]
[TABLE]
| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roads | 150 km | Moderate | Mostly gravel roads, limited accessibility during winter months |
| Railways | 0 km | - | No rail network in Greenland |
| Airports | 2 international, 13 domestic | Good | Major airports in Nuuk and Kangerlussuaq, with regular flights to Denmark and Iceland |
| Ports | 13 major | Moderate | Major ports in Nuuk, Sisimiut, and Ilulissat, with regular shipping services to Denmark and other Arctic countries |
[/TABLE]
The transportation infrastructure in Greenland is limited, with no rail network and a limited road network. However, the country has a well-developed airport system, with regular flights to Denmark and other Arctic countries. The port system is also well-developed, with major ports in Nuuk, Sisimiut, and Ilulissat. The government has been working to improve the country's transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new airports and the upgrading of existing roads and ports.

- Greenland's power generation is mostly based on **hydroelectric power**, with several hydroelectric plants located throughout the country.
- The country has a high level of electricity access, with 100% of the population having access to electricity.
- However, the reliability of the electricity supply can be affected by the country's harsh climate, with frequent power outages during winter months.
- The government has been working to promote the development of **renewable energy** sources, including wind and solar power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
- Greenland has set a goal to become **carbon neutral** by 2030, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy production and transportation.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- Tap water in Greenland is generally safe to drink, with modern water treatment facilities in place.
- However, the country's water supply can be affected by the harsh climate, with frequent water shortages during winter months.
- Sanitation coverage is high, with most households having access to modern sanitation facilities.
- The government has been working to improve water access in rural areas, with the construction of new water treatment facilities and distribution systems.
- Despite these efforts, some rural areas still lack access to modern sanitation facilities, highlighting the need for continued investment in water and sanitation infrastructure.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- Greenland has a well-developed telecommunications system, with modern fiber-optic cables and mobile networks.
- Mobile coverage is widespread, with 93% of the population having access to mobile phone services.
- The country has been working to promote the development of **broadband internet** services, with a focus on improving connectivity in rural areas.
- The government has also been working to improve postal services, with regular mail deliveries to most parts of the country.
- However, the high cost of telecommunications services can be a barrier to access, particularly in rural areas.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
