[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and heating. However, the costs can be fluctuating due to the country's reliance on imported fuels and the varying cost of transportation. The electricity cost, in particular, can be high, with an average cost of $0.35 per kWh. The utility costs also vary seasonally, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased demand for heating.

The overall quality of the utility infrastructure in Greenland is good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, the costs can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited incomes. The government has implemented measures to reduce the costs, such as subsidies for low-income households and investments in renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, the utility costs in Greenland remain relatively high compared to other countries.
