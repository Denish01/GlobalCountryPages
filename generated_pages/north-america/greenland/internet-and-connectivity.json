The average internet speed in Greenland is around 10 Mbps download, which is relatively slow compared to other developed countries. However, the internet quality has been improving in recent years, with investments in new infrastructure and technology.

However, even in areas with coverage, the signal strength can be weak, and data speeds may be slow. The limited internet availability and high costs can make it challenging for residents and visitors to stay connected, especially in rural areas where other services like healthcare and education may also be limited. As a result, it is essential to plan ahead and research the best options for staying connected, especially for those who need to work or study online.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Greenland, visitors can purchase one from Tele Greenland or other mobile providers like TDC and Vodafone.
