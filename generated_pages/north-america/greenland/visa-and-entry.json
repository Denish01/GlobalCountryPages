As a territory of Denmark, Greenland's visa policy is closely aligned with that of Denmark, but there are some exceptions and special requirements due to its unique location and limited infrastructure. Currently, citizens of around 90 countries can enter Greenland without a visa, but this is subject to change, and it is essential to check the latest requirements before planning your trip.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development in Greenland. The country has a relatively small population and a fragile environment, and the government is keen to ensure that visitors respect these factors and comply with local regulations. As a result, visa requirements and regulations can be strict, especially for certain nationalities or types of visitors.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel, some EU countries may require a residence permit |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at the Danish embassy or consulate in India |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at the Danish embassy or consulate in China |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Greenland for up to 90 days without a visa, but they must have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds to support their stay.
