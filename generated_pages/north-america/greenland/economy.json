  "content": "Greenland's economy is driven by a combination of traditional industries such as fishing and hunting, as well as emerging sectors like tourism and mining, with the country relying heavily on subsidies from Denmark to support its public services and infrastructure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($2.2 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($43,000 estimate)\nIncome Classification: High\nMain Industries: Fishing, Tourism, Mining\nCurrency: DKK\nUnemployment Rate: (9% approximate)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 34th in the world, indicating a relatively favorable business environment)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nGreenland has a high-income economy, with a strong focus on traditional industries such as fishing and hunting, which have been the backbone of the country's economy for centuries. However, in recent years, the country has been working to diversify its economy, with a growing emphasis on tourism, mining, and other emerging sectors. Despite its remote location and harsh climate, Greenland has a relatively high standard of living, with a strong social safety net and high-quality public services. The country's economy is also heavily influenced by its relationship with Denmark, which provides significant subsidies to support Greenland's public services and infrastructure.\n\nGreenland's economy is classified as a high-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $43,000. However, the country's economy is also highly vulnerable to external shocks, particularly changes in global commodity prices and fluctuations in the fishing industry. The country's remote location and limited infrastructure also pose significant challenges for businesses and investors, making it difficult to establish and maintain a presence in the country.\n\nThe country's economic development is also closely tied to its natural resources, with fishing and mining being two of the most significant industries. However, the country is also working to develop its tourism industry, with a growing focus on sustainable tourism and eco-tourism. This approach aims to balance the need for economic development with the need to protect Greenland's unique and fragile environment.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fishing | 90% of exports | Greenland's fishing industry is one of the most significant in the world, with the country's waters being home to a wide range of fish species, including cod, shrimp, and halibut. |\n| Tourism | 10% of GDP | Greenland's tourism industry is growing rapidly, with a focus on sustainable tourism and eco-tourism.
