  "content": "Greenland's economy is driven by a mix of traditional industries such as fishing and hunting, as well as a growing tourism sector and emerging opportunities in mining and renewable energy.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($2.2 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($43,084 estimate)\nIncome Classification: High\nMain Industries: Fishing, Tourism, Mining\nCurrency: DKK\nUnemployment Rate: (9.1% approximate)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked around 30th globally)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nGreenland has a high-income economy, with a strong focus on the public sector and a high standard of living. The country's economy is highly dependent on subsidies from Denmark, which amounts to around 60% of the government's revenue. The economy is also characterized by a small and dispersed population, with limited connectivity and high transportation costs. Despite these challenges, Greenland has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing economy and a decline in unemployment. The country is also rich in natural resources, including fish, minerals, and potential offshore oil and gas reserves.\n\nGreenland's economic development is also influenced by its unique cultural and geographical context. The country has a strong tradition of subsistence hunting and fishing, and many Greenlanders still rely on these activities for their livelihood. At the same time, the country is also home to a growing number of modern industries, including tourism, manufacturing, and services. The government has implemented various policies to support economic development, including investments in infrastructure, education, and innovation.\n\nThe economy of Greenland is also vulnerable to external factors, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in the global economy. The country is highly dependent on exports of fish and other seafood products, and changes in global demand can have a significant impact on the economy. However, the government has been working to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on a single industry.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fishing | 90% of exports | Greenland is one of the largest fishing nations in the world, with a rich marine ecosystem and a long tradition of commercial fishing. |\n| Tourism | 10% of GDP | Tourism is a growing industry in Greenland, with visitors attracted to the country's unique landscapes, wildlife, and cultural heritage. |\n| Mining | 5% of GDP | Greenland has significant mineral resources, including iron ore, uranium, and rare earth minerals, with several major mining projects currently under development. |\n| Manufacturing | 2% of GDP | The manufacturing sector in Greenland is small but growing, with a focus on food processing, textiles, and other local products. |\n| Services | 60% of GDP | The services sector is the largest component of Greenland's economy, including public services, finance, and other business services. |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Fish and seafood products**, which account for around 90% of Greenland's exports\n- **Minerals**, including iron ore and rare earth minerals\n- **Tourism services**, which are becoming an increasingly important source of foreign exchange\n- **Textiles**, including wool and other local products\n- **Handicrafts**, including traditional Inuit carvings and other unique products\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food and beverages**, which are largely imported from Denmark and other European countries\n- **Fuel and energy**, including petroleum products and electricity\n- **Machinery and equipment**, including vehicles and other capital goods\n- **Building materials**, including construction materials and other supplies\n- **Consumer goods**, including electronics, clothing, and other household items\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Denmark, which provides significant subsidies and is the country's largest trading partner\n- China, which is an important market for Greenland's seafood exports\n- The European Union, which provides access to a large and integrated market\n- The United States, which is an important partner for trade and investment\n- Iceland, which is a key partner for trade and cooperation in the North Atlantic region\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The transportation network in Greenland is limited, with no roads connecting the country's main towns and cities.
