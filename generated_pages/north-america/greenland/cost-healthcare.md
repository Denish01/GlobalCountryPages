[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland's healthcare system is primarily public, with most medical facilities and services provided by the government. The system is generally of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. For locals, the system is largely free, with most services covered by the government. However, for foreigners, the situation is different, and medical services can be expensive. While some services may be covered by reciprocal agreements with other countries, such as Denmark, it is generally recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses.

The quality of public healthcare in Greenland is generally high, with modern hospitals and medical facilities in the major towns, such as Nuuk and Sisimiut. However, in more remote areas, medical services can be limited, and patients may need to be evacuated to a larger town or even to Denmark for more complex treatment. Private healthcare options are limited in Greenland, and most medical services are provided by the public system. However, some private clinics and medical facilities may be available in the larger towns, offering specialized services such as dental care and physiotherapy.
