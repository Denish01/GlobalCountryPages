[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland has a high-income economy, with a strong focus on the public sector and a high standard of living. The country's economy is highly dependent on subsidies from Denmark, which amounts to around 60% of the government's revenue. The economy is also characterized by a small and dispersed population, with limited connectivity and high transportation costs. Despite these challenges, Greenland has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing economy and a decline in unemployment. The country is also rich in natural resources, including fish, minerals, and potential offshore oil and gas reserves.

Greenland's economic development is also influenced by its unique cultural and geographical context. The country has a strong tradition of subsistence hunting and fishing, and many Greenlanders still rely on these activities for their livelihood. At the same time, the country is also home to a growing number of modern industries, including tourism, manufacturing, and services. The government has implemented various policies to support economic development, including investments in infrastructure, education, and innovation.

The economy of Greenland is also vulnerable to external factors, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in the global economy. The country is highly dependent on exports of fish and other seafood products, and changes in global demand can have a significant impact on the economy. However, the government has been working to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on a single industry.
