[SECTION] Overview: Greenland vs Faroe Islands [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Greenland and the Faroe Islands is influenced by their remote locations and limited access to resources. Both territories have high prices for goods and services due to the costs of transportation and importation. However, the Faroe Islands tend to be slightly more affordable, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. The economic context of both territories is also shaped by their relationship with Denmark, which provides financial support and subsidies to help mitigate the high cost of living.

The main difference in costs between Greenland and the Faroe Islands lies in the prices of basic necessities like housing, food, and utilities. Greenland's harsh climate and limited infrastructure make it more expensive to build and maintain housing, which drives up the cost of living. In contrast, the Faroe Islands have a more developed infrastructure and a stronger economy, which helps to keep prices lower. Overall, the Faroe Islands offer a more affordable lifestyle, with prices that are around 10-15% lower than in Greenland.
