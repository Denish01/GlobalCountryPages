The system is generally of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. For locals, the system is largely free, with most services covered by the government. However, for foreigners, the situation is different, and medical services can be expensive. While some services may be covered by reciprocal agreements with other countries, such as Denmark, it is generally recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe quality of public healthcare in Greenland is generally high, with modern hospitals and medical facilities in the major towns, such as Nuuk and Sisimiut. However, in more remote areas, medical services can be limited, and patients may need to be evacuated to a larger town or even to Denmark for more complex treatment. Private healthcare options are limited in Greenland, and most medical services are provided by the public system. However, some private clinics and medical facilities may be available in the larger towns, offering specialized services such as dental care and physiotherapy.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Public clinics are generally free for locals, but may charge foreigners |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$200 | $200-$500 | Private specialists may charge higher fees |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Public dental clinics are available, but may have limited services |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Optometrists and ophthalmologists are available in major towns |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals and clinics offer laboratory services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $200-$500 | Public hospitals have emergency departments, but may charge foreigners |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | Public hospitals offer inpatient services, but may have limited capacity |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Private clinics may offer specialized surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Public hospitals have maternity wards, but may charge foreigners |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Public hospitals and private clinics offer imaging services |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Public hospitals and private clinics offer radiology services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Global healthcare coverage, including emergency evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication is generally available at public pharmacies, but may require a prescription from a local doctor\n- Over-the-counter medication is available at most supermarkets and pharmacies\n- Prices for common medications, such as pain relievers and antibiotics, are generally similar to those in other developed countries\n- Some medications, such as those for chronic conditions, may be subsidized by the government for locals\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not have all medications available, especially in remote areas\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medication with you when traveling to Greenland, as well as a copy of your prescription\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 112, which is available throughout Greenland.
