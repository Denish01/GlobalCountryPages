These municipalities are responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the national government handles matters such as foreign policy, defense, and economic development. The five municipalities are Sermersooq, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qaanaaq, and Avannaata, each with its own unique character and challenges.\n\nThe division of Greenland into municipalities has helped to promote local autonomy and self-governance, allowing each region to address its specific needs and priorities. For example, the municipality of Sermersooq, which includes the capital city of Nuuk, has a strong focus on education and economic development, while the municipality of Qaanaaq has a greater emphasis on traditional hunting and fishing practices. This decentralization has helped to promote economic growth and social development in Greenland, and has allowed the country to better address the challenges posed by its remote and rugged environment.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Nuuk** (16,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Nuuk is the largest city in Greenland and serves as the country's economic and cultural center, with a rich history and a vibrant arts scene.
