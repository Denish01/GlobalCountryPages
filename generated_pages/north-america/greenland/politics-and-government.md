[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Greenland's political system is based on a parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy, with the Queen of Denmark serving as the head of state. The premier, currently Múte Bourup Egede, is the head of government and is responsible for the administration of the territory. The Inatsisartut, the unicameral parliament, has 31 seats and is elected by proportional representation for a term of four years. The political system is characterized by a separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Greenland has a unitary system of government, with the central government in Nuuk responsible for most areas of policy, although there are five municipalities with some degree of autonomy.

The Greenlandic government has a significant degree of autonomy in internal affairs, but still relies on Denmark for defense and foreign policy. This relationship is governed by the Self-Government Arrangement of 2009, which transferred more powers to the Greenlandic government and established a block grant from Denmark to support the territory's budget. The arrangement also provides for cooperation between Denmark and Greenland on issues such as foreign policy, defense, and justice.

Greenland's political system is also influenced by its cultural and historical context. The territory has a unique cultural identity, with a mix of Inuit and Danish influences. The Greenlandic language, also known as Kalaallisut, is an official language, and many Greenlanders also speak Danish. The country's history as a Danish colony has also shaped its political system, with many Greenlanders seeking greater autonomy and self-governance.
