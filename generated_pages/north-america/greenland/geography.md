[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Greenland is situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Canada and northwest of Europe, with the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Denmark Strait to the southeast. The territory is bordered by the Canadian territory of Nunavut to the west, and the Icelandic island of Jan Mayen to the east, with the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea also surrounding the island. Greenland's strategic location allows for a unique combination of Arctic and Atlantic influences, shaping its climate, culture, and ecosystem.

The island's location near the Arctic Circle means that it experiences almost 24 hours of daylight in the summer and complete darkness in the winter, with the capital city of Nuuk being a key hub for accessing the island's vast wilderness and natural resources. The neighboring countries of Canada and Iceland have historical and cultural ties with Greenland, with the Danish kingdom having sovereignty over the territory since the 18th century. The island's remote location and harsh climate have limited human settlement and economic development, but its natural resources and unique environment make it an attractive destination for scientists, adventurers, and tourists.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Greenland's terrain is characterized by a vast ice sheet, known as the **Greenland Ice Sheet**, which covers about 80% of the island, with an average thickness of 1,500 meters. The ice sheet is surrounded by a rugged coastline, with fjords, glaciers, and mountains, including the **Gunnbjørn Fjeld**, the highest peak on the island. The terrain is also marked by numerous rivers, including the **Ilulissat Icefjord**, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is home to a vast array of icebergs and marine life.

The island's landscape is also characterized by the presence of **tundra** and **arctic desert** regions, with limited vegetation and wildlife, due to the harsh climate and short growing season. However, the coastal areas and fjords support a rich marine ecosystem, with whales, seals, and fish, as well as a variety of seabirds, including **puffins** and **auks**. The unique combination of ice, rock, and water has created a diverse range of landscapes, including **glaciers**, **ice caps**, and **nunataks**, which are peaks of rock that protrude through the ice sheet.

The terrain and landscape of Greenland are also shaped by its geological history, with the island being part of the **North American tectonic plate**, and having experienced significant volcanic and tectonic activity in the past. The island's geology is characterized by the presence of **basalt** and **gabbro** rocks, which are common in volcanic regions, as well as **sedimentary** and **metamorphic** rocks, which provide evidence of the island's complex geological history.
