The main modes of transportation are by air, sea, and land, with a limited public transportation system. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with the capital city Nuuk having a more developed system than other parts of the country. Most people in Greenland get around by walking, cycling, or using private vehicles, as the public transportation system is limited and often unreliable.\n\nThe country's rugged terrain and harsh climate also make it difficult to maintain a comprehensive public transportation system. However, efforts are being made to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new airports and the expansion of existing ones. Additionally, many Greenlanders use **snowmobiles** and **dog sleds** as a means of transportation, especially in rural areas where roads are scarce.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $3-$5 | $100-$130 | Limited coverage, mainly in Nuuk |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in Nuuk |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $10 | $2-$3 | $15-$25 | Limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, limited options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $2.50 | High due to import costs |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $2.20 | High due to import costs |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $80-$150 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $50-$100 | Limited routes, mainly along the west coast |\n| Domestic Flight | $200-$500 | Typical route, e.g., Nuuk to Ilulissat |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or sharing a taxi with others.\n- Download the **Rejseplanen** app to plan your journey and get the latest transportation schedules.\n- Be prepared for variable weather conditions and potential delays when traveling in Greenland.\n- Negotiate the taxi fare before you start your journey, as some taxis may not have meters.\n- Consider renting a car or booking a guided tour to explore the country's remote areas.\n- Always check the latest **weather forecast** before embarking on a journey, especially when traveling by air or sea.",
