[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Greenland operates under a **territorial taxation** system, where only income derived from sources within Greenland is subject to taxation, as opposed to a worldwide taxation system where all income, regardless of source, is taxed. This distinction is crucial for individuals and businesses with international income streams. Residency rules for tax purposes in Greenland are based on physical presence, where an individual is considered a tax resident if they have been present in Greenland for more than 6 months in a calendar year.

The tax system in Greenland is closely tied to that of Denmark due to its status as a territory of Denmark. This relationship affects various aspects of taxation, including tax treaties and the application of tax laws. Understanding the nuances of Greenland's tax system, including its territorial taxation approach and residency rules, is key to navigating the tax environment effectively.
