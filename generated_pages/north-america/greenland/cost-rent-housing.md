[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Greenland is relatively small and competitive, with a high demand for housing, particularly in the capital city of Nuuk. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by Danish law, which applies to Greenland as a territory of Denmark. However, the housing market in Greenland is unique due to its remote location and limited supply of housing, which can drive up prices. Compared to regional neighbors such as Canada and Iceland, Greenland's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center of Nuuk.

The housing market in Greenland is also influenced by the country's harsh climate and limited access to certain areas, which can affect the availability and affordability of housing. Additionally, the cost of living in Greenland is generally high due to the need to import many goods from other countries, which can make it challenging for renters to find affordable housing options. Despite these challenges, the Greenlandic government has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of housing and reduce costs, such as subsidies for housing construction and rental assistance programs.
