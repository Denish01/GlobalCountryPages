[SECTION] Overview: Greenland vs Canada [/SECTION]
Greenland and Canada are two distinct countries with different economic contexts, which significantly impact their cost of living. Greenland, as a territory of Denmark, has a high standard of living, but its remote location and limited accessibility drive up costs. In contrast, Canada is a vast and economically diverse country with a lower cost of living. The main difference between the two countries lies in their economic structures, with Greenland relying heavily on subsidies from Denmark and Canada having a more self-sufficient economy. As a result, Greenland tends to be more expensive, especially when it comes to housing, food, and transportation.

The cost of living in Greenland is also influenced by its harsh Arctic climate, which requires specialized infrastructure and logistics. This, in turn, increases the cost of living, making it challenging for residents to afford basic necessities. In contrast, Canada's larger population and more diverse economy provide a wider range of affordable options for housing, food, and transportation. Overall, Canada is generally the more affordable option, with a lower cost of living that is roughly 20-30% lower than in Greenland.
