[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
El Salvador's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with most areas having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season (December to April) due to increased demand for electricity and water. The overall quality of the utility infrastructure is good, with minimal outages and disruptions. The government has implemented measures to stabilize the cost of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and regulations to control price increases.

The cost of utilities in El Salvador is also affected by the country's geography, with areas in the highlands tend to have higher electricity costs due to the need for more energy to power heating systems. Additionally, the cost of water can vary depending on the location, with areas near the coast tend to have lower water costs due to the availability of natural water sources. Overall, the cost of utilities in El Salvador is relatively stable, with minimal fluctuations in prices over the past few years.
