The country's population growth rate has been steadily declining, from 1.5% in the 1990s to 0.5% in recent years. This decline is largely due to a decrease in fertility rates, as well as an increase in migration to other countries, particularly the United States. Urbanization is also a significant trend in El Salvador, with approximately 70% of the population living in urban areas. The capital city, San Salvador, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 540,000 people.\n\nEl Salvador's population is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the country and to other countries. Many Salvadorans have migrated to the United States in search of better economic opportunities, and it is estimated that there are over 2 million Salvadorans living in the United States. This migration has had a significant impact on El Salvador's economy, with remittances from abroad accounting for a substantial portion of the country's GDP.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by migration and urbanization, El Salvador's population is also characterized by a strong sense of community and cultural identity.
