[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
El Salvador is easily accessible by air, with the Monseñor Óscar Arnulfo Romero International Airport (SAL) serving as the main gateway to the country. This airport is located about 50 kilometers east of San Salvador, the capital city, and offers direct flights to major hubs in the United States, Central America, and Mexico. You can fly into El Salvador from cities like Miami, Los Angeles, Houston, and Panama City, among others. If you prefer to travel overland, you can enter El Salvador by bus or car from neighboring Guatemala or Honduras, with several border crossings available, including the busy El Poy border crossing with Honduras.

Travelers can also arrive in El Salvador by sea, with several ports along the country's Pacific coast, including the Port of Acajutla, which receives cargo ships and cruise liners. However, this option is less common for tourists and more geared towards cargo and commercial traffic. Once you arrive in El Salvador, you can use a range of transportation options to get to your final destination, including taxis, buses, and rental cars. It's also a good idea to research your transportation options in advance, especially if you're traveling to more remote areas of the country.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
El Salvador has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airline is **TAG Airlines**, which offers flights from San Salvador to several smaller airports around the country, including the coastal town of **Cesár Berroa**. You can book domestic flights online or through a local travel agent, and prices are generally reasonable, with a one-way ticket costing around $100-$200. However, it's worth noting that domestic flights may not be as frequent as you'd like, so it's a good idea to plan ahead and book your flights in advance to ensure availability.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
El Salvador has no rail network, so train travel is not an option. The country's terrain and geography have made it difficult to build and maintain a rail system, and as a result, buses and cars are the primary modes of transportation. However, there are some **tourist trains** that operate on a limited basis, offering scenic rides through the countryside. These trains are more geared towards tourists and are not a practical way to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses are a popular and affordable way to get around El Salvador, with several companies operating intercity routes. Some of the main bus companies include **Pullmantur**, **Ticabus**, and **Fuentes del Norte**, which offer a range of services, from budget-friendly options to more luxurious coaches with air conditioning and reclining seats. Bus fares are generally cheap, with a one-way ticket costing around $5-$10, depending on the route and type of service. You can book bus tickets online or at the bus station, and it's a good idea to research your options in advance to find the best route and schedule for your needs.
