The country's economy is driven by a combination of traditional industries, such as textiles and agriculture, as well as a growing services sector. El Salvador's economic development has been shaped by its strategic location in Central America, with a long coastline along the Pacific Ocean and borders with Guatemala and Honduras. The country has a relatively high level of human development, with a strong emphasis on education and healthcare. However, El Salvador still faces significant challenges, including high levels of poverty and inequality, as well as a lack of diversification in its economy.\n\nThe Salvadoran economy has undergone significant changes in recent years, with a shift towards a more service-oriented economy. The country has also made efforts to improve its business environment, with reforms aimed at simplifying procedures and reducing bureaucracy. Despite these efforts, El Salvador still faces challenges in terms of competitiveness and productivity, with a need for greater investment in infrastructure and human capital. The country's economic growth has been steady, but moderate, with an average annual growth rate of around 2-3% in recent years.\n\nEl Salvador's economy is also heavily dependent on remittances from abroad, with many Salvadorans working in the United States and sending money back to their families. This has helped to boost consumer spending and support economic growth, but it also makes the country vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy. Overall, El Salvador's economy is at a crossroads, with a need for greater diversification and investment in key sectors in order to drive sustainable growth and development.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Textiles | 20% of GDP | Major exports include clothing, fabrics, and yarns |\n| Agriculture | 15% of GDP | Main crops include coffee, sugar, and corn |\n| Services | 60% of GDP | Includes financial services, tourism, and telecommunications |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | Includes food processing, construction materials, and pharmaceuticals |\n| Tourism | 5% of GDP | Major attractions include beaches, volcanoes, and colonial towns |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Textiles**: clothing, fabrics, and yarns\n- **Agricultural products**: coffee, sugar, and corn\n- **Manufactured goods**: food processing, construction materials, and pharmaceuticals\n- **Electronics**: computer components and telecommunications equipment\n- **Energy**: petroleum products and natural gas\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Petroleum products**: fuel, diesel, and gasoline\n- **Machinery**: industrial equipment and vehicles\n- **Electronics**: consumer goods and computer components\n- **Chemicals**: pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals\n- **Food**: wheat, rice, and other staple crops\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- United States: major market for exports and source of imports\n- Guatemala: regional trade partner and neighbor\n- Honduras: regional trade partner and neighbor\n- China: growing trade partner and source of imports\n- Mexico: regional trade partner and source of imports\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Transport networks: El Salvador has a well-developed road network, with major highways connecting the capital city to the rest of the country and neighboring countries.
