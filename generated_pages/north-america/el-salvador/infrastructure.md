[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
El Salvador's infrastructure has seen significant investments in recent years, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors. However, the country still faces challenges in providing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, especially in rural areas. The urban-rural gap is a significant issue, with cities like San Salvador and Santa Ana having relatively modern infrastructure, while rural areas often lack access to basic services. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on expanding access to electricity, improving road networks, and increasing investment in water and sanitation systems.

The country's geographic location makes it prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which can have a significant impact on its infrastructure. As a result, there is a need for infrastructure development that is resilient to these types of events. El Salvador has been working to strengthen its infrastructure, with a focus on building back better after disasters and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure.

Overall, El Salvador's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with a need for continued investment and development to meet the needs of its growing population. The government has set ambitious goals for infrastructure development, including increasing access to electricity and improving the quality of roads and highways.
