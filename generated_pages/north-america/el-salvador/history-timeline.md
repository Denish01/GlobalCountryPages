# El Salvador History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of El Salvador is a complex and multifaceted narrative that spans over 2,000 years, from the earliest known indigenous civilizations to the modern era, marked by colonialism, independence, and ongoing social and economic development.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of El Salvador began with the arrival of the **Pipil** and **Nahuat** indigenous groups around 2000 BCE, who established a thriving civilization in the region. The **Maya** civilization also had a significant presence in the area, with the city of **Joyas de Cerén** being a notable archaeological site. In 1524, the Spanish conquistador **Pedro de Alvarado** arrived in El Salvador, marking the beginning of the colonial period, which lasted for nearly three centuries. During this time, the indigenous population was decimated by disease, slavery, and violence, and the country's economy was centered on the production of **indigo**, a valuable dye. El Salvador gained independence from Spain in 1821, as part of the **Captaincy General of Guatemala**, and later became a sovereign state in 1838.

The 20th century was marked by significant social and economic changes in El Salvador, including the rise of the **coffee** industry, which became a major driver of the country's economy. However, this period was also marked by **poverty**, **inequality**, and **political instability**, which ultimately led to a devastating **civil war** that lasted from 1979 to 1992. The war resulted in the deaths of over 75,000 people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more. In the post-war period, El Salvador has made significant progress in terms of **democratization** and **economic development**, with a growing economy and a strengthening of democratic institutions.

The country's history has been shaped by its strategic location in the region, with El Salvador playing a key role in the **Central American** integration process. The country has also been affected by **natural disasters**, including earthquakes and hurricanes, which have had a significant impact on the population and the economy. Today, El Salvador is a **sovereign state** with a population of over 6 million people, and a economy that is driven by a mix of **agriculture**, **industry**, and **services**.

The history of El Salvador is also marked by the presence of **US influence**, which has had a significant impact on the country's politics, economy, and culture. The US has provided significant **economic aid** to El Salvador, and has also played a key role in shaping the country's **foreign policy**. However, this influence has also been the subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing that it has undermined the country's **sovereignty** and **independence**.
