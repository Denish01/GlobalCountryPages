[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
El Salvador has a lower-middle-income economy, with a mix of industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. The country's economy is driven by a combination of traditional industries, such as textiles and agriculture, as well as a growing services sector. El Salvador's economic development has been shaped by its strategic location in Central America, with a long coastline along the Pacific Ocean and borders with Guatemala and Honduras. The country has a relatively high level of human development, with a strong emphasis on education and healthcare. However, El Salvador still faces significant challenges, including high levels of poverty and inequality, as well as a lack of diversification in its economy.

The Salvadoran economy has undergone significant changes in recent years, with a shift towards a more service-oriented economy. The country has also made efforts to improve its business environment, with reforms aimed at simplifying procedures and reducing bureaucracy. Despite these efforts, El Salvador still faces challenges in terms of competitiveness and productivity, with a need for greater investment in infrastructure and human capital. The country's economic growth has been steady, but moderate, with an average annual growth rate of around 2-3% in recent years.

El Salvador's economy is also heavily dependent on remittances from abroad, with many Salvadorans working in the United States and sending money back to their families. This has helped to boost consumer spending and support economic growth, but it also makes the country vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy. Overall, El Salvador's economy is at a crossroads, with a need for greater diversification and investment in key sectors in order to drive sustainable growth and development.
