  "content": "Healthcare in El Salvador is a mixed system, combining both public and private facilities, with varying levels of quality and accessibility throughout the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 911\nHospital Standard: Adequate\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in El Salvador is composed of both public and private facilities, with the public system being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which operates a network of hospitals and clinics throughout the country. However, the public system often faces challenges such as limited resources, outdated equipment, and a shortage of medical staff, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost, making them inaccessible to many Salvadorans. Urban areas, such as San Salvador, tend to have better access to quality healthcare compared to rural areas, where medical facilities may be more basic and understaffed.\n\nThe quality of care in El Salvador varies greatly depending on the facility and the location. In general, private hospitals and clinics offer better quality care, with more modern equipment and better-trained medical staff. However, even in private facilities, the quality of care can be inconsistent, and patients may need to seek a second opinion or travel to another country for more complex or specialized care. The public system, on the other hand, often struggles to provide adequate care due to limited resources and a shortage of medical staff.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Salvadoran government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new equipment and training for medical staff. Additionally, some private hospitals and clinics have begun to offer specialized services, such as cancer treatment and cardiovascular care, which were previously only available in other countries.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital Divina Providencia | San Salvador | Private | Cardiology, Oncology, Neurology | Yes |\n| Hospital San Rafael | San Salvador | Private | General Surgery, Orthopedics, Urology | Yes |\n| Hospital Rosales | San Salvador | Public | General Medicine, Pediatrics, Obstetrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Biblica | San Salvador | Private | General Medicine, Dermatology, Ophthalmology | Yes |\n| Hospital Militar | San Salvador | Military | General Medicine, Surgery, Trauma | Limited |\n| Hospital de la Mujer | San Salvador | Public | Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for anyone living or traveling in El Salvador, as it can provide access to better quality care and help cover the costs of medical treatment.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expats** should consider purchasing international health insurance, which can provide coverage in multiple countries and offer more comprehensive benefits.\n- **Costs** can vary greatly depending on the type of insurance and the level of coverage, but expect to pay around $50-100 per month for a basic plan.\n- **Pre-existing conditions** may not be covered by some insurance plans, so it's essential to disclose any medical conditions when applying for insurance.\n- **Group insurance plans** may be available for companies or organizations, which can provide more comprehensive coverage at a lower cost.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in El Salvador, with many pharmacies located throughout the country.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many common medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** such as Bayer, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson are widely available, but generic options may also be available at a lower cost.\n- **Costs** can vary depending on the medication and the pharmacy, but expect to pay around $10-50 for a prescription medication.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies open late or 24 hours a day, making it easy to access medications when needed.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **Typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to El Salvador.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for anyone who will be working with animals or spending time in rural areas.\n- **Zika** and **Dengue fever** are present in El Salvador, and travelers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking tap water or eating unpeeled fruits and vegetables.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables.\n- **Chikungunya** and **Leptospirosis** are also present in El Salvador, and travelers should take precautions to avoid exposure.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Dental care** is a popular medical tourism option in El Salvador, with many clinics offering high-quality care at a lower cost than in the US or other developed countries.\n- **Cosmetic surgery** is also available, with many clinics offering procedures such as breast augmentation and liposuction.\n- **Accredited hospitals** such as the Hospital Divina Providencia and the Hospital San Rafael offer high-quality care and are popular with medical tourists.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many procedures costing 50-70% less than in the US or other developed countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital, which may be a public or private facility depending on the location.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can be a concern, and travelers may need to rely on taxis or other transportation to get to a hospital.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a mapping app, and travelers should research the location of nearby hospitals before an emergency arises.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed as soon as possible after an emergency, and travelers should keep all receipts and documentation related to their medical care.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, and travelers should research their insurance options and emergency evacuation procedures before traveling to El Salvador.",
