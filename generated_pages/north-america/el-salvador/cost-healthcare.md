[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
El Salvador has a mixed healthcare system that combines both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, but it is more affordable for locals. The public system is managed by the Ministry of Health and provides basic medical care to all citizens, regardless of their income level. However, the public system often faces challenges such as limited resources, long wait times, and a shortage of specialized medical professionals. On the other hand, the private healthcare system in El Salvador is considered to be of high quality, with modern facilities and well-trained medical professionals. Many private hospitals and clinics cater to foreigners and offer a range of specialized medical services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, and fertility treatments.

For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in El Salvador, as medical costs can be high, especially in private hospitals. Many private hospitals and clinics require payment upfront, and some may not accept international health insurance. Locals, on the other hand, can access public healthcare services for free or at a low cost, but they may still choose to use private healthcare services for more specialized or complex medical needs. Overall, the healthcare system in El Salvador can be complex, and it is essential to research and understand the options available before seeking medical care.
