[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in El Salvador is composed of both public and private facilities, with the public system being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which operates a network of hospitals and clinics throughout the country. However, the public system often faces challenges such as limited resources, outdated equipment, and a shortage of medical staff, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost, making them inaccessible to many Salvadorans. Urban areas, such as San Salvador, tend to have better access to quality healthcare compared to rural areas, where medical facilities may be more basic and understaffed.

The quality of care in El Salvador varies greatly depending on the facility and the location. In general, private hospitals and clinics offer better quality care, with more modern equipment and better-trained medical staff. However, even in private facilities, the quality of care can be inconsistent, and patients may need to seek a second opinion or travel to another country for more complex or specialized care. The public system, on the other hand, often struggles to provide adequate care due to limited resources and a shortage of medical staff.

Despite these challenges, the Salvadoran government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new equipment and training for medical staff. Additionally, some private hospitals and clinics have begun to offer specialized services, such as cancer treatment and cardiovascular care, which were previously only available in other countries.
