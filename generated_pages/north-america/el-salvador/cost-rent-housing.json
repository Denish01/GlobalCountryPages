Typical lease terms are for one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it's essential to understand the terms of the lease agreement before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Guatemala and Honduras, El Salvador's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a lower cost of living in general. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with the city center and coastal areas tend to be more expensive than inland regions.\n\nThe housing market in El Salvador is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a relatively low inflation rate of 0.8% and a stable currency, the US dollar. This stability can make it easier for expats and investors to navigate the market. Additionally, the government has implemented initiatives to improve housing affordability, such as subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable housing. Despite these efforts, there is still a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly in urban areas, which can drive up prices and make it challenging for some people to find a place to live.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | Basic amenities, 20-30 sqm |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | Standard amenities, 40-60 sqm |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,200 | $400-$800 | Family-sized, 80-120 sqm |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,000-$2,000 | $600-$1,200 | Spacious, 120-180 sqm |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | Residential areas, good amenities |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | Limited amenities, natural surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Escalón**: A popular neighborhood in San Salvador, known for its safety and amenities, with rent ranging from $400 to $800 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Santa Elena**: A family-friendly neighborhood with a mix of modern and traditional housing, rent ranging from $300 to $600 per month.\n- **San Benito**: A bustling neighborhood with a variety of restaurants and shops, rent ranging from $350 to $700 per month.\n- **Antiguo Cuscatlán**: A historic neighborhood with a mix of old and new housing, rent ranging from $250 to $500 per month.\n- **Zona Rosa**: A trendy neighborhood with a mix of modern apartments and restaurants, rent ranging from $500 to $1,000 per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for El Salvador [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a trustworthy landlord and a fair price.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease agreement.\n- Be aware of potential scams, such as fake listings or unscrupulous landlords.\n- Utilities are usually not included in the rent, so factor in the cost of electricity, water, and internet when budgeting.\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished ones, so be prepared to bring your own furniture or negotiate with the landlord to include some basic items.",
