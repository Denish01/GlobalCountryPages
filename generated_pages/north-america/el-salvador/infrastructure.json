  "content": "The infrastructure in El Salvador is moderately developed, with a mix of modern and outdated systems, particularly noticeable in the disparity between urban and rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 94% of population\nInternet Penetration: 55%\nRoad Network: 6,126 km, with good quality highways and moderate quality rural roads\nRail Network: 13 km, largely inactive\nMajor Airports: 5\nMajor Ports: 2, including the Port of Acajutla and the Port of Cutuco\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nEl Salvador's infrastructure has seen significant investments in recent years, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors. However, the country still faces challenges in providing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, especially in rural areas. The urban-rural gap is a significant issue, with cities like San Salvador and Santa Ana having relatively modern infrastructure, while rural areas often lack access to basic services. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on expanding access to electricity, improving road networks, and increasing investment in water and sanitation systems.\n\nThe country's geographic location makes it prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which can have a significant impact on its infrastructure. As a result, there is a need for infrastructure development that is resilient to these types of events. El Salvador has been working to strengthen its infrastructure, with a focus on building back better after disasters and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\nOverall, El Salvador's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with a need for continued investment and development to meet the needs of its growing population. The government has set ambitious goals for infrastructure development, including increasing access to electricity and improving the quality of roads and highways.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 6,126 km | Good/Moderate | Highways are generally well-maintained, while rural roads can be in poor condition |\n| Railways | 13 km | Poor | Rail network is largely inactive and in disrepair |\n| Airports | 5 international, 10 domestic | Good | Major airports are well-maintained, with modern facilities |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Ports are relatively well-maintained, but could benefit from modernization |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- El Salvador has a diverse energy mix, with a combination of **thermal**, **hydro**, and **geothermal** power generation sources.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing access to electricity, with 94% of the population now having access to electricity.\n- However, the electricity grid is still prone to **outages**, particularly during peak demand periods.\n- El Salvador has set ambitious goals for increasing its use of **renewable energy**, with a target of 40% of electricity generation coming from renewable sources by 2025.\n- The government has implemented programs to promote energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, including the use of **energy-efficient lighting** and **appliances**.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is not always safe to drink, particularly in rural areas, where access to clean water is limited.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with 85% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- However, there are still significant disparities in access to water and sanitation, particularly in rural areas, where many communities lack access to basic services.\n- The government has implemented programs to improve access to water and sanitation, including the construction of new **water treatment plants** and **sewage systems**.\n- El Salvador has also made progress in increasing access to **hygiene** and **sanitation facilities**, particularly in schools and healthcare facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic** internet is available in major cities, but **broadband** penetration is still relatively low, at around 20%.\n- The government has implemented programs to increase access to **4G** and **5G** mobile networks, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Postal services** are relatively underdeveloped, with limited access to mail and package delivery services, particularly in rural areas.\n- El Salvador has made significant progress in increasing access to **internet services**, with a number of **internet cafes** and **public access points** available, particularly in urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a number of major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of a new **highway** connecting San Salvador to the Port of Acajutla.\n- The **Central America Integration System** has provided funding for a number of infrastructure development projects, including the construction of new **border crossings** and **transportation corridors**.\n- El Salvador has also received funding from international organizations, such as the **World Bank**, to support infrastructure development projects, including the construction of new **water treatment plants** and **sewage systems**.\n- The government has set ambitious goals for increasing investment in infrastructure, with a target of increasing infrastructure spending to 5% of GDP by 2025.\n- The **Private Sector** is also playing a significant role in infrastructure development, with a number of private companies investing in **public-private partnerships** to develop new infrastructure projects.",
