However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the dry season (December to April) due to increased demand for electricity and water. The overall quality of the utility infrastructure is good, with minimal outages and disruptions. The government has implemented measures to stabilize the cost of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and regulations to control price increases.\n\nThe cost of utilities in El Salvador is also affected by the country's geography, with areas in the highlands tend to have higher electricity costs due to the need for more energy to power heating systems. Additionally, the cost of water can vary depending on the location, with areas near the coast tend to have lower water costs due to the availability of natural water sources. Overall, the cost of utilities in El Salvador is relatively stable, with minimal fluctuations in prices over the past few years.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $60 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in municipal tax) |\n| **Total** | **$100** | **$160** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 50-100 Mbps | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-30 | 1-5 GB | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-10 GB | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $9.99 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $9.99 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5-10 | (e.g. Claro Video) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the provider directly and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans are more common and often offer better rates.\n- Claro and Tigo are the most popular internet providers in El Salvador, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances and turn off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- Consider bundling phone and internet services to get a better rate and more convenient billing.",
