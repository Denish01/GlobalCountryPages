[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
El Salvador has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by clear skies, warm temperatures, and minimal rainfall. This is the best time to visit the country's beaches, volcanic lakes, and national parks. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and an increased risk of hurricanes. During this time, some roads may become impassable, and outdoor activities may be limited. The country's climate can be divided into three zones: the coastal region, which is hot and humid; the mountainous region, which is cooler and more temperate; and the interior region, which is dry and hot.

The seasons in El Salvador have a significant impact on travel. During the dry season, tourists can enjoy a wide range of outdoor activities, such as hiking, surfing, and exploring the country's many archaeological sites. The dry season is also the best time to visit the country's colonial towns, such as **Suchitoto** and **Ataco**, which are filled with colorful buildings, historic landmarks, and vibrant cultural events. In contrast, the wet season can make travel more challenging, especially in rural areas where roads may be washed out or impassable.

The country's geography also plays a role in determining the best time to visit. The coastal region, which is home to many of El Salvador's popular beaches, is generally hotter and more humid than the interior region. The mountainous region, which includes the **Santa Ana Volcano** and the **Cerro Verde National Park**, is cooler and more temperate, making it an ideal destination for hikers and nature lovers.
