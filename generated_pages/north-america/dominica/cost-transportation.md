[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Dominica is a small island nation with a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, making it challenging to get around without a car. The main transportation modes include buses, minibuses, and taxis, with most people relying on these services to travel within and between cities. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and cities, but the lack of a comprehensive transportation network can make it difficult to explore the island's more rural areas.

The government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, with a focus on upgrading roads and expanding public transportation services. However, the island's rugged terrain and limited resources can make it difficult to maintain a reliable and efficient transportation system. As a result, many locals and tourists alike often rely on taxis and private car rentals to get around, which can be more expensive but offer greater flexibility and convenience.
