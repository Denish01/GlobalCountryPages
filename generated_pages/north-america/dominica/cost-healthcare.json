  "content": "In Dominica, healthcare costs vary between public and private facilities, with the average health expenditure per capita being $492, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 29.3% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $492\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 29.3%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 999\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XCD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nDominica's healthcare system is a mix of public and private facilities, with the public sector providing essential medical services to the population, while private clinics and hospitals offer more specialized and advanced care. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, with longer waiting times and limited resources. For locals, the public system is often the primary source of healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of private healthcare can be high.\n\nThe healthcare system in Dominica is designed to provide universal access to essential medical services, with public facilities offering free or low-cost care to citizens. However, the quality of care can vary significantly between public and private facilities, with private clinics and hospitals often having more modern equipment and better-trained staff. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek private care, as the quality of care is generally higher and the staff may be more familiar with international medical standards. Additionally, many private facilities in Dominica have relationships with international insurance providers, making it easier for foreigners to receive reimbursement for medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have longer waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Private dentists may offer more cosmetic services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public hospitals may have longer waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Private hospitals may have more advanced equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Private hospitals may offer more personalized care |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Private clinics may offer faster results |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private hospital care, specialist consultations, advanced medical services |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, advanced medical services |\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be purchased at public and private pharmacies, with prices varying depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and some supermarkets.\n- The cost of common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can range from $5 to $20.\n- **Prescription rules** in Dominica are generally similar to those in other countries, with some medications requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good, with many pharmacies located in Roseau and other major towns.\n- Some pharmacies may offer **discounts** for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 999 or visit the nearest hospital.
