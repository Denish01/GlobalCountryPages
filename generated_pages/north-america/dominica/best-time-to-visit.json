[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nDominica is a tropical island with a warm and humid climate year-round, with two distinct seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by low humidity and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit the island. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and higher humidity, with the most significant risk of hurricanes and tropical storms from September to November. The climate varies across different parts of the island, with the coastal areas being generally hotter and drier than the mountainous regions. The island's unique geography, with its rugged terrain and scenic valleys, makes it a popular destination for hikers, nature lovers, and adventure seekers.\n\nThe dry season is the best time to engage in outdoor activities such as hiking, **snorkeling**, and **scuba diving**, as the weather is calm and sunny. The wet season, on the other hand, is better suited for **birdwatching** and **whale watching**, as the heavy rainfall brings out the island's lush vegetation and attracts a variety of marine life. The island's capital, **Roseau**, is a great place to experience the local culture and cuisine, with its vibrant markets, historic landmarks, and delicious Creole cuisine.\n\nThe weather and seasons have a significant impact on travel to Dominica, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, the island's popular attractions and **beaches** can get crowded, and prices for accommodations and tours tend to be higher.
