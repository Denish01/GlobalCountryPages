[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Dominica is relatively small, but it offers a range of options for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are one to two years, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Restriction Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Martinique and Guadeloupe, Dominica's housing costs are relatively affordable. However, the market can be competitive, especially in the capital city of Roseau, where demand for housing is high.

The housing market in Dominica is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many properties being rented out to tourists on a short-term basis. This can drive up prices and reduce the availability of long-term rentals. Additionally, the market is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with prices tend to be higher during the peak tourist season. Despite these challenges, Dominica's housing market offers a range of options for those looking to rent or buy, from **beachfront apartments** to **mountainous retreats**.
