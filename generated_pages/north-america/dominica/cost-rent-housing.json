Typical lease terms are one to two years, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Restriction Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Martinique and Guadeloupe, Dominica's housing costs are relatively affordable. However, the market can be competitive, especially in the capital city of Roseau, where demand for housing is high.\n\nThe housing market in Dominica is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many properties being rented out to tourists on a short-term basis. This can drive up prices and reduce the availability of long-term rentals. Additionally, the market is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with prices tend to be higher during the peak tourist season. Despite these challenges, Dominica's housing market offers a range of options for those looking to rent or buy, from **beachfront apartments** to **mountainous retreats**.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $500-$800 | $300-$600 | Basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | Fully furnished, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,400 | Spacious, modern amenities, private balcony |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$2,000 | Large, fully furnished, private yard or garden |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, modern amenities, sea views |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | Residential areas, family-friendly, easy access to amenities |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | Scenic views, peaceful surroundings, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Roseau**: The capital city offers a range of accommodation options, from apartments to houses, with easy access to amenities and services.
