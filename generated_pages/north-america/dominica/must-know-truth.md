# The Truth About Dominica - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Dominica, an island nation located in the Caribbean, has a rich and diverse history. The island was first inhabited by the **Kalinago** people, an indigenous tribe, before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1493, Christopher Columbus sighted the island on his second voyage to the New World. The Spanish claimed the island, but it was the French who established the first permanent settlement in 1699. The French colonization of Dominica lasted until 1763, when the island was ceded to the British. The British established a colonial government, and the island remained a British colony until it gained independence on November 3, 1978.

The road to independence was a long and complex one. Dominica was a member of the **West Indies Federation**, a short-lived federation of British colonies in the Caribbean, from 1958 to 1962. After the federation dissolved, Dominica became an **associated state** of the United Kingdom, with internal self-government but external affairs handled by the British. This arrangement lasted until 1978, when Dominica gained full independence.

The early years of independence were marked by political instability and economic challenges. The country faced significant debt and a decline in the banana industry, which had been a major driver of the economy. However, in recent years, Dominica has made significant progress in diversifying its economy and developing its tourism sector.

The country's history is also marked by its natural environment. Dominica is often referred to as the **"Nature Island"** of the Caribbean, due to its lush rainforests, hot springs, and diverse wildlife. The island's unique natural features have made it an attractive destination for tourists and a key part of the country's economic development strategy.
