However, costs can fluctuate due to seasonal variation in demand and global market trends. During the peak tourist season, which runs from December to April, utility costs may be higher due to increased demand for services. Additionally, the island's remote location and lack of economies of scale can drive up costs for certain utilities, such as electricity and internet.\n\nThe government of Dominica has implemented measures to stabilize utility costs and promote energy efficiency, including the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Despite these efforts, utility costs can still be a significant expense for residents and visitors alike. It's essential to research and compare rates among different service providers to find the best deals and plan for seasonal variations in usage.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane or gas stove) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in property tax) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 10-20 Mbps | Flow, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 60-100 Mbps | Flow, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Digicel, Flow |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 5-10 GB | Digicel, Flow |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-120 | varies | Flow, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $13 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $10 | (not available) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, contact the service providers directly or visit their websites to apply for services and schedule installations.\n- Consider prepaid electricity plans to avoid surprise bills and track usage more closely.\n- Choose between Flow and Digicel for internet and phone services, as they offer competitive rates and reliable coverage.\n- Take advantage of energy-efficient appliances and practices to reduce electricity consumption and lower bills.\n- Research and compare rates among different service providers to find the best deals and plan for seasonal variations in usage.",
