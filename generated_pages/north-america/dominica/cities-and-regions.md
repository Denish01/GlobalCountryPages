[SECTION] How Dominica Is Divided [/SECTION]
Dominica is a sovereign island nation located in the Caribbean Sea, and it is divided into 10 parishes. These parishes are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and they are responsible for providing local government services to their residents. The parishes are further divided into villages and towns, which are often centered around a local church or community center. The country's capital, Roseau, is located in the Saint George parish and serves as the commercial and economic hub of the island.

The parish system in Dominica is a legacy of the country's colonial past, and it has been in place since the 18th century. Each parish has its own unique character and identity, shaped by its history, geography, and culture. The parishes are also responsible for managing their own local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. This system of government allows for a high degree of autonomy and self-governance at the local level, which is reflective of Dominica's strong sense of community and tradition.
