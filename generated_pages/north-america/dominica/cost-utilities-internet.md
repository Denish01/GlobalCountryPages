[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Dominica's utility infrastructure is generally well-maintained, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, costs can fluctuate due to seasonal variation in demand and global market trends. During the peak tourist season, which runs from December to April, utility costs may be higher due to increased demand for services. Additionally, the island's remote location and lack of economies of scale can drive up costs for certain utilities, such as electricity and internet.

The government of Dominica has implemented measures to stabilize utility costs and promote energy efficiency, including the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Despite these efforts, utility costs can still be a significant expense for residents and visitors alike. It's essential to research and compare rates among different service providers to find the best deals and plan for seasonal variations in usage.
