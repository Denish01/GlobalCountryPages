[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Dominica's healthcare system is a mix of public and private facilities, with the public sector providing essential medical services to the population, while private clinics and hospitals offer more specialized and advanced care. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, with longer waiting times and limited resources. For locals, the public system is often the primary source of healthcare, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of private healthcare can be high.

The healthcare system in Dominica is designed to provide universal access to essential medical services, with public facilities offering free or low-cost care to citizens. However, the quality of care can vary significantly between public and private facilities, with private clinics and hospitals often having more modern equipment and better-trained staff. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek private care, as the quality of care is generally higher and the staff may be more familiar with international medical standards. Additionally, many private facilities in Dominica have relationships with international insurance providers, making it easier for foreigners to receive reimbursement for medical expenses.
