[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Dominica's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the government playing a significant role in delivering healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally good, with several hospitals and health centers throughout the island, although services can be limited in rural areas. The quality of care is generally good, with many medical professionals trained in the United States or the United Kingdom. However, the system can be overwhelmed during peak tourist season, and some specialized services may not be available. Urban areas, such as Roseau, tend to have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas may have more limited options.

The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and user fees, while private healthcare providers offer a range of services, including specialist care and diagnostic testing. Many locals and visitors alike opt for private healthcare services, which can be more expensive but often provide faster and more specialized care. Despite the challenges, Dominica's healthcare system has made significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on preventive care and public health initiatives.

Overall, Dominica's healthcare system is well-equipped to handle common medical issues, but may not have the resources or specialized care for more complex or rare conditions. Visitors and expats are advised to have adequate health insurance coverage, as medical evacuation to another island or country may be necessary in some cases.
