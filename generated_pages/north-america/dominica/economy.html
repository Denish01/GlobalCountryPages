        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Dominica's economy is a developing, upper-middle-income economy that is driven primarily by tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing. The country's economy has been steadily growing over the years, with a focus on sustainable development and diversification of its industries. As a sovereign nation, Dominica has been working to reduce its dependence on a single industry and to promote economic growth through investments in infrastructure, education, and innovation. The country's unique natural environment, with its lush rainforests, hot springs, and waterfalls, makes it an attractive destination for tourists, and the tourism industry has been a key driver of economic growth.</p>
        <p>The economy of Dominica is also heavily reliant on agriculture, with the country producing a range of crops, including bananas, citrus fruits, and root vegetables. The manufacturing sector is also significant, with a focus on food processing, soap production, and other light industries. The country's economy has been impacted by natural disasters, including hurricanes, which have caused significant damage to infrastructure and the agricultural sector. However, the government has been working to rebuild and diversify the economy, with a focus on sustainable development and resilience.</p>
