The main transportation modes include buses, minibuses, and taxis, with most people relying on these services to travel within and between cities. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and cities, but the lack of a comprehensive transportation network can make it difficult to explore the island's more rural areas.\n\nThe government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, with a focus on upgrading roads and expanding public transportation services. However, the island's rugged terrain and limited resources can make it difficult to maintain a reliable and efficient transportation system. As a result, many locals and tourists alike often rely on taxis and private car rentals to get around, which can be more expensive but offer greater flexibility and convenience.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-$2 | $20-$30 | Good coverage of major cities and towns |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Dominica |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Connects rural areas and smaller towns |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Dominica |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2-$3 | $10-$20 | Available at airports and major towns |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available in Dominica |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To Roseau city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in major cities |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable in Dominica |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Between major cities and towns |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available in Dominica |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Dominica |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for frequent travel on public buses and minibuses.\n- Always negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, especially for longer trips.\n- Be mindful of your surroundings and keep valuables secure when using public transportation.\n- Renting a car can be a convenient option for exploring the island, but be aware of the costs and potential challenges of driving on Dominica's rugged roads.\n- Use reputable taxi services or licensed drivers to ensure a safe and reliable journey.\n- Download maps or transportation apps to help navigate the island and plan your route in advance.",
