However, the costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher rates during the peak tourist season from December to April. The electricity cost is around $0.20 per kWh, which is relatively high compared to other countries. The water supply is generally stable, but the cost can vary depending on the usage. Garbage collection services are provided by the local municipality, and the cost is included in the municipal tax.\n\nThe utility costs in Saint Martin are also affected by the island's remote location and limited resources. The electricity is generated from fossil fuels, which can lead to higher costs and environmental concerns. However, the island is taking steps to increase its renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which can help reduce the costs and environmental impact in the long run. It's also worth noting that some utility providers offer prepaid options, which can help residents and visitors manage their costs and avoid unexpected bills.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $150 | $250 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | not commonly used |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in municipal tax |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$195** | **$310** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10-20 Mbps | Orange, SFR |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 60-100 Mbps | Orange, SFR |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $20-30 | 5-10 GB | Orange, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-50 | 10-20 GB | Orange, Digicel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-120 | varies | Orange, SFR |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Saint Martin, residents and visitors can contact the local utility providers, such as EDF for electricity and SAUR for water, and provide the necessary documents, such as a rental agreement and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity options are available, which can help manage costs and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Saint Martin are Orange and SFR, which offer reliable and fast connections.\n- To save on utility bills, residents and visitors can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or walking instead of driving.\n- It's also recommended to negotiate with utility providers for the best rates, especially for long-term rentals or large properties.",
