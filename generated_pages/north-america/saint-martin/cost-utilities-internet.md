[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Saint Martin is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and garbage collection services. However, the costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher rates during the peak tourist season from December to April. The electricity cost is around $0.20 per kWh, which is relatively high compared to other countries. The water supply is generally stable, but the cost can vary depending on the usage. Garbage collection services are provided by the local municipality, and the cost is included in the municipal tax.

The utility costs in Saint Martin are also affected by the island's remote location and limited resources. The electricity is generated from fossil fuels, which can lead to higher costs and environmental concerns. However, the island is taking steps to increase its renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which can help reduce the costs and environmental impact in the long run. It's also worth noting that some utility providers offer prepaid options, which can help residents and visitors manage their costs and avoid unexpected bills.
