[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main entry point to Saint Martin is through Princess Juliana International Airport (SXM) on the Dutch side of the island, which is also known as Sint Maarten. This airport receives direct flights from major hubs in the United States, Canada, and Europe, making it a convenient option for international travelers. Grand Case-Espérance Airport (SFG) on the French side of the island also accepts flights, primarily from other Caribbean islands and some European destinations. Overland entry points are limited due to the island's geography, but visitors can arrive by ferry from neighboring islands such as Anguilla.

For those traveling from nearby islands, the overland route may involve a combination of ferry rides and taxi or bus transfers.

Direct flight hubs include Paris, Amsterdam, and major US cities like New York and Miami, offering a range of options for travelers from around the world.
