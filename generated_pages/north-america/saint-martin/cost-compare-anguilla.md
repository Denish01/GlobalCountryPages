Overall, Anguilla is around 15-20% cheaper than Saint Martin, making it a more attractive option for those looking to save money.

The economic context of the two islands also plays a role in their cost of living. Saint Martin is a French territory, and as such, it uses the Euro as its official currency. This can make it more expensive for visitors from countries that do not use the Euro, as they will need to exchange their currency and potentially pay conversion fees. Anguilla, on the other hand, uses the East Caribbean Dollar, which is pegged to the US Dollar. This makes it easier for visitors from the US and other countries that use the US Dollar to navigate and budget for their trip.
