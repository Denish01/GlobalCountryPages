[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Martin, an overseas collectivity of France located in the northeastern Caribbean, experiences a tropical climate with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity, plenty of sunshine, and gentle breezes. This period is ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and hiking. In contrast, the wet season, which spans from May to November, is marked by higher humidity, occasional rain showers, and a greater risk of hurricanes. The island's tropical climate is influenced by its location in the hurricane belt, making it essential for visitors to be aware of the weather conditions before planning their trip.

The seasons in Saint Martin have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, the island's beaches, restaurants, and attractions are bustling with visitors, and prices for accommodations and activities tend to be higher. In contrast, the wet season is generally less crowded, and visitors can often find better deals on accommodations and tours. However, the risk of hurricanes and tropical storms during this period can be a significant drawback.

The island's geography, with its rugged terrain and scenic coastline, is also affected by the seasons. During the dry season, the landscape is lush and green, with vibrant flowers and trees in bloom. In contrast, the wet season can bring heavy rainfall, which can lead to flooding and landslides in some areas. Understanding the seasons and their impact on the island is essential for planning a successful and enjoyable trip to Saint Martin.
