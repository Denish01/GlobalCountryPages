This is largely due to the fact that Saint Martin is a popular tourist destination, with a strong focus on luxury and high-end amenities. As a result, prices for everything from accommodations to dining and activities tend to be higher in Saint Martin. In contrast, Anguilla is a smaller and more laid-back island, with a lower cost of living and a more relaxed atmosphere. Overall, Anguilla is around 15-20% cheaper than Saint Martin, making it a more attractive option for those looking to save money.\n\nThe economic context of the two islands also plays a role in their cost of living. Saint Martin is a French territory, and as such, it uses the Euro as its official currency. This can make it more expensive for visitors from countries that do not use the Euro, as they will need to exchange their currency and potentially pay conversion fees. Anguilla, on the other hand, uses the East Caribbean Dollar, which is pegged to the US Dollar. This makes it easier for visitors from the US and other countries that use the US Dollar to navigate and budget for their trip.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Saint Martin (USD) | Anguilla (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 900 | 25% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 900 | 600 | 33% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% cheaper in Anguilla |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Saint Martin (USD) | Anguilla (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 25 | 20 | 20% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 800 | 600 | 25% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 4 | 20% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2.50 | 17% cheaper in Anguilla |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Saint Martin (USD) | Anguilla (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 60 | 40 | 33% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1.50 | 25% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.10 | 8% cheaper in Anguilla |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Saint Martin (USD) | Anguilla (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 40 | 20% cheaper in Anguilla |\n| Mobile Plan | 30 | 25 | 17% cheaper in Anguilla |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Saint Martin (USD) | Anguilla (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 2,000 | 1,500 | 25% |\n| Mid-Range | 3,500 | 2,500 | 29% |\n| Comfortable | 5,000 | 3,500 | 30% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Saint Martin is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end dining experiences\n  - Luxury accommodations\n  - Water sports and activities\n  - Shopping and nightlife\n- **Anguilla is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing\n  - Groceries and everyday items\n  - Transportation and fuel\n  - Utilities and internet\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor those looking for a more relaxed and affordable island experience, Anguilla is the clear winner.
