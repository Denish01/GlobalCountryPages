The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with modern hospitals and well-trained medical staff. However, the public system can be slow and bureaucratic, and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers faster and more personalized care, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the preferred option, while foreigners may prefer to use private healthcare services.\n\nFor foreigners visiting or living in Saint Martin, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in the event of a medical emergency. Many health insurance policies do not cover medical care outside of the policyholder's home country, so it is essential to check the policy details before traveling to Saint Martin. Additionally, some medical procedures may require a referral from a doctor, so it is crucial to research the healthcare system and available medical services before seeking care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Public hospitals offer lower costs, but may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$200 | $200-$500 | Private clinics offer faster appointments, but at a higher cost |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$250 | Private dental clinics offer more comprehensive services, but at a higher cost |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private optometrists offer more advanced technology, but at a higher cost |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals offer lower costs, but may have longer wait times for results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public hospitals offer lower costs, but may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$2,000 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable rooms, but at a higher cost |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Private clinics offer more advanced technology, but at a higher cost |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Private hospitals offer more personalized care, but at a higher cost |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Private clinics offer more advanced technology, but at a higher cost |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Public hospitals offer lower costs, but may have longer wait times for results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $100-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $500-$1,500 | Advanced medical procedures, specialist consultations, dental and eye care |\n| International / Expat | $1,000-$3,000 | Worldwide coverage, emergency medical evacuation, repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per prescription, depending on the type and quantity of medication.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices ranging from $5-$20 per item.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with many medications requiring a doctor's prescription before they can be dispensed.\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good, with many pharmacies located in major towns and cities.\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medication with you when traveling to Saint Martin, as availability and cost may vary.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 15, or visit the nearest hospital.
