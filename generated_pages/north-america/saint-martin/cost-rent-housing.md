[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Saint Martin is relatively small and competitive, with a high demand for apartments and houses, particularly in the city center of Marigot. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by French law, which applies to the territory. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Sint Maarten and Anguilla, Saint Martin's housing costs are relatively high, due to its popularity as a tourist destination and limited available land. The housing market in Saint Martin is also influenced by the presence of a large expat community, which contributes to the high demand for rental properties.

The rental market in Saint Martin is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional apartments and houses, with varying levels of amenities and services. Many rental properties are located in the city center, with easy access to shops, restaurants, and beaches. However, prices can be steep, and renters may need to look outside the city center to find more affordable options. The Saint Martin government has implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights, but the market remains competitive, and renters should be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property.
