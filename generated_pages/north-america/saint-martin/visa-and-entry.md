# Saint Martin Visa & Entry Requirements

You will likely need a visa or meet specific requirements to enter Saint Martin, depending on your nationality, the purpose of your visit, and the length of your stay.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Saint Martin before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Martin has a moderate visa policy, offering visa-free access to citizens of certain countries, mainly those from the European Union and other developed nations. The territory's visa policy is largely influenced by its status as an overseas collectivity of France, and as such, it follows many of the same visa rules and regulations as France. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free agreement with Saint Martin will need to obtain a visa from the French embassy or consulate in their home country before traveling to the island.

The visa policy of Saint Martin is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to promote tourism and economic development. As a result, the territory offers a range of visa options, including tourist visas, business visas, and student visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. Visitors who plan to stay in Saint Martin for an extended period or for purposes other than tourism will need to apply for a long-stay visa, which requires additional documentation and processing time.
