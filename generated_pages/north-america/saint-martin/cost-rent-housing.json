Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by French law, which applies to the territory. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Sint Maarten and Anguilla, Saint Martin's housing costs are relatively high, due to its popularity as a tourist destination and limited available land. The housing market in Saint Martin is also influenced by the presence of a large expat community, which contributes to the high demand for rental properties.\n\nThe rental market in Saint Martin is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional apartments and houses, with varying levels of amenities and services. Many rental properties are located in the city center, with easy access to shops, restaurants, and beaches. However, prices can be steep, and renters may need to look outside the city center to find more affordable options. The Saint Martin government has implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights, but the market remains competitive, and renters should be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | 800-1,200 | 600-1,000 | (typical quality, 20-30 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | 1,000-1,800 | 800-1,400 | (what to expect, 40-60 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | 1,500-3,000 | 1,200-2,500 | (family size, 80-120 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | 2,500-5,000 | 2,000-4,000 | (spacious, 150-200 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | 4,500-7,000 | (prime locations, sea views) |\n| Suburbs | 3,000-5,500 | (residential areas, 5-10 minutes from city center) |\n| Rural | 2,000-4,000 | (if applicable, countryside or beachfront) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Marigot**: the capital city, with a range of apartments and houses, from 800-2,000 USD per month, offering a lively atmosphere and easy access to amenities.\n- **Sandy Ground**: a popular neighborhood with a mix of apartments and houses, from 1,000-3,000 USD per month, known for its beautiful beach and water sports facilities.\n- **Nettle Bay**: a residential area with a range of apartments and houses, from 1,200-4,000 USD per month, offering a more relaxed atmosphere and stunning sea views.\n- **Orient Bay**: a popular neighborhood with a mix of apartments and houses, from 1,500-5,000 USD per month, known for its beautiful beach and vibrant nightlife.\n- **Terres Basses**: a luxurious neighborhood with high-end apartments and houses, from 3,000-10,000 USD per month, offering a secluded atmosphere and stunning sea views.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Saint Martin [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and prices before starting your search to ensure you find a fair deal.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property and navigate the rental process.\n- Be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property, as the rental market can be competitive.\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, if possible, to get the best deal.\n- Check the condition of the property before signing the lease, and document any existing damage to avoid potential disputes.\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment, as this can be a more convenient and cost-effective option, especially for short-term rentals.",
