[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The infrastructure in Saint Martin is characterized by a high level of development, with a strong emphasis on supporting the tourism industry, which is the main driver of the local economy. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the island's road network, improving the quality of public services, and enhancing the overall visitor experience. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with the latter often lacking access to reliable and efficient infrastructure services.

The territory's infrastructure has been impacted by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which have required significant investments in reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. Despite these challenges, the French government, as the parent country, has provided substantial support to help maintain and upgrade the island's infrastructure. The local authorities have also implemented various initiatives to promote sustainable development and reduce the territory's environmental footprint.

The overall development level of Saint Martin's infrastructure is considered to be relatively high, with a strong focus on providing high-quality services to the local population and visitors. However, there are still areas that require improvement, particularly in terms of energy and water management, where the territory is working to reduce its reliance on imported fuels and promote the use of renewable energy sources.
