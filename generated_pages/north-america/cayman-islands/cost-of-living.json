[/SECTION]\nThe Cayman Islands is considered one of the most expensive destinations in the Caribbean, with a high cost of living that is comparable to major cities in the United States. The island's strong economy, driven by finance and tourism, has led to a surge in prices for goods and services, making it challenging for travelers on a tight budget. Compared to its neighbors, such as Cuba and Jamaica, the Cayman Islands is significantly more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and activities often two to three times higher. However, the island's unique blend of Caribbean charm and modern amenities, combined with its stunning natural beauty, makes it a popular destination for travelers willing to splurge.\n\nThe high cost of living in the Cayman Islands is also driven by its remote location, which makes it reliant on imports for many goods. This, combined with a relatively small population and a lack of competition in certain industries, has led to higher prices for staples such as food and transportation. Despite these challenges, the Cayman Islands remains a popular destination for travelers and expats alike, drawn by its beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant culture.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $100-200 | Basic rooms and shared facilities, often located outside of George Town |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $250-400 | Comfortable rooms and amenities, such as pools and restaurants, in George Town or near the beach |\n| Luxury/Resort | $500-1,000 | High-end rooms and suites, often with private balconies and stunning ocean views, in top resorts |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $1,500-3,000 | One-bedroom apartments in George Town or near the beach, with prices varying depending on location and amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-20 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-40 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $50-100 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $2-5 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $5-10 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 1,000 | 1,500 | 2,500 |\n| Food | 500 | 800 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 150 | 250 | 350 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **2,050** | **3,150** | **4,950** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting during the off-season (May-October) when prices for accommodation and activities are lower.\n- Look for apartments or houses outside of George Town, which can be significantly cheaper than those in the city center.\n- Eat at local eateries or food trucks, which often serve delicious and affordable meals.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to save on taxi fares.\n- Take advantage of happy hour deals or early bird specials at restaurants and bars to save on food and drinks.\n- Avoid shopping at high-end stores or malls, and instead opt for local markets or supermarkets for souvenirs and groceries.",
