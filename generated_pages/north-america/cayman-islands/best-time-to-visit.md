# Best Time to Visit Cayman Islands — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit the Cayman Islands is from December to April, when the weather is dry and comfortable, making it ideal for outdoor activities and water sports. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Cayman Islands: December to April. Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: September to November due to the risk of hurricanes and high temperatures. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands have a tropical marine climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by high humidity and frequent rainfall, with the most significant risk of hurricanes from September to November. The climate is relatively consistent throughout the islands, with temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C) throughout the year. 

The dry season is the peak tourist season, with the highest prices and largest crowds, while the wet season is the low season, with lower prices and fewer tourists. However, the wet season can still be a good time to visit if you're looking for a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices. The islands' geography, with their **white-sand beaches** and **coral reefs**, makes them an ideal destination for water sports and outdoor activities, regardless of the season.

The seasons can significantly affect travel to the Cayman Islands. During the dry season, the islands are bustling with tourists, and popular destinations like **Seven Mile Beach** and **Stingray City** can get crowded. In contrast, the wet season is quieter, with fewer tourists and lower prices, but some outdoor activities and tourist facilities may be closed or restricted due to the weather. Understanding the seasons is essential to planning a trip to the Cayman Islands and making the most of your time on the islands.
