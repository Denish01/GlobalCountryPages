This growth can be attributed to a combination of natural increase and net migration, with many people moving to the islands for work or to escape the stresses of city life. The population is predominantly urban, with approximately 71.1% of residents living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of George Town. The islands' population is also relatively young, with a median age of 40.3 years. However, the population is expected to continue aging, which may lead to increased pressure on the healthcare and social security systems.\n\nThe Cayman Islands' population is also characterized by a high level of migration, with many residents being expatriates or foreign workers. This has contributed to the islands' cultural diversity and has helped to drive economic growth. However, it also poses challenges for the government, which must balance the needs of the local population with those of the expatriate community. The population's growth and diversity have also led to increased demands for housing, education, and healthcare, which the government is working to address through various development projects and initiatives.\n\nThe Cayman Islands' population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate, due to declining fertility rates and an aging population. To address these challenges, the government is implementing policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, improving healthcare and education, and enhancing the overall quality of life for residents. These efforts are expected to help maintain the islands' high standard of living and attract new residents and investors.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Caymanian | 57% | Local | Descendants of early settlers |\n| Jamaican | 20% | Jamaica | Many Jamaicans have migrated to the Cayman Islands for work |\n| Filipino | 8% | Philippines | Many Filipinos work in the healthcare and service sectors |\n| American | 5% | United States | Many Americans have retired or invested in the Cayman Islands |\n| British | 4% | United Kingdom | Many British citizens have moved to the Cayman Islands for work or retirement |\n| Indian | 2% | India | Many Indians work in the financial and technology sectors |\n| Other | 4% | Various | Includes people from other Caribbean islands, Latin America, and other parts of the world |\n\nThe Cayman Islands are a culturally diverse territory, with a mix of ethnic groups that reflect the islands' history and geography.
