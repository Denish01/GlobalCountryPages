Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Cayman Islands' Rent Law, which requires landlords to provide a written tenancy agreement and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Cuba and Jamaica, the Cayman Islands' housing costs are significantly higher, reflecting the territory's high standard of living and strong economy.\n\nThe housing market in Cayman Islands is also influenced by the territory's **tourism industry**, which drives up demand for short-term rentals and vacation properties. As a result, long-term renters may face competition from tourists and investors, which can drive up prices and reduce the availability of affordable housing options. However, the Cayman Islands government has implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights, including the establishment of a **rent tribunal** to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,200-$1,800 | $900-$1,400 | (typical quality, 300-400 sqft) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,500-$2,500 | $1,200-$2,000 | (what to expect, 600-800 sqft) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | (family size, 1,000-1,200 sqft) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $3,500-$5,500 | $2,800-$4,000 | (spacious, 1,500-1,800 sqft) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $5,000-$8,000 | (prime locations, such as George Town) |\n| Suburbs | $3,000-$5,000 | (residential areas, such as West Bay) |\n| Rural | $2,000-$3,000 | (less developed areas, such as East End) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **George Town**: $2,000-$4,000 USD per month, urban amenities and easy access to work and entertainment\n- **Seven Mile Beach**: $2,500-$5,000 USD per month, beachfront properties and resort amenities\n- **West Bay**: $1,800-$3,000 USD per month, family-friendly neighborhoods and easy access to schools\n- **Savannah**: $1,500-$2,500 USD per month, suburban living with a mix of residential and commercial areas\n- **Bodden Town**: $1,200-$2,000 USD per month, historic town with a mix of old and new properties\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Cayman Islands [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and properties thoroughly before signing a lease to ensure you find a **safe and suitable** location\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to **avoid scams** and ensure a smooth rental process\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, especially for longer-term rentals, to get the **best value** for your money\n- Be prepared to pay a security deposit and first month's rent upfront, and **budget for utilities** and other expenses\n- Consider renting a **furnished** apartment, which can be more convenient and cost-effective, especially for short-term rentals\n- **Read reviews** and check the property's condition before signing a lease to avoid any potential issues or disputes with the landlord",
