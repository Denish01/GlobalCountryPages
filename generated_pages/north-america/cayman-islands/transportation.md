[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands are easily accessible by air, with Owen Roberts International Airport (GCM) being the main entry point. The airport is located on the island of Grand Cayman and receives direct flights from major hubs such as Miami, New York, and London. You can also fly into Charles Kirkconnell International Airport (CYB) on the island of Cayman Brac, although this airport is smaller and has fewer direct flights. There are no overland entry points to the Cayman Islands, as they are an island territory.

If you're planning to visit the Cayman Islands from nearby islands such as Jamaica or Cuba, you can take a connecting flight or a ferry. However, please note that ferry services may be limited and not always available. It's best to check with the ferry operator or a travel agent for the latest schedules and fares. Additionally, if you're traveling from the United States, you can take a direct flight from cities such as Miami, New York, or Chicago.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The domestic air network in the Cayman Islands is limited, with only a few flights operating between the islands. Cayman Airways is the main domestic airline, offering flights between Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac, and Little Cayman. The flights are relatively short, taking around 10-15 minutes, and can be booked in advance through the airline's website or at the airport. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 USD per person, depending on the time of year and availability. It's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands do not have a rail network, so you won't be able to take a train to get around. This is due to the small size of the islands and the limited demand for rail transportation. As a result, you'll need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to get around.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands have a public bus system that operates on all three islands. The buses are relatively frequent, with routes connecting major towns and tourist areas. You can pay the fare in cash, which is around $2-3 USD per ride, or purchase a weekly pass for around $20-30 USD. The buses are a convenient and affordable way to get around, especially for short distances. Additionally, there are private coach services available for group tours or charters, which can be booked in advance.
