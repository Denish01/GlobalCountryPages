  "content": "To get around in the Cayman Islands, you can use a variety of transportation options, including taxis, buses, and rental cars, as well as take domestic flights or use ride-hailing apps.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Owen Roberts International Airport, GCM\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe Cayman Islands are easily accessible by air, with Owen Roberts International Airport (GCM) being the main entry point. The airport is located on the island of Grand Cayman and receives direct flights from major hubs such as Miami, New York, and London. You can also fly into Charles Kirkconnell International Airport (CYB) on the island of Cayman Brac, although this airport is smaller and has fewer direct flights. There are no overland entry points to the Cayman Islands, as they are an island territory.\n\nIf you're planning to visit the Cayman Islands from nearby islands such as Jamaica or Cuba, you can take a connecting flight or a ferry. However, please note that ferry services may be limited and not always available. It's best to check with the ferry operator or a travel agent for the latest schedules and fares. Additionally, if you're traveling from the United States, you can take a direct flight from cities such as Miami, New York, or Chicago.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in the Cayman Islands is limited, with only a few flights operating between the islands. Cayman Airways is the main domestic airline, offering flights between Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac, and Little Cayman. The flights are relatively short, taking around 10-15 minutes, and can be booked in advance through the airline's website or at the airport. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 USD per person, depending on the time of year and availability. It's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThe Cayman Islands do not have a rail network, so you won't be able to take a train to get around. This is due to the small size of the islands and the limited demand for rail transportation. As a result, you'll need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThe Cayman Islands have a public bus system that operates on all three islands. The buses are relatively frequent, with routes connecting major towns and tourist areas. You can pay the fare in cash, which is around $2-3 USD per ride, or purchase a weekly pass for around $20-30 USD. The buses are a convenient and affordable way to get around, especially for short distances. Additionally, there are private coach services available for group tours or charters, which can be booked in advance.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | George Town, West Bay | $2-3 | Frequent routes, cash only |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $10-20/km | Available at airports and towns |\n| Ride-Hailing | George Town, Seven Mile Beach | $10-20 | Local alternatives, such as Cayman Taxi |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Not available | - | Not available in the Cayman Islands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in the Cayman Islands, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, which is valid for up to six months.\n- The road conditions in the Cayman Islands are generally good, with paved roads and clear signage.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, with prices around $1.50-2.00 USD per liter.\n- Car rental companies are available at the airports and in major towns, with prices starting from around $40-60 USD per day.\n- When driving, be aware of the **left-hand traffic** rule and **speed limits**, which are strictly enforced.\n- Be cautious of **pedestrian traffic** and **cyclists**, especially in tourist areas.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced taxi fares or fake tour operators.\n- Use **cash** or **credit cards** to pay for transportation, as not all providers accept **debit cards**.\n- Download **local apps**, such as Cayman Taxi, to book ride-hailing services or taxis.\n- Always **wear a seatbelt** and follow **traffic rules** to ensure your safety.\n- Be mindful of **parking restrictions** and **fees**, especially in George Town and tourist areas.\n- Consider purchasing **travel insurance** that covers transportation accidents or delays.\n- Research **transportation options** in advance to plan your itinerary and budget accordingly.\n- Don't forget to **tip** your drivers or tour operators for good service, as this is customary in the Cayman Islands.",
