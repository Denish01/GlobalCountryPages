[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands offer a range of transportation options, including public buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with an extensive network of buses connecting major towns and cities. However, most people get around by car, as the islands have a well-developed road network and plenty of parking options. The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in rural areas can make it difficult for those without cars to get around, but the government is working to improve the situation.

The main transportation modes in the Cayman Islands are private cars, taxis, and buses. The islands have a relatively small population, and as a result, traffic congestion is not a significant issue. The roads are generally well-maintained, and the scenic coastal routes make for a pleasant driving experience. The government has also implemented initiatives to promote sustainable transportation, such as encouraging the use of electric vehicles and improving cycling infrastructure.
