[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands are situated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, approximately 460 miles south of Miami, Florida. They are part of the Greater Antilles, a group of islands that also includes Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. The islands are surrounded by the Caribbean Sea to the south, west, and north, and the Cayman Trench, a deep-sea trench, lies to the south. The Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Territory, with George Town as the capital and largest city, located on the western coast of Grand Cayman.

The Cayman Islands share maritime borders with Cuba to the north and northwest, and Jamaica to the southeast. The closest point to the United States is the western tip of Cuba, which is about 90 miles from the easternmost point of the Cayman Islands. The islands are also close to the **Mesoamerican Reef**, the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, which provides a habitat for a diverse array of marine life.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands are generally flat, with no major mountains or rivers. The highest point, **The Bluff**, is located on Cayman Brac, which is the second-largest island. The Bluff is a limestone ridge that runs along the eastern coast of the island, with a maximum elevation of 43 meters. Grand Cayman, the largest island, is also relatively flat, with a few small hills and valleys. Little Cayman, the smallest island, is a low-lying coral island with no significant elevations.

The coastline of the Cayman Islands is characterized by white sandy beaches, coral reefs, and crystal-clear waters. The islands are surrounded by a coral reef system, which provides excellent opportunities for **scuba diving** and **snorkeling**. The interior of the islands is covered with mangrove forests, wetlands, and dry forests, which are home to a variety of flora and fauna. The Cayman Islands are also known for their **beaches**, which are considered some of the most beautiful in the Caribbean.

The geology of the Cayman Islands is primarily composed of limestone, which is a result of the islands' coral reef origin. The limestone is soluble, which has led to the formation of **caves** and **sinkholes** throughout the islands. The Cayman Islands are also subject to **hurricanes**, which can have a significant impact on the islands' geography and ecosystem.
