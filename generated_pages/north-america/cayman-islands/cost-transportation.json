  "content": "The cost of transportation in Cayman Islands can vary, but on average, a monthly transit pass costs around $120 USD, while a taxi start rate is approximately $3 USD, and fuel costs around $1.30 USD per liter.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($120 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($3 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.30 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (Yes — Uber, Lyft)\nCurrency: KYD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Cayman Islands offer a range of transportation options, including public buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with an extensive network of buses connecting major towns and cities. However, most people get around by car, as the islands have a well-developed road network and plenty of parking options. The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in rural areas can make it difficult for those without cars to get around, but the government is working to improve the situation.\n\nThe main transportation modes in the Cayman Islands are private cars, taxis, and buses. The islands have a relatively small population, and as a result, traffic congestion is not a significant issue. The roads are generally well-maintained, and the scenic coastal routes make for a pleasant driving experience. The government has also implemented initiatives to promote sustainable transportation, such as encouraging the use of electric vehicles and improving cycling infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2.50 | $120 | Extensive network, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used for short distances |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3 | $2 | $10-$15 | Available at airports and major towns |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.50 | $1.50 | $10-$15 | Uber and Lyft available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.30 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.40 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in busy areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited services, mainly between Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route between Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or using ride-hailing services.\n- Use the **Cayman Islands Public Transport** app to plan your route and track bus schedules.\n- Always negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting your journey.\n- Be aware of **peak hour** traffic congestion in major towns and plan your journey accordingly.\n- Consider renting a car for a day or two to explore the islands, but be aware of **parking limitations** in busy areas.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing services to ensure your safety, especially at night.",
