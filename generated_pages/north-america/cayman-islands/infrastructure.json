  "content": "The Cayman Islands have a well-developed infrastructure, with a strong focus on providing modern amenities and services to its population of 84,738 people, while also catering to a large tourism industry.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 85%\nRoad Network: 785 km, well-maintained\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Cayman Islands have a high standard of infrastructure development, with a strong emphasis on providing reliable and efficient services to its population and visitors. Recent investments have focused on upgrading and expanding the islands' transportation networks, energy generation, and telecommunications systems. However, there is a notable urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with the capital city George Town and the surrounding areas being more developed than the rural areas. The government has been working to address this disparity through targeted investments and development projects.\n\nThe Cayman Islands' infrastructure has been shaped by its history as a British territory, with many of its systems and institutions modeled on those of the United Kingdom. The islands have a well-developed financial sector, with many international banks and financial institutions having a presence on the islands. This has driven the development of modern infrastructure, including high-quality office buildings, telecommunications networks, and transportation systems.\n\nDespite the high standard of infrastructure development, the Cayman Islands face some challenges, including a reliance on imported fuel for energy generation and a need to improve the resilience of its infrastructure to natural disasters such as hurricanes. The government has been working to address these challenges through investments in renewable energy and infrastructure resilience.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 785 km | Good | Well-maintained, with a focus on safety and efficiency |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network on the islands |\n| Airports | 3 international, 0 domestic | Good | Modern airports with good facilities and services |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | Well-equipped ports with good cargo handling facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\nThe transportation network in the Cayman Islands is well-developed, with a focus on providing efficient and safe services to residents and visitors. The road network is extensive and well-maintained, with a strong emphasis on safety and efficiency. The islands have three international airports, including Owen Roberts International Airport, which provides connections to major hubs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The Cayman Islands rely heavily on imported fuel for energy generation, with a focus on diesel and gas turbines.\n- The islands have a well-developed energy infrastructure, with a reliable and efficient supply of electricity to homes and businesses.\n- The government has been working to promote the use of renewable energy, including solar and wind power, to reduce the islands' reliance on imported fuel.\n- Energy efficiency is a key priority, with a focus on reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of energy-efficient technologies.\n- The Cayman Islands have a goal of generating 70% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030, as part of their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- The Cayman Islands have a well-developed water supply system, with a reliable and efficient supply of clean water to homes and businesses.\n- The islands have a high level of sanitation coverage, with modern sewage systems and wastewater treatment facilities.\n- Tap water is safe to drink, and the government has implemented measures to protect the islands' water resources from pollution and contamination.\n- The Cayman Islands have a strong focus on water conservation, with initiatives to reduce water consumption and promote the use of water-efficient technologies.\n- The government has implemented measures to improve access to water and sanitation in rural areas, including the development of new water supply systems and the upgrading of existing infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- The Cayman Islands have a well-developed telecommunications network, with a high level of internet penetration and mobile phone coverage.\n- The islands have a modern and efficient telecommunications infrastructure, with a focus on providing fast and reliable services to residents and businesses.\n- The government has been working to promote the use of **broadband** and **fiber-optic** technologies, to support the development of the digital economy.\n- The Cayman Islands have a strong focus on **cybersecurity**, with measures in place to protect against cyber threats and promote online safety.\n- The islands have a well-developed postal service, with a reliable and efficient delivery of mail and packages.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Cayman Islands have a number of major infrastructure development projects underway, including the expansion of Owen Roberts International Airport and the development of a new cruise ship terminal.\n- The government has announced plans to invest in the development of renewable energy, including the construction of a new solar farm and the promotion of energy-efficient technologies.\n- The Cayman Islands have a strong focus on **sustainable development**, with measures in place to reduce the islands' environmental impact and promote sustainable tourism practices.\n- The government has implemented measures to improve the resilience of the islands' infrastructure to natural disasters, including the development of new flood protection systems and the upgrading of existing infrastructure.\n- The Cayman Islands have a goal of becoming a **carbon-neutral** destination by 2050, as part of their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.",
