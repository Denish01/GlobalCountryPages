  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Cayman Islands can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with private healthcare generally being more expensive, but also often providing better quality and more comprehensive care. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $4,419 (calculated from GDP per capita PPP)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: No specific data available\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: KYD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Cayman Islands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, but it can be slow and may not offer the same level of specialized care as private providers. Locals and foreigners can access both public and private healthcare services, but foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance to access private care. The public healthcare system is primarily funded through government subsidies and patient fees, while private healthcare is funded through patient fees and private insurance. \n\nIn terms of accessing healthcare services, locals are generally entitled to subsidized public healthcare, while foreigners may need to purchase private insurance or pay out-of-pocket for services. Many employers in the Cayman Islands offer private health insurance as part of their employee benefits package, which can help to cover the cost of private healthcare. However, for those who are not employed or who are self-employed, purchasing private insurance can be expensive. It is recommended that foreigners and locals alike consider purchasing private health insurance to access better quality and more comprehensive care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$100 | $150-$300 | Public clinics may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$250 | $250-$500 | Private specialists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Dental Checkup | $75-$150 | $150-$300 | Private dentists may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private labs may offer faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $200-$500 | Public hospital may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $2,000-$5,000 | Private hospitals may have more advanced equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,500-$5,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive prenatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Private imaging centers may offer faster turnaround times |\n| X-Ray | $100-$300 | Private imaging centers may have more advanced equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $100-$300 | Public hospital care, GP visits, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $300-$1,000 | Private hospital care, specialist visits, advanced procedures |\n| International / Expat | $500-$2,000 | Global coverage, including US and European care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per prescription, depending on the type and quantity of medication\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices similar to those in the US\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked and offer a wide range of medications, including brand-name and generic options\n- Prescription rules are generally similar to those in the US, with some medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Many pharmacies offer online ordering and delivery services, making it convenient to access medication from home\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts or loyalty programs for frequent customers, which can help to reduce costs\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended that you call 911 or visit the emergency room at the Cayman Islands Hospital.

These facilities may have international accreditation and may be more familiar with the needs of foreign patients.
