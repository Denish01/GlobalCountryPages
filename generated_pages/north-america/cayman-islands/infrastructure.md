[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands have a high standard of infrastructure development, with a strong emphasis on providing reliable and efficient services to its population and visitors. Recent investments have focused on upgrading and expanding the islands' transportation networks, energy generation, and telecommunications systems. However, there is a notable urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with the capital city George Town and the surrounding areas being more developed than the rural areas. The government has been working to address this disparity through targeted investments and development projects.

The Cayman Islands' infrastructure has been shaped by its history as a British territory, with many of its systems and institutions modeled on those of the United Kingdom. The islands have a well-developed financial sector, with many international banks and financial institutions having a presence on the islands. This has driven the development of modern infrastructure, including high-quality office buildings, telecommunications networks, and transportation systems.

Despite the high standard of infrastructure development, the Cayman Islands face some challenges, including a reliance on imported fuel for energy generation and a need to improve the resilience of its infrastructure to natural disasters such as hurricanes. The government has been working to address these challenges through investments in renewable energy and infrastructure resilience.
