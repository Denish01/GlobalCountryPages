[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Cayman Islands' political system is based on the Westminster model, with a separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive branch is headed by the premier, who is responsible for advising the governor on the exercise of the royal prerogative. The legislative assembly is a unicameral body, composed of 19 members, who are elected by universal adult suffrage for a term of four years. The judicial branch is independent and impartial, with a court system that is based on the common law of England.

The Cayman Islands' political system is characterized by a high level of stability and a strong tradition of democratic governance. The country has a well-established system of checks and balances, which ensures that power is distributed evenly between the different branches of government. The legislative assembly is responsible for making laws, while the executive branch is responsible for implementing them. The judicial branch provides a check on the other two branches, ensuring that they act in accordance with the law.

The Cayman Islands' political system is also characterized by a strong sense of community and a high level of civic engagement. The country has a relatively small population, which makes it easy for citizens to participate in the political process and to hold their elected representatives accountable. The country also has a well-developed system of civil society, with a large number of non-governmental organizations and community groups that play an active role in promoting social and economic development.
