Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: September to November due to the risk of hurricanes and high temperatures. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Cayman Islands have a tropical marine climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by high humidity and frequent rainfall, with the most significant risk of hurricanes from September to November. The climate is relatively consistent throughout the islands, with temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C) throughout the year. \n\nThe dry season is the peak tourist season, with the highest prices and largest crowds, while the wet season is the low season, with lower prices and fewer tourists. However, the wet season can still be a good time to visit if you're looking for a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices. The islands' geography, with their **white-sand beaches** and **coral reefs**, makes them an ideal destination for water sports and outdoor activities, regardless of the season.\n\nThe seasons can significantly affect travel to the Cayman Islands. During the dry season, the islands are bustling with tourists, and popular destinations like **Seven Mile Beach** and **Stingray City** can get crowded. In contrast, the wet season is quieter, with fewer tourists and lower prices, but some outdoor activities and tourist facilities may be closed or restricted due to the weather. Understanding the seasons is essential to planning a trip to the Cayman Islands and making the most of your time on the islands.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Sunny, 78°F (25°C) | Med | $$ | Snorkeling, diving |\n| February | Sunny, 80°F (27°C) | Med | $$ | Beach activities, water sports |\n| March | Sunny, 82°F (28°C) | High | $$$ | Spring break, festivals |\n| April | Sunny, 84°F (29°C) | High | $$$ | Easter celebrations, outdoor activities |\n| May | Partly cloudy, 86°F (30°C) | Low | $ | Nature reserves, bird-watching |\n| June | Partly cloudy, 88°F (31°C) | Low | $ | Fishing, boat tours |\n| July | Rainy, 90°F (32°C) | Low | $ | Cultural events, local festivals |\n| August | Rainy, 90°F (32°C) | Low | $ | Family activities, summer camps |\n| September | Rainy, 88°F (31°C) | Low | $ | Hurricane season, avoid |\n| October | Partly cloudy, 86°F (30°C) | Low | $ | Outdoor activities, nature reserves |\n| November | Partly cloudy, 84°F (29°C) | Med | $$ | Thanksgiving celebrations, pre-holiday season |\n| December | Sunny, 82°F (28°C) | High | $$$ | Christmas celebrations, New Year's Eve |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cayman Islands Pirates Week | November | A week-long festival with pirate-themed activities, food, and music |\n| Cayman Islands International Film Festival | December | A showcase of local and international films, with workshops and panels |\n| Cayman Jazz Fest | December | A music festival featuring jazz and other genres, with local and international artists |\n| Cayman Islands Marathon | December | A running event with full and half marathons, as well as a 5K and fun run |\n| Cayman Food and Wine Festival | April | A culinary event with food and wine tastings, cooking demonstrations, and live music |\n| Cayman Islands Carnival | May | A cultural celebration with parades, music, and dance performances |\n| Cayman Brac Island Festival | August | A community festival with music, food, and activities, showcasing the island's culture and heritage |\n| Little Cayman Island Festival | October | A small-scale festival with music, food, and activities, highlighting the island's natural beauty |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The western part of Grand Cayman Island, including **Seven Mile Beach**, tends to be more developed and crowded, especially during the peak season.\n- The eastern part of Grand Cayman Island, including **Rum Point** and **Kaibo**, is more laid-back and natural, with fewer tourists and lower prices.\n- Cayman Brac Island is known for its **diving and snorkeling** opportunities, with a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices than Grand Cayman.\n- Little Cayman Island is the smallest and most secluded of the three islands, with a focus on **nature reserves** and **ecotourism**.\n- The **East End** of Grand Cayman Island is a quieter area, with fewer tourists and more natural attractions, such as the **Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park**.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and limited availability.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to May or from November to December, for lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack **lightweight and breathable clothing**, as well as **sunscreen and insect repellent**, to protect yourself from the sun and insects.\n- Be aware of the **hurricane season**, which runs from June to November, and plan your trip accordingly.\n- Take advantage of the **islands' natural beauty** by engaging in outdoor activities, such as snorkeling, diving, or hiking, and exploring the **nature reserves** and **parks**.\n- Respect the **local culture** and environment by following sustainable tourism practices and supporting local businesses and initiatives.",
