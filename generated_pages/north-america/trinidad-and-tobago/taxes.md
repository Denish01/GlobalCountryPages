[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Trinidad and Tobago operates on a **territorial taxation** system, where only income earned within the country is subject to tax, regardless of the taxpayer's residency status. However, residents are also taxed on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must have a permanent home in Trinidad and Tobago, or have been present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year. Non-residents are taxed only on their Trinidad and Tobago-sourced income.

The tax system in Trinidad and Tobago is governed by the Income Tax Act and the Value Added Tax Act, which provide the framework for the taxation of individuals and businesses. The tax authority, the Board of Inland Revenue, is responsible for administering and enforcing tax laws, as well as providing guidance and support to taxpayers. The tax year in Trinidad and Tobago runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of April of the following year.
