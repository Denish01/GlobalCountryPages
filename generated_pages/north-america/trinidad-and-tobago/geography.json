The country is composed of two main islands, Trinidad and Tobago, which are separated by a 32-kilometer stretch of water. The country is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, with the Gulf of Paria to the west. Trinidad and Tobago shares maritime borders with several countries, including Venezuela to the south, Grenada to the north, and Barbados to the east.\n\nThe country's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region. The islands are also situated near several major shipping lanes, making them a key stopover point for international trade. The country's proximity to the South American mainland has also influenced its cultural and historical development, with many indigenous and colonial-era influences still evident in its architecture, cuisine, and traditions.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nTrinidad and Tobago's terrain is characterized by a mix of rugged mountains, rolling hills, and coastal plains. The island of Trinidad is the larger of the two islands, with a diverse landscape that includes the **Northern Range**, a mountain chain that runs along the northern coast, and the **Central Range**, a series of hills and valleys that stretch across the center of the island. The island of Tobago is smaller and more compact, with a rugged terrain that includes the **Main Ridge**, a mountain range that runs along the center of the island.\n\nThe country's coastline is marked by a variety of beaches, bays, and coves, with the most popular beaches found on the northern and western coasts of Trinidad and the western coast of Tobago. The islands are also home to several major rivers, including the **Orinoco River**, which forms part of the border with Venezuela, and the **Caroni River**, which flows through the central part of Trinidad. The country's interior is covered in lush tropical rainforest, with many areas protected as national parks and wildlife reserves.\n\nThe unique geology of Trinidad and Tobago has created a number of distinctive landscapes, including the **Pitch Lake**, a large lake of asphalt that is found in the southwestern part of Trinidad. The lake is a popular tourist attraction and is believed to have been formed as a result of the geological activity in the area. The country's diverse terrain and landscape have also created a wide range of ecosystems, supporting a rich and varied array of flora and fauna.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dry Season | January to May | 22-30°C | low | dry and sunny |\n| Wet Season | June to December | 23-32°C | high | hot and humid |\n| Hurricane Season | June to November | 23-32°C | high | risk of hurricanes and tropical storms |\n| Winter | December to February | 20-28°C | low | cool and dry |\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: January to May.
