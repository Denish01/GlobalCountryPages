[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Trinidad and Tobago has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C. This is the best time to visit the islands, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, birdwatching, and beachgoing. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. However, the wet season is also the time when the islands are at their most lush and green, and some visitors may find the scenery particularly beautiful during this time.

The climate in Trinidad and Tobago is also influenced by the trade winds, which bring a cooling breeze to the islands. The trade winds are strongest during the dry season, making the weather feel even more pleasant. The islands are also susceptible to hurricanes, which can occur during the wet season. Visitors should be aware of the hurricane risk and plan their trip accordingly.

The seasons in Trinidad and Tobago have a significant impact on travel, as the weather can affect the availability of certain activities and attractions. For example, during the wet season, some hiking trails may be closed due to flooding, and the beaches may be less crowded. On the other hand, the dry season is the peak tourist season, and popular attractions may be more crowded.
