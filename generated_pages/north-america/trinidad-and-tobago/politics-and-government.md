[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Trinidad and Tobago is based on the principles of **separation of powers**, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches operating independently. The **parliamentary system** is characterized by a **prime minister** as the head of government, who is accountable to the **House of Representatives**, the lower house of parliament. The **president** serves as the head of state, but has limited powers and plays a largely ceremonial role. The **Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago** outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the branches.

The government is unitary, with a central authority that exercises control over the entire country. However, there are **regional corporations** that have some degree of autonomy and are responsible for providing local services such as water and sanitation, and road maintenance. The **local government system** is based on a network of municipalities and regional corporations, which are responsible for delivering services to citizens.

The **separation of powers** is designed to provide checks and balances on the exercise of power, and to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful. The **judicial branch** plays a critical role in this system, as it is responsible for interpreting the constitution and ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the law.
