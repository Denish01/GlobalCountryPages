[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The British Virgin Islands have a high standard of living and a relatively well-developed infrastructure, with a strong focus on tourism and financial services. The territory has invested heavily in recent years to improve its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, upgrading of airports and ports, and the development of renewable energy sources. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with rural areas often having poorer quality roads and limited access to certain services. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities and promote more equitable development across the territory.

The British Virgin Islands' infrastructure has been shaped by its history as a British colony and its current status as a British overseas territory. The territory has a high level of **economic development**, with a strong focus on financial services and tourism. As a result, the infrastructure is geared towards supporting these industries, with a high-quality **road network** and well-developed **port facilities**.
