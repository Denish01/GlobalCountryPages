The system consists of primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with 12 years of compulsory education. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality can vary, with some schools facing challenges in terms of resources and infrastructure. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significant cost. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.\n\nThe quality of education in British Virgin Islands is generally good, with a literacy rate of around 95%. However, there are some challenges, particularly in terms of access to education for disadvantaged groups. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the education system, including the introduction of new curriculum and the provision of training for teachers. Despite these efforts, there is still a need for improvement, particularly in terms of resources and infrastructure. For expats, international schools are a popular option, offering a range of curricula and a high quality of education.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary, with some schools facing challenges in terms of resources and infrastructure |\n| Private Primary | $5,000-$10,000 | Range by tier, with top-tier schools offering higher quality facilities and teaching |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary, with some schools facing challenges in terms of resources and infrastructure |\n| Private Secondary | $8,000-$15,000 | Range by tier, with top-tier schools offering higher quality facilities and teaching |\n| International School | $12,000-$20,000 | Curriculum types include International Baccalaureate, British GCSE, and US-based curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $2,000-$5,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Limited options available, with most students opting to study abroad |\n| Private University | $8,000-$15,000 | $10,000-$20,000 | Range by institution, with top-tier universities offering higher quality facilities and teaching |\n| Top-Ranked University | $10,000-$20,000 | $15,000-$30,000 | H.
