[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The British Virgin Islands have a tropical climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity, gentle breezes, and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by higher humidity, occasional rain showers, and a higher risk of hurricanes. The islands are located in the hurricane belt and are susceptible to these powerful storms, which can bring strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas.

The climate in the British Virgin Islands is influenced by the trade winds, which blow from the northeast and bring cool, dry air to the islands. The temperature remains relatively consistent throughout the year, with average highs ranging from 84°F (29°C) in January to 90°F (32°C) in August. The sea temperature is also warm, ranging from 78°F (25°C) in February to 82°F (28°C) in October, making it perfect for swimming, snorkeling, and diving.

The seasons have a significant impact on travel to the British Virgin Islands. During the peak season, which coincides with the dry season, the islands are bustling with tourists, and prices for accommodations and activities are at their highest. In contrast, the budget season, which runs from May to November, offers lower prices and fewer crowds, but the risk of hurricanes and rain showers increases.
