[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The British Virgin Islands have a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most households having access to electricity, water, and garbage collection services. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on usage and seasonal variation. During the peak tourist season, which runs from December to April, utility costs may be higher due to increased demand. Additionally, the territory's remote location and limited natural resources can drive up the cost of electricity and water production.

The British Virgin Islands have a relatively stable utility cost environment, with prices remaining steady over the past few years. However, the territory is susceptible to external factors such as global fuel prices and natural disasters, which can impact utility costs. The government has implemented measures to promote energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, which may help to stabilize utility costs in the long term. The education sector, which accounts for 3.2% of the GDP, may also have an indirect impact on the overall cost of living, including utilities.
