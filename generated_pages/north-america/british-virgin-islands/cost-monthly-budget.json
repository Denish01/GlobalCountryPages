The GDP per capita (PPP) is around $43,366, which is one of the highest in the region. However, this also means that the standard of living is high, with good infrastructure, modern amenities, and a relatively low crime rate. A budget of $2,500 per month would allow for a basic lifestyle, with shared accommodation and limited social activities, while a mid-range budget of $4,000 per month would provide a more comfortable lifestyle, with a one-bedroom apartment in the center of Road Town and a moderate social life. A comfortable budget of $6,500 per month would allow for a luxurious lifestyle, with a two-bedroom apartment in a desirable area and frequent dining out and social activities.\n\nCompared to neighboring countries, the British Virgin Islands is more expensive than the US Virgin Islands, but less expensive than some of the more upscale Caribbean islands, such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. However, the cost of living in the British Virgin Islands is still relatively high, and visitors and expats should be prepared for higher prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The local currency is the US dollar, which makes it easy for visitors from the US to navigate the local economy.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 800 | 1,200 | 2,500 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 500 | 800 | 1,200 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 100 | 200 | 500 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 150 | 250 | 400 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 100 | 200 | 500 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 200 | 400 | 800 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 100 | 200 | 400 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 500 | 800 | 1,500 | |\n| **Total** | **2,550** | **4,150** | **7,500** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nAt the budget level of $2,500 per month, daily life in the British Virgin Islands would be relatively simple.
