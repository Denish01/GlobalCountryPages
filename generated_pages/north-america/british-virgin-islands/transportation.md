[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The British Virgin Islands are accessible by air and sea, with the main entry point being the Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport, located on Beef Island, which is connected to Tortola by a bridge. The airport receives direct flights from major hubs such as San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands, as well as connecting flights from other Caribbean islands and the United States. You can also reach the British Virgin Islands by ferry from nearby islands, including the US Virgin Islands and St. Maarten.

For those traveling by sea, the Road Town harbor on Tortola is a major entry point, with ferries and charter boats arriving from surrounding islands. The British Virgin Islands are also a popular destination for sailors and yachters, with many marinas and anchorages available throughout the territory. Overland entry points are limited, as the British Virgin Islands are an archipelago, but you can travel by ferry or private boat from neighboring islands.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The domestic air network in the British Virgin Islands is limited, with most flights connecting the main islands of Tortola, Virgin Gorda, and Anegada. The main domestic airline is **VI Airlink**, which operates regular flights between these islands, as well as charter flights to other destinations in the Caribbean. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 per person, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in the British Virgin Islands, as the territory's small size and island geography make it unsuitable for train travel. As a result, other modes of transportation, such as ferries, taxis, and car rentals, are more commonly used to get around the islands.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
The British Virgin Islands have a limited public bus system, with most buses operating on Tortola and connecting major towns and villages. The buses are not always reliable, and schedules can be irregular, so it's often better to use taxis or rent a car to get around. There are no coach services connecting the British Virgin Islands to other countries or territories.
