        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Saint Lucia is an island nation located in the eastern Caribbean Sea, with a rich and diverse history dating back to the pre-Columbian era. The island was first inhabited by the <strong>Arawak</strong> people, an indigenous tribe that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1502, Christopher Columbus sighted the island on his fourth voyage to the New World. The French were the first Europeans to establish a settlement on the island in 1659, and they named it Saint Lucia in honor of Saint Lucy.</p>
        <p>The British and French disputed control of the island throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, with the British eventually gaining control in 1814. During this period, the island's economy was primarily based on <strong>sugar production</strong>, with African slaves being brought to the island to work on plantations. The British abolished slavery in 1834, and the island became a <strong>crown colony</strong> in 1838. Saint Lucia gained <strong>internal self-government</strong> in 1967 and eventually achieved <strong>independence</strong> from the United Kingdom on February 22, 1979.</p>
        <p>The island's history has been shaped by its strategic location in the Caribbean, with the British using it as a military base during the 18th and 19th centuries. The island's <strong>geography</strong> has also played a significant role in its development, with its rugged terrain and volcanic peaks making it difficult to establish large-scale agriculture. Despite these challenges, the island has developed a diverse economy based on <strong>tourism</strong>, <strong>agriculture</strong>, and <strong>manufacturing</strong>.</p>
        <p>The island's cultural heritage is a unique blend of African, European, and indigenous influences, with the majority of the population being of <strong>African descent</strong>. The official language is <strong>English</strong>, but a <strong>Creole</strong> dialect is also widely spoken. The island's capital, <strong>Castries</strong>, is a bustling city with a rich history and culture, and is home to many of the island's main attractions, including the <strong>Castries Market</strong> and the <strong>Saint Lucia Cathedral</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Saint Lucia is a small, uninhabited island."</p>

        <p>Reality: Saint Lucia has a relatively low crime rate compared to other Caribbean islands, and the government has implemented various initiatives to ensure tourist safety. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "The island's economy is solely based on tourism."</p>
        <p>Reality: While tourism is a significant contributor to the island's economy, the island also has a growing <strong>manufacturing sector</strong>, as well as a <strong>agricultural sector</strong> that produces a range of crops, including <strong>bananas</strong> and <strong>coconuts</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "The island's culture is solely African."</p>
        <p>Reality: The island's culture is a unique blend of African, European, and indigenous influences, with a strong emphasis on <strong>Creole</strong> traditions and customs. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "The island is not environmentally conscious."</p>
        <p>Reality: Saint Lucia has implemented various initiatives to protect its natural environment, including the establishment of <strong>national parks</strong> and <strong>nature reserves</strong>, and has been recognized for its efforts to reduce <strong>carbon emissions</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <h2>Challenges & Context</h2>
