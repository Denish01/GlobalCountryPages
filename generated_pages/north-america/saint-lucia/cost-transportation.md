[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Lucia is a small island nation with a relatively well-developed transportation system, making it easy to get around. The main transportation modes in Saint Lucia include buses, taxis, and rental cars. The public transit system is decent, with buses covering most areas of the island, but the quality of the roads can be a challenge, especially in rural areas. Most people in Saint Lucia rely on buses and taxis to get around, as they are affordable and widely available. However, many tourists prefer to rent cars to explore the island at their own pace.

The island's scenic roads and stunning landscapes make driving a pleasure, but it's essential to be aware of the local driving customs and road conditions. The capital city, Castries, is the hub of the transportation network, with buses and taxis connecting it to other parts of the island.
