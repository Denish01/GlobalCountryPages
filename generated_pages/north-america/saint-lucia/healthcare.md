The healthcare system in Saint Lucia is structured to provide a range of services, from primary care to specialized treatments, with both public and private providers playing important roles. The public sector is responsible for providing healthcare to the majority of the population, with several hospitals and health centers located throughout the island. The private sector, on the other hand, offers more specialized and advanced care, often catering to tourists and expats. The quality of care in Saint Lucia is generally good, with many healthcare professionals trained in the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be scarce.

In urban areas, such as Castries, the capital city, healthcare services are more readily available, with several hospitals and clinics offering a range of services.
