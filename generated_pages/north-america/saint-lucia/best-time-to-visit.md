[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Lucia is a tropical island located in the Caribbean, and its climate is characterized by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is the best time to visit the island, with minimal rainfall and pleasant temperatures, averaging around 77°F (25°C) to 82°F (28°C). The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by increased rainfall and higher temperatures, with an average high of 86°F (30°C). The wet season is also the hurricane season, with the highest risk of storms occurring between September and November.

The dry season is the peak tourist season, with the highest number of visitors flocking to the island to enjoy the beautiful beaches, lush rainforests, and vibrant culture. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices for accommodations and activities. However, the wet season can still be a great time to visit Saint Lucia, as the island is lush and green, and the rainforests are in full bloom.

The seasons in Saint Lucia can affect travel plans, with the dry season being the best time for outdoor activities such as hiking, snorkeling, and diving. The wet season, while not ideal for outdoor activities, can be a great time for indoor activities such as visiting museums, shopping, and relaxing at a spa.
