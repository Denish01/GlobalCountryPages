  "content": "Boston is a city located in the northeastern United States, situated on the eastern seaboard of the continent of North America, and is the capital and largest city of the state of Massachusetts.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLand Area: 232.1 km², about the size of the island of Manhattan\nHighest Point: Bellevue Hill, 101 meters\nLowest Point: sea level\nCoastline: 48 km\nBorders: Cambridge, Somerville, Chelsea, Everett, Revere, Winthrop\nClimate Type: humid continental\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]\nBoston is situated in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is bordered by several cities and towns, including Cambridge, Somerville, Chelsea, Everett, Revere, and Winthrop. The city is surrounded by the Boston Harbor to the east, the Charles River to the north and west, and the Neponset River to the south. Boston is also close to several other major cities, including New York City, which is approximately 215 miles to the southwest, and Portland, Maine, which is approximately 107 miles to the north.\n\nThe city's strategic location on the eastern seaboard has made it an important center for trade and commerce throughout its history. Boston is also connected to the rest of the country by several major highways, including Interstate 93 and Interstate 95, and is served by Boston Logan International Airport, which is one of the busiest airports in the United States. The city's proximity to the ocean and its harbor has also made it an important center for the fishing and shipping industries.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nBoston's terrain is characterized by a mix of coastal lowlands, hills, and islands. The city is situated on a peninsula, with the Boston Harbor to the east and the Charles River to the north and west. The terrain is generally flat, with some hills and bluffs along the coastline. The highest point in the city is Bellevue Hill, which is approximately 101 meters above sea level. The city's coastline is approximately 48 kilometers long, and includes several beaches, harbors, and islands, such as Spectacle Island and Georges Island.\n\nThe city's landscape has been shaped by its history and geography. Many of the city's neighborhoods, such as the North End and Beacon Hill, are situated on hills and bluffs, and offer stunning views of the harbor and the city. The city's parks and green spaces, such as the Boston Common and the Esplanade, are also an important part of its landscape, and provide a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. The Charles River, which runs along the city's northern border, is also an important part of the city's landscape, and offers opportunities for boating, fishing, and other recreational activities.\n\nThe city's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by human activity. The city's harbor, for example, has been dredged and filled in over the years to create more land and to accommodate the city's growing population and economy. The city's coastline has also been modified by the construction of seawalls, jetties, and other coastal defenses.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 40-60°F (4-15°C) | 3-4 inches | mild, with occasional rain showers |\n| Summer | June to August | 70-85°F (21-29°C) | 3-4 inches | warm and humid, with occasional thunderstorms |\n| Autumn | September to November | 50-70°F (10-21°C) | 3-4 inches | cool and crisp, with occasional rain showers |\n| Winter | December to February | 25-40°F (-4 to 4°C) | 10-15 inches | cold and snowy, with occasional blizzards |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to October and April to May.
