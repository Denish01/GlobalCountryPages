[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Detroit is situated in the southeastern part of the state of Michigan, in the northern United States. The city is positioned on the Detroit River, which forms the border between the United States and Canada. To the south and east, Detroit is bordered by the Canadian city of Windsor, Ontario, while to the north and west, it is bordered by the states of Michigan and Ontario. The city's location has played a significant role in its development as a major industrial and commercial center, with easy access to the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

The city's proximity to the Canadian border has also made it an important center for international trade and commerce. Detroit is connected to Windsor by the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, making it a vital transportation hub for goods and people moving between the United States and Canada. The city's location on the Great Lakes has also made it a popular tourist destination, with many visitors drawn to its scenic waterfront and outdoor recreational opportunities.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Detroit's terrain is generally flat, with an average elevation of about 200 meters above sea level. The city is situated on a plain that slopes gently towards the Detroit River, which forms its southern boundary. The surrounding landscape is characterized by rolling hills and wooded areas, with many parks and nature reserves throughout the city. The Detroit River, which runs along the city's southern edge, is a significant feature of the landscape, providing scenic views and recreational opportunities for boating, fishing, and walking.

The city's landscape has been shaped by its industrial and commercial history, with many areas of the city dominated by factories, warehouses, and other industrial facilities. However, in recent years, there has been a significant effort to revitalize and redevelop many of these areas, with a focus on creating more green spaces, parks, and public amenities. The city is also home to many historic neighborhoods, each with its own unique character and charm, from the upscale shops and restaurants of the **Greektown** area to the vibrant arts scene of the **Corktown** neighborhood.

The city's terrain and landscape have also been influenced by its location on the Great Lakes, with many areas of the city experiencing significant seasonal variations in weather and climate. The city's proximity to Lake Erie and Lake Huron has also made it prone to lake-effect snow, which can bring significant snowfall to the area during the winter months.
