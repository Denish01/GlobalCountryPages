[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Los Angeles is situated in Southern California, approximately 35 miles from the Pacific Ocean, and is surrounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the east, the Santa Monica Mountains to the west, and the San Fernando Valley to the north. The city is part of Los Angeles County and is bordered by several other cities, including Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, and Pasadena, but does not share international borders with any countries. The city's coastal location and proximity to the ocean have a significant impact on its climate and geography.

The city's location in a coastal basin, surrounded by mountains, creates a unique microclimate that is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity. The Pacific Ocean plays a crucial role in shaping the city's weather patterns, with the cool ocean breeze providing relief from the heat during the summer months. The city's geography is also influenced by the Los Angeles River, which runs through the city and provides a source of water and transportation. The river, however, is largely seasonal and often dry, due to the city's **arid** climate.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Los Angeles is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, valleys, and coastal plains. The San Gabriel Mountains, which form the eastern border of the city, are a prominent feature of the landscape and offer a range of recreational activities, including hiking and skiing. The Santa Monica Mountains, which form the western border of the city, are home to a variety of flora and fauna and offer stunning views of the Pacific Ocean. The city's coastal plains, which include the Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley, are relatively flat and are home to a large proportion of the city's population.

The city's landscape is also characterized by a number of rivers and streams, including the Los Angeles River, which runs through the city and provides a source of water and transportation. The city's terrain is also influenced by its **geological** history, with the San Andreas Fault running through the region and creating a range of geological features, including fault lines and canyons. The city's diverse terrain and landscape have created a range of unique ecosystems, including coastal wetlands, mountain forests, and desert scrublands.

The city's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by human activity, with the construction of roads, buildings, and other infrastructure having a significant impact on the natural environment. The city's **urbanization** has led to the destruction of natural habitats and the loss of biodiversity, but has also created new opportunities for recreation and conservation. The city's parks and gardens, for example, provide a range of recreational activities and offer a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.
