[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
New Orleans is a vibrant city known for its rich history, jazz music, and delicious Creole cuisine. While it's a popular tourist destination, the city has a higher crime rate compared to other major cities in the United States. Visitors should be aware of their surroundings, especially at night, and take necessary precautions to protect themselves and their belongings. The city's police department has implemented various initiatives to improve safety, including increased patrols in tourist areas and a dedicated tourist police unit. However, it's still important for visitors to be mindful of their surroundings and take common-sense precautions to stay safe.

The city's safety can vary greatly depending on the area, with some neighborhoods being safer than others. The French Quarter, for example, is generally well-patrolled and safe, but it's still important to be aware of pickpocketing and scams. Other areas, such as the Central Business District and the Garden District, are also considered safe, but visitors should still be cautious, especially at night. On the other hand, some neighborhoods, such as the Lower Ninth Ward and parts of the Bywater, are considered higher-risk areas and should be avoided, especially at night.
