[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
New Orleans is situated in the southeastern part of Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico. The city is bordered by the Mississippi River to the south and east, Lake Pontchartrain to the north, and the parishes of Jefferson and St. Bernard to the west. New Orleans is approximately 105 miles east of Baton Rouge, the state capital of Louisiana, and 190 miles west of Gulfport, Mississippi. The city's unique location near the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River has played a significant role in its development as a major port city.

The city's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River has also made it vulnerable to natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding. The Mississippi River, which runs along the southern edge of the city, has been a vital transportation route for centuries and has played a significant role in the city's economic development. The surrounding parishes of Jefferson and St. Bernard are also important economic and cultural centers, with a mix of urban and rural areas. The city's location in the southern United States has also made it a cultural melting pot, with influences from European, African, and Caribbean cultures.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
New Orleans is situated in a low-lying coastal plain, with an average elevation of only 1-2 meters above sea level. The city is surrounded by a system of levees and canals, which help to protect it from flooding. The Mississippi River, which runs along the southern edge of the city, is a major geographical feature, and its delta is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including alligators, birds, and fish. The city's terrain is generally flat, with some small hills and ridges in the surrounding areas.

The city's landscape is also characterized by its many parks and green spaces, including City Park, which is one of the largest urban parks in the United States. The park is home to several lakes, walking trails, and the famous Besthoff Sculpture Garden. The city's unique geography has also made it a popular destination for outdoor activities such as kayaking, fishing, and birdwatching. The surrounding wetlands and swamps are also home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, including cypress trees, Spanish moss, and alligators.

The city's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by its history and culture. The French Quarter, with its narrow streets and historic buildings, is a popular tourist destination, and the city's many cemeteries, such as the St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, are famous for their above-ground tombs and ornate decorations. The city's unique cultural heritage is also reflected in its cuisine, music, and art, which are all influenced by its history as a major port city and cultural melting pot.
