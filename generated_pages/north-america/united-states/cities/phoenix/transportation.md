[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) is the main gateway to the city, serving over 120 domestic and international destinations. The airport is a major hub for American Airlines and offers direct flights to many cities across the United States, as well as to several international destinations in Canada, Mexico, and Europe. If you're traveling from within the United States, you can also consider flying into Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (AZA), which is located about 30 miles southeast of Phoenix and offers flights to several domestic destinations.

In addition to flying, Phoenix is also accessible by car via several major highways, including Interstate 10, which runs east-west, and Interstate 17, which runs north-south. You can also take a bus or shuttle from nearby cities, such as Los Angeles or Las Vegas, to get to Phoenix. The city is also a popular stop on several Amtrak train routes, including the Southwest Chief and the Texas Eagle, although the train station is not located in the city center and may require a taxi or ride-hailing service to get to your final destination.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
If you're traveling within the United States, you have a wide range of domestic airlines to choose from, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Southwest Airlines. These airlines offer flights to numerous destinations across the country, including major cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, as well as smaller regional airports. When booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to compare prices across several airlines to find the best deal, and to consider flying into a nearby airport if it's significantly cheaper. Approximate costs for domestic flights can vary widely depending on the route and time of year, but you can expect to pay anywhere from $100 to $500 or more for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
While Phoenix does not have an extensive rail network, the city is served by the Valley Metro Rail system, which is a 38-mile light rail line that connects several major destinations in the city, including the airport, downtown Phoenix, and several suburbs. The rail system is relatively modern and efficient, with trains running frequently throughout the day. You can also take a train to nearby cities, such as Tucson or Flagstaff, on the Amtrak train network, although the journey can take several hours and may not be as convenient as flying or driving.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Several intercity bus companies, including Greyhound and FlixBus, offer bus services to and from Phoenix, connecting the city to numerous destinations across the United States. The buses are generally comfortable and affordable, with approximate costs ranging from $20 to $100 or more for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year. The quality of the buses and the routes can vary, but many companies offer amenities like Wi-Fi and power outlets, making the journey relatively comfortable.
