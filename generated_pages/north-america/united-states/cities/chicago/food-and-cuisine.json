The city's proximity to the Great Lakes and its history as a major meatpacking hub have also shaped its food scene. Chicago-style cuisine is known for its hearty portions, rich flavors, and bold seasonings. The city's neighborhoods, such as Pilsen, Little Italy, and Greektown, offer a glimpse into the diverse culinary heritage of Chicago. From traditional diners to modern restaurants, Chicago's food culture is a fusion of old and new, with a focus on local ingredients and time-honored cooking techniques.\n\nChicago's food scene has been shaped by its history as a major immigrant hub. Many immigrants brought their culinary traditions with them, which have been adapted and transformed over time to create unique Chicago-style dishes. The city's famous deep-dish pizza, for example, is believed to have been invented by Italian immigrants in the 1940s. Similarly, the Chicago-style hot dog, with its distinctive toppings and poppy seed bun, reflects the city's German and Eastern European heritage.\n\nRegional variations also play a significant role in Chicago's cuisine. The city's South Side, for example, is known for its soul food and barbecue, while the North Side is famous for its upscale restaurants and trendy eateries. The suburbs surrounding Chicago also offer a unique culinary experience, with many restaurants serving traditional Midwestern cuisine, such as fish fries and comfort food.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Deep-Dish Pizza | Main Course | A thick-crusted pizza filled with cheese, meats, and vegetables | Lou Malnati's, Pequod's Pizza |\n| Chicago-Style Hot Dog | Street Food | A hot dog served on a poppy seed bun with mustard, relish, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers, and pickle spear | Portillo's, Alinea |\n| Italian Beef Sandwich | Sandwich | Thinly sliced roast beef served in a crusty roll with au jus | Al's Beef, Mr. Beef |\n| Chicken Vesuvio | Main Course | Chicken cooked in a spicy tomato sauce with white wine and served with potatoes and peas | Harry Caray's Italian Steakhouse, The Berghoff |\n| Polish Sausage | Street Food | A grilled sausage made with pork and beef, served with peppers and onions | Jim's Beef, Gene's Sausage Shop |\n| Jibarito Sandwich | Sandwich | A sandwich made with fried plantains instead of bread, filled with steak, cheese, and lettuce | La Bomba, 90 Miles Cuban Cafe |\n| Pierogi | Side Dish | Boiled or fried dumplings filled with meat, cheese, or vegetables | Pierogi Heaven, Smak Tak |\n| Giardiniera | Condiment | A spicy pickled vegetable mix served as a condiment | The Berghoff, Gene's Sausage Shop |\n| Churros | Dessert | Fried dough pastry coated in cinnamon sugar, served with chocolate sauce | Xoco, Churro Factory |\n| Eli's Cheesecake | Dessert | A classic cheesecake with a graham cracker crust and creamy filling | Eli's Cheesecake, The Cheesecake Factory |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Chicago-Style Popcorn**: a mix of caramel and cheese-coated popcorn, $5-$7 per bag\n- **Hot Dogs**: served at street carts and restaurants throughout the city, $3-$5 per hot dog\n- **Italian Ice**: a sweet and tangy frozen treat, $3-$5 per cup\n- **Churros**: fried dough pastry coated in cinnamon sugar, $5-$7 per serving\n- **Pretzels**: soft and salty pretzels, often served with cheese or mustard, $5-$7 per pretzel\n- **Elephant Ear**: a large, crispy flour tortilla topped with cinnamon sugar, $5-$7 per ear\n- **Cotton Candy**: a sweet and fluffy treat, $5-$7 per serving\n- **Funnel Cakes**: deep-fried dough topped with powdered sugar, $7-$10 per cake\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Old Style Beer**: a classic Chicago beer, $5-$7 per pint\n- **Malört**: a bitter and sweet liqueur made from wormwood, $10-$15 per shot\n- **Chicago-Style Coffee**: a strong and rich coffee, $2-$5 per cup\n- **Lake Shore Lager**: a crisp and refreshing beer, $5-$7 per pint\n- **Fresh-Squeezed Lemonade**: a sweet and tangy drink, $5-$7 per cup\n- **Iced Tea**: a refreshing and thirst-quenching drink, $2-$5 per cup\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Tipping**: 15-20% of the total bill is expected at restaurants and bars\n- **Reservations**: recommended for popular restaurants, especially on weekends\n- **Dress Code**: casual to formal, depending on the restaurant and occasion\n- **Eating Etiquette**: keep your hands visible, don't talk with your mouth full, and don't double dip\n- **Food Sharing**: common at casual restaurants and street food vendors\n- **Payment**: cash, credit, and debit cards are widely accepted\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Restaurants**: from casual diners to upscale eateries, offering a wide range of cuisines\n- **Food Courts**: located in shopping malls and markets, offering a variety of international cuisines\n- **Street Food Vendors**: offering classic Chicago-style hot dogs, Italian beef, and other snacks\n- **Markets**: such as the Chicago French Market and the Maxwell Street Market, offering fresh produce, meats, and prepared foods\n- **Cafes**: cozy spots for coffee, pastries, and light meals\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Chicago French Market**: a indoor market offering a variety of cuisines, including French, Italian, and Mexican, located at 131 N Clinton St\n- **Maxwell Street Market**: a outdoor market offering fresh produce, meats, and prepared foods, located at 800 S Desplaines St\n- **Pilsen Food Tour**: a guided tour of the Pilsen neighborhood, featuring Mexican cuisine and culture, starting at 18th St and Halsted St\n- **Chicago Food Truck Festival**: a annual festival featuring a variety of food trucks and live music, located at 2400 S Dearborn St\n- **The Taste of Chicago**: a annual festival featuring a variety of cuisines and live music, located at 301 S Columbus Dr",
