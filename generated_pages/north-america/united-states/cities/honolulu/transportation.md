You can also fly into Honolulu from other Hawaiian islands, such as Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island, on inter-island flights. If you're traveling from the mainland United States, you can fly into Honolulu from major cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.

Alternatively, you can take a ferry from other Hawaiian islands, such as Maui and Kauai, to Oahu, although this option is less frequent and may not be as convenient.
