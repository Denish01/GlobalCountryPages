[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Houston is situated in the southeastern part of Texas, approximately 50 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. The city is bordered by several counties, including Fort Bend County to the southwest, Waller County to the northwest, Montgomery County to the north, Chambers County to the east, Galveston County to the southeast, and Brazoria County to the south. Houston is also located near several major waterways, including the Houston Ship Channel, which connects the city to the Gulf of Mexico, and Galveston Bay, a large estuary that provides a habitat for a diverse range of marine life.

The city's location near the Gulf of Mexico has played a significant role in its development as a major port city and commercial center. The Houston Ship Channel, which runs through the city, is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, and the city's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico has made it an important center for the oil and gas industry. Additionally, Houston's location in the southeastern United States has made it a major hub for international trade and commerce, with the city's two major airports, George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport, providing connections to destinations around the world.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain in Houston is generally flat, with an average elevation of around 50 feet above sea level. The city is located in the Gulf Coastal Plain, a region of low-lying coastal plains and prairies that stretches along the Gulf of Mexico. The landscape is dominated by **wetlands**, **prairies**, and **forests**, with several major waterways, including the Buffalo Bayou, the White Oak Bayou, and the Houston Ship Channel, running through the city. The city's flat terrain and low elevation make it prone to **flooding**, particularly during heavy rainfall events or storms.

The city's landscape has been shaped by its location near the Gulf of Mexico and its history of human settlement. The **Katy Prairie**, a large prairie ecosystem that once covered much of the region, has been largely urbanized, but remnants of the prairie still exist in the city's outskirts. The **Big Thicket**, a dense forest ecosystem that covers parts of southeastern Texas, is also located near Houston, and provides a habitat for a diverse range of plant and animal species. Additionally, the city's **wetlands**, including the **Armand Bayou** and the **Taylor Bayou**, provide important habitats for wildlife and help to filter pollutants from the city's waterways.

The city's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by human activities, such as the construction of the Houston Ship Channel and the development of the city's **petrochemical industry**. The channel, which runs through the city, has been dredged and widened over the years to accommodate large ships and tankers, and has played a significant role in the city's economic development. However, the channel has also had environmental impacts, including the destruction of **wetlands** and the degradation of water quality.
