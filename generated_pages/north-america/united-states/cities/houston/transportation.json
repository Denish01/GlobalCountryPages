Hobby Airport (HOU). George Bush Intercontinental Airport is one of the busiest airports in the United States, with direct flights to over 170 destinations around the world. William P. Hobby Airport, on the other hand, is a smaller airport that primarily serves domestic and international flights to Latin America and the Caribbean. If you're traveling to Houston by land, you can enter the city via several major highways, including Interstate 10, Interstate 45, and US Highway 290.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Houston from within the United States, you can also take a bus or train to the city. Several bus companies, including Greyhound and Megabus, operate daily routes to Houston from major cities across the country. Alternatively, you can take the train, with Amtrak's Sunset Limited and Texas Eagle routes passing through Houston. However, it's worth noting that the train network in the United States is limited, and journeys can be long and infrequent.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nHouston has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights to and from the city's two airports. United Airlines is the largest carrier at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, with flights to over 150 destinations across the United States. Other major airlines, such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Southwest Airlines, also operate flights to and from Houston. When booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to compare prices across different airlines and book in advance to get the best deals.

The METRORail is a 22-mile light rail system that connects several major destinations in Houston, including downtown, the Texas Medical Center, and Reliant Park. However, there are no high-speed rail options in Houston, and the city is not connected to the rest of the country by a comprehensive rail network. If you're planning to take the train, you can book tickets through Amtrak's website or at a station in person. It's worth noting that train travel in the United States can be slow and infrequent, and is often more expensive than flying or driving.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nSeveral intercity bus companies operate in Houston, including Greyhound, Megabus, and FlixBus. These companies offer affordable fares and frequent departures to destinations across the United States. The quality of bus travel in Houston varies depending on the company and route, but most buses are modern and comfortable, with amenities such as Wi-Fi and power outlets.
