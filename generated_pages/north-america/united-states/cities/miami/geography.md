Miami is also surrounded by several smaller cities and towns, including Miami Beach, Coral Gables, and Fort Lauderdale. The city's location on the southeastern coast of Florida makes it a major hub for international trade and tourism.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Miami's terrain is generally flat, with an average elevation of only 1.5 meters above sea level. The city is situated on a **coastal plain**, which is a flat or gently sloping area of land that is adjacent to the ocean. The coastal plain is bounded by the **Atlantic Coastal Ridge**, a narrow strip of high ground that runs along the eastern edge of the Everglades. The city's terrain is also characterized by a number of **wetlands**, including the Everglades, which is a vast and unique ecosystem that is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species.

The city is also home to a number of **beaches**, including **South Beach**, which is known for its white sand and clear water. Miami's terrain and landscape are also influenced by its **geology**, which is characterized by a layer of **limestone** and **dolostone** that underlies the city. This geology has created a number of unique features, including **sinkholes** and **caverns**.

The city's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by **human activity**, including the construction of **canals**, **dams**, and **seawalls**.
