[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
San Antonio is situated in the south-central part of Texas, approximately 200 miles west of Houston and 275 miles south of Dallas. The city is nestled in the Texas Hill Country, a region characterized by rolling hills, scenic valleys, and vast ranchlands. San Antonio is not a country or territory, but rather a city within the United States, and as such, it does not have international borders. However, it is surrounded by several counties, including Bexar County, which is the county seat. The city's proximity to the Mexican border, about 150 miles south, has contributed to its rich cultural heritage and unique blend of American and Mexican influences.

The city's location in the southern United States has also made it an important hub for trade and commerce, with several major highways and interstates passing through the city. The San Antonio International Airport, located about 8 miles north of downtown, provides easy access to the city and connecting flights to destinations across the United States and around the world. The city's central location has also made it an attractive destination for tourists, with many nearby attractions, including the Alamo, a former Spanish mission and one of the most famous landmarks in Texas.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
San Antonio's terrain is characterized by rolling hills, scenic valleys, and vast ranchlands, with the city itself situated in a valley surrounded by hills. The landscape is dotted with numerous creeks, rivers, and lakes, including the San Antonio River, which runs through the heart of the city and has played a crucial role in the city's development. The river is lined with beautiful parks, gardens, and walkways, making it a popular destination for outdoor recreation and relaxation. The city's terrain is also home to several natural springs, including the famous San Antonio Springs, which have been used for centuries for irrigation, drinking water, and other purposes.

The surrounding hill country is home to several state and national parks, including the Guadalupe River State Park and the Hill Country State Natural Area, which offer opportunities for hiking, camping, fishing, and other outdoor activities. The city's landscape has also been shaped by human activity, with numerous farms, ranches, and urban developments scattered throughout the area. The city's terrain has been modified over the years to accommodate growth and development, with many areas being leveled or graded to make way for new construction.

The city's unique landscape has also been influenced by its geology, with the area being located near the Balcones Fault Zone, a region of significant geological activity. The fault zone has created a unique landscape of hills, valleys, and canyons, with numerous caves, springs, and other geological features. The area is also home to several unique rock formations, including the famous Texas limestone, which has been used for centuries in construction and other applications.
