[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Orlando is a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year to its theme parks, such as Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando. The city has a strong police presence, and most tourist areas are well-patrolled and considered safe. However, as with any major city, there are areas that are considered safer than others, and visitors should take normal precautions to protect themselves and their belongings. Petty crimes, such as pickpocketing and theft, can occur in crowded areas and tourist hotspots, while violent crimes are relatively rare.

Orlando's safety can also be affected by its location in a hurricane-prone area, and visitors should be aware of the weather forecast during their trip. Additionally, the city's many theme parks and attractions can be crowded and overwhelming, especially during peak season, which can increase the risk of accidents and illnesses. Overall, Orlando is a safe city to visit, but visitors should still take necessary precautions to ensure their safety, such as being aware of their surroundings, keeping valuables secure, and following local advice and instructions.
