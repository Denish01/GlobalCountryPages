Orlando International Airport is the primary airport, serving over 40 million passengers annually, and offers direct flights to numerous domestic and international destinations. You can fly directly to Orlando from major hubs like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami, as well as from international cities like London, Toronto, and Rio de Janeiro. Overland entry points are also available, with several major highways, including Interstate 4 and the Florida Turnpike, connecting Orlando to other cities in the United States.

If you prefer to travel by land, you can take a bus or drive to Orlando from nearby cities like Miami, Tampa, or Jacksonville. Several bus companies, including Greyhound and Megabus, operate daily services to Orlando, with fares starting from around $20.
