[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The United States has a well-developed education system, with both public and private schools offering high-quality education. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, and the quality of education can vary depending on the school district and location. Private schools, on the other hand, can offer a more exclusive and specialized education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.

The quality of education in the United States is generally high, with many schools and universities ranking among the best in the world. However, there are also significant disparities in education quality, particularly between urban and rural areas, and between public and private schools. Additionally, the cost of education can be a significant barrier for many families, particularly for those seeking to attend private schools or universities.
