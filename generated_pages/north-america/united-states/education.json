Primary education, also known as elementary education, typically lasts from kindergarten to 5th grade, while secondary education, also known as high school, lasts from 6th to 12th grade. Tertiary education, also known as college or university, offers a wide range of academic programs, including associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. The quality of education in the United States is generally considered to be high, with many public and private institutions ranking among the best in the world. However, there are significant differences in the quality of education between public and private schools, as well as between different regions and socioeconomic groups.\n\nThe public education system in the United States is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 18, although some states allow children to start school at age 4 or 6. Public schools are funded by local, state, and federal governments, and are generally considered to be of high quality, although there are significant disparities in funding and resources between different schools and districts. Private schools, on the other hand, are funded by tuition and private donations, and are often considered to be of higher quality than public schools, although they can be very expensive.\n\nIn addition to public and private schools, the United States is also home to a wide range of **alternative education** programs, including charter schools, magnet schools, and online schools. These programs offer students a more personalized and flexible education, and are often designed to meet the needs of students who may not thrive in traditional school environments.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
