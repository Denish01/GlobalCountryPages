Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of United States before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nThe United States has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of 40 countries, including many European nations, Australia, and Japan, are eligible for visa-free access under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), which allows them to stay in the US for up to 90 days without a visa. However, they must still obtain an electronic travel authorization (ESTA) prior to their trip. On the other hand, citizens of countries not participating in the VWP may need to apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate.\n\nThe US visa policy is designed to balance national security, economic, and social interests, while also facilitating international travel and tourism. The country's visa requirements and regulations are subject to change, so it's essential to check with the official authorities for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | N/A | N/A | US citizens do not need a visa to enter the US |\n| UK Citizens | No | ESTA | 90 days | Under the Visa Waiver Program |\n| EU Citizens | No | ESTA | 90 days | Under the Visa Waiver Program, except for some newer EU member states |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | N/A | N/A | Canadians do not need a visa, but may need an ESTA or eTA for certain types of travel |\n| Australian Citizens | No | ESTA | 90 days | Under the Visa Waiver Program |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Non-immigrant visa | varies | Requires a visa application at a US embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Non-immigrant visa | varies | Requires a visa application at a US embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** To enter the US as a tourist, you'll typically need a valid passport, a return or onward ticket, and proof of sufficient funds.
