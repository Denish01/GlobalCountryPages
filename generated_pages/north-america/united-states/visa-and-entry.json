[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nThe United States has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of 39 countries, including many European nations, Australia, and Japan, are eligible for the **Visa Waiver Program (VWP)**, which allows them to stay in the US for up to 90 days without a visa. However, they must obtain an **Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA)** approval prior to their flight to the US. Other nationalities may need to apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate.\n\nThe US visa policy is designed to balance national security, economic, and social interests. The country has a long history of immigration, and its visa policy reflects this complex and sometimes contentious issue. The US government has implemented various programs and initiatives to facilitate travel and immigration, while also ensuring the safety and security of its citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | N/A | N/A | US citizens do not need a visa to enter the US |\n| UK Citizens | No | VWP/ESTA | 90 days | UK citizens are eligible for the VWP and must obtain an ESTA approval |\n| EU Citizens | No | VWP/ESTA | 90 days | Most EU citizens are eligible for the VWP and must obtain an ESTA approval |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | N/A | N/A | Canadian citizens do not need a visa to enter the US, but may need to show proof of citizenship and identity |\n| Australian Citizens | No | VWP/ESTA | 90 days | Australian citizens are eligible for the VWP and must obtain an ESTA approval |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Non-Immigrant Visa | varies | Indian citizens must apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Non-Immigrant Visa | varies | Chinese citizens must apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists from eligible countries can enter the US under the VWP or with a non-immigrant visa.
