[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The United States is a linguistically diverse country, with **English** being the most widely spoken language. However, there are many regional dialects and minority languages spoken across the country. For example, **Spanish** is widely spoken in areas such as the Southwest, California, and Florida, while **Chinese** is commonly spoken in cities like New York and San Francisco. Additionally, many indigenous languages are still spoken by Native American communities, such as **Navajo** and **Cherokee**. Despite this linguistic diversity, **English** is the primary language used in government, education, and business, and is widely understood by the vast majority of the population.

The linguistic landscape of the United States is also influenced by the country's history of immigration, with many languages being spoken by immigrant communities. For example, **Italian**, **German**, and **Polish** are still spoken by many Americans of European descent, while **Korean**, **Vietnamese**, and **Tagalog** are spoken by many Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent. However, **English** remains the dominant language, and is widely used as a lingua franca to facilitate communication between people of different linguistic backgrounds.

Overall, the United States is a country with a rich linguistic diversity, but **English** is the primary language that is widely understood and used across the country. Whether you are visiting a major city or a small town, you can generally expect to be able to communicate in **English**, although it's always helpful to learn a few basic phrases in other languages to show respect for the local culture.
