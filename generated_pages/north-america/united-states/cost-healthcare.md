[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The United States has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private providers. The quality of care is generally high, but the cost can be significant, especially for those without insurance. Locals typically have access to a range of healthcare options, including employer-sponsored insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid, while foreigners may need to purchase private insurance or pay out-of-pocket for care. The system can be complex, and navigating it can be challenging, especially for those who are not familiar with the healthcare landscape. In general, public healthcare facilities, such as community clinics, may offer lower-cost options, while private hospitals and specialist care can be more expensive.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has expanded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, but the system remains imperfect, and many people still struggle to access affordable care. For foreigners, it is highly recommended to have some form of insurance coverage, as medical bills can be substantial. Many private insurance companies offer plans specifically designed for expats and international visitors, which can provide access to a network of healthcare providers and help to mitigate the cost of care. It is essential to research and understands the different options available, including the costs, benefits, and limitations of each plan.
