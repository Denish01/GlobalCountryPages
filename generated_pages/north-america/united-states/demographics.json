The country's population has been steadily growing over the years, with a growth rate of 0.7% per annum. This growth rate is driven by a combination of natural increase (the difference between births and deaths) and net migration (the difference between the number of people moving into the country and those moving out). The population of the United States is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 87% of the population residing in urban areas. This trend is expected to continue, with many people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe population of the United States is also characterized by significant migration patterns. The country has a long history of immigration, with people from all over the world moving to the United States in search of a better life. This has resulted in a diverse population, with people from different ethnic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds. The majority of immigrants come from Latin America, Asia, and Europe, with many settling in urban areas such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami.\n\nThe population of the United States is also aging, with the median age increasing over the years. This has significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social security programs. The aging population is also expected to drive changes in the labor market, with many older workers retiring and younger workers entering the workforce.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Non-Hispanic White | 60.1% | Throughout the country | Largest ethnic group |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 18.3% | Southwest, Florida, and urban areas | Diverse group with roots in Latin America |\n| African American | 12.6% | Southern states and urban areas | Significant cultural and historical presence |\n| Asian | 6.9% | West Coast and urban areas | Rapidly growing population with diverse roots in Asia |\n| American Indian or Alaska Native | 1.3% | Native American reservations and rural areas | Indigenous peoples with distinct cultures and traditions |\n| Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander | 0.6% | Hawaii and West Coast | Small but distinct ethnic group |\nThe United States is a melting pot of different ethnic groups, with no single group dominating the population.
