# United States Visa & Entry Requirements

To determine if you need a visa for the United States, it is essential to check the specific requirements based on your nationality and the purpose of your visit.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The United States has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of 39 countries, including many European nations, Australia, and Japan, are eligible for the **Visa Waiver Program (VWP)**, which allows them to stay in the US for up to 90 days without a visa. However, they must obtain an **Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA)** approval prior to their flight to the US. Other nationalities may need to apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate.

The US visa policy is designed to balance national security, economic, and social interests. The country has a long history of immigration, and its visa policy reflects this complex and sometimes contentious issue. The US government has implemented various programs and initiatives to facilitate travel and immigration, while also ensuring the safety and security of its citizens.
