# United States Visa & Entry Requirements

To enter the United States, you may or may not need a visa, depending on your nationality, purpose of visit, and length of stay. 

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of United States before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The United States has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of 40 countries, including many European nations, Australia, and Japan, are eligible for visa-free access under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), which allows them to stay in the US for up to 90 days without a visa. However, they must still obtain an electronic travel authorization (ESTA) prior to their trip. On the other hand, citizens of countries not participating in the VWP may need to apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate.

The US visa policy is designed to balance national security, economic, and social interests, while also facilitating international travel and tourism. The country's visa requirements and regulations are subject to change, so it's essential to check with the official authorities for the latest information.

The usual length of stay for tourists is up to 90 days, but this can be extended in certain circumstances. **Business Travelers:** If you're traveling to the US for business, you may need to provide additional documentation, such as a letter of invitation from a US company or organization, and proof of your business activities. **Students:** International students coming to the US to study need to apply for an F-1 visa, which requires proof of enrollment at a US educational institution and sufficient financial resources. **Workers:** If you're planning to work in the US, you'll need to obtain a work visa, such as an H-1B or L-1 visa, which requires sponsorship from a US employer.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The US has numerous entry points, including major airports such as John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and Miami International Airport (MIA). When arriving at a US airport, you'll need to go through immigration and customs procedures, which typically involve presenting your travel documents, completing a customs declaration form, and undergoing a brief interview with a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer. If you're entering the US by land or sea, you'll need to stop at a designated port of entry and follow similar procedures.

The US also has a preclearance program, which allows certain international travelers to clear US customs and immigration before boarding their flight to the US. This program is available at select airports in Canada, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates.
