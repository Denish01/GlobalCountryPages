The state has a high quality of care, with many top-ranked hospitals and medical institutions, particularly in urban areas such as Columbus and Cleveland. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where there may be fewer providers and longer travel times to reach medical facilities. Despite these challenges, Ohio has made significant strides in improving healthcare outcomes and increasing access to care, particularly for low-income and vulnerable populations. The state has expanded its Medicaid program, increased funding for community health centers, and implemented initiatives to address health disparities and improve health equity.\n\nThe quality of care in Ohio is generally high, with many hospitals and medical centers earning top ratings from organizations such as the Joint Commission and the Leapfrog Group. However, there are also significant disparities in health outcomes and access to care, particularly for certain racial and ethnic groups, as well as for individuals with lower incomes and education levels. To address these disparities, the state has implemented a range of initiatives, including programs to increase access to health insurance, improve health literacy, and provide culturally competent care.\n\nOhio's healthcare system is also characterized by a strong presence of private insurance providers, with many individuals and families obtaining coverage through their employers or purchasing individual plans through the health insurance marketplace. The state has also expanded its Medicaid program, which provides coverage to low-income individuals and families, as well as to certain populations such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with disabilities.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ohio State University
