It is bordered by several states, including Pennsylvania to the east, West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the south, Indiana to the west, and Michigan to the northwest. Ohio is also bordered by Lake Erie to the north, which is one of the Great Lakes. The state's location in the Midwestern region makes it a hub for transportation and commerce, with several major highways and railroads passing through it.\n\nOhio's borders are also home to several major rivers, including the Ohio River, which forms the southern border of the state. The state's location in the Midwestern region also makes it prone to extreme weather conditions, including tornadoes and blizzards. Despite these challenges, Ohio's location has made it an attractive place to live and do business, with several major cities, including Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati, located within its borders.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nOhio's terrain is characterized by a mix of flat plains, rolling hills, and rugged landscapes. The state's landscape is divided into several distinct regions, including the Appalachian Plateau, the Allegheny Plateau, and the Erie Plain. The Appalachian Plateau is located in the southeastern part of the state and is characterized by rugged hills and valleys. The Allegheny Plateau is located in the eastern part of the state and is characterized by a mix of hills and valleys. The Erie Plain is located in the northern part of the state and is characterized by flat plains and Lake Erie shoreline.\n\nOhio is also home to several major rivers, including the Ohio River, the Cuyahoga River, and the Scioto River. These rivers have played a significant role in shaping the state's landscape and have provided transportation and commerce opportunities for centuries. The state's landscape is also home to several major forests, including the Wayne National Forest and the Shawnee State Forest. These forests provide habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including deer, turkey, and black bears.\n\nThe state's terrain has also been shaped by glaciers, which covered much of the state during the last ice age. The glaciers left behind a mix of flat plains, rolling hills, and rugged landscapes, which have been eroded over time by rivers and streams. Today, Ohio's landscape is a mix of urban, suburban, and rural areas, with several major cities and towns located throughout the state.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 10-20°C | 80-100 mm | Mild, with occasional rain showers |\n| Summer | June to August | 20-30°C | 90-120 mm | Hot and humid, with occasional thunderstorms |\n| Autumn | September to November | 10-20°C | 60-90 mm | Cool, with occasional rain showers |\n| Winter | December to February | -10 to 0°C | 30-60 mm | Cold, with occasional snowstorms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to October and April to May.
