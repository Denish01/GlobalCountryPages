[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Georgia is a mixed model, with both public and private providers playing a significant role. The public system is primarily funded through the state's Medicaid program and the federal government, while private providers offer a range of services, from primary care to specialized treatments. The quality of care in Georgia is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics meeting high standards. However, there are still disparities in access to care, particularly in rural areas, where healthcare facilities and specialists may be scarce. Urban areas, such as Atlanta, tend to have better access to healthcare services, with many top-ranked hospitals and medical centers.

The state has made efforts to improve access to care, particularly for low-income residents, through the expansion of Medicaid and the creation of community health centers. However, the healthcare system in Georgia still faces challenges, including a shortage of primary care physicians in rural areas and a high rate of uninsured residents. Despite these challenges, Georgia has made progress in improving healthcare outcomes, with a focus on preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health services.

Georgia's healthcare system is also influenced by its **health insurance** landscape, which includes a range of options, from private insurers to public programs like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. The state has a relatively high rate of uninsured residents, which can make it difficult for some individuals to access care. However, there are also many resources available to help residents navigate the healthcare system and find affordable coverage.
