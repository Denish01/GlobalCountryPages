[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Georgia's climate varies from humid subtropical to oceanic, with four distinct seasons. The state has a diverse geography, with mountains, forests, and coastal regions, each with its own unique climate characteristics. The dry season, which typically runs from September to April, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it an ideal time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to August, is marked by hot and humid weather, with frequent thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. The seasons can significantly affect travel, with popular destinations like the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Golden Isles experiencing peak tourist seasons during the summer and holiday weekends.

The climate zones in Georgia also play a significant role in determining the best time to visit. The northern part of the state, which includes the Blue Ridge Mountains, has a cooler climate, with cold winters and mild summers. The central and southern regions, which include the Piedmont and the Coastal Plain, have a more temperate climate, with hot summers and mild winters. Understanding these climate zones can help visitors plan their trip and make the most of their time in Georgia.

In addition to the climate zones, the time of year can also impact the types of activities and events that are available. For example, the spring and fall seasons are ideal for outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and kayaking, while the summer months are better suited for beach trips and water sports. The winter months, on the other hand, are perfect for visiting museums, historic sites, and indoor attractions.
