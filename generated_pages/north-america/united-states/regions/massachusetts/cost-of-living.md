[SECTION] How Expensive Is Massachusetts? [/SECTION]
Massachusetts, particularly the Boston area, is considered one of the more expensive states to live in within the United States. Compared to global averages, Massachusetts falls on the higher end of the cost spectrum, similar to other major metropolitan areas in North America and Europe. The cost of living in Massachusetts is influenced by its high demand for housing, education, and healthcare, as well as its proximity to major cities like New York and Washington D.C. When compared to its neighbors, such as New Hampshire and Vermont, Massachusetts tends to have higher costs, especially in terms of housing and transportation.

The state's economy, driven by industries like technology, biotechnology, and finance, contributes to its high cost of living. However, the quality of life, education system, and cultural attractions make Massachusetts an attractive place to live and visit, despite the expenses. Visitors and residents alike can expect to pay premium prices for accommodations, food, and transportation, especially in popular areas like Boston and Cape Cod.
