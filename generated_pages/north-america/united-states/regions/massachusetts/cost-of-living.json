[/SECTION]\nMassachusetts, particularly the Boston area, is considered one of the more expensive states to live in within the United States. Compared to global averages, Massachusetts falls on the higher end of the cost spectrum, similar to other major metropolitan areas in North America and Europe. The cost of living in Massachusetts is influenced by its high demand for housing, education, and healthcare, as well as its proximity to major cities like New York and Washington D.C. When compared to its neighbors, such as New Hampshire and Vermont, Massachusetts tends to have higher costs, especially in terms of housing and transportation.\n\nThe state's economy, driven by industries like technology, biotechnology, and finance, contributes to its high cost of living.
