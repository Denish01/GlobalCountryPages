[SECTION] How Expensive Is Hawaii? [/SECTION]
Hawaii is one of the most expensive places to live in the United States, with a cost of living index that is significantly higher than the national average. The main factors contributing to the high cost of living in Hawaii are the state's remote location, limited land availability, and high demand for housing and services. Compared to other popular tourist destinations in the United States, Hawaii is more expensive than cities like New York or Los Angeles, but on par with other island destinations like Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands. Overall, visitors to Hawaii should be prepared for high prices, especially when it comes to accommodation, food, and transportation.

The high cost of living in Hawaii is also driven by the state's unique geography and economy. Hawaii is the most geographically isolated population center in the world, which makes it difficult and expensive to transport goods and services to the islands. Additionally, the state's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which drives up demand for housing, food, and other services, and contributes to higher prices. Despite the high cost of living, many people find that the unique culture, stunning natural beauty, and high standard of living in Hawaii make it an attractive place to visit or live.
