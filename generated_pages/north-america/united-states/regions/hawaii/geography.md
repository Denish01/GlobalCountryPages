[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Hawaii is situated in the central Pacific Ocean, and its geographic location makes it one of the most remote population centers in the world. The state is comprised of eight main islands, including Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Hawaii Island, Lanai, Molokai, Niihau, and Kahoolawe. Hawaii is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean to the north, south, east, and west, with no neighboring countries or territories sharing a land border.

The islands of Hawaii are located near the **Equator**, and are influenced by the trade winds and the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean. The state's unique location has created a diverse range of ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to arid deserts, and from coral reefs to snow-capped mountains. The closest countries to Hawaii are Japan, the Philippines, and Kiribati, but these countries are still over 2,000 miles away.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Hawaii is a volcanic archipelago, with five active volcanoes, including **Kilauea**, which has been erupting continuously since 1983. The islands are mountainous, with **Mauna Kea** being the tallest peak, rising over 4,200 meters above sea level. The landscape of Hawaii is characterized by rugged coastlines, scenic valleys, and fertile plains, with many areas still covered in tropical rainforests. The islands are also home to numerous **waterfalls**, including the famous **Akaka Falls** and **Umauma Falls**.

The terrain of Hawaii is varied, with different islands having distinct landscapes. For example, the island of **Kauai** is known for its lush green mountains and scenic valleys, while the island of **Maui** is famous for its volcanic landscapes and scenic **Road to Hana**. The island of **Hawaii**, also known as the **Big Island**, is the largest island in the state and is home to a diverse range of landscapes, including tropical rainforests, arid deserts, and snow-capped mountains.
