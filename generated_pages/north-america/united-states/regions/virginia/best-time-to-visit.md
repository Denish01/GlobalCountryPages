Virginia has a humid subtropical climate, with four distinct seasons.

The climate varies across these regions, with the mountains experiencing colder winters and cooler summers, while the coastal areas are generally milder. The spring and fall seasons are characterized by mild temperatures, with average highs in the 60s and 70s (15-26°C), making them ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and visiting historic sites.

The summer months are warm and humid, with average highs often reaching the 90s (32-37°C), while the winters are cold, with average lows ranging from 20-40°F (-7 to 4°C). The wettest months are typically May and September, with an average of 4-5 inches (10-13 cm) of precipitation. The dryest months are usually January and February, with an average of 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) of precipitation. Understanding these seasonal patterns can help travelers plan their trip and make the most of their time in Virginia.

The seasons also affect travel in Virginia, with peak tourist season occurring during the summer months when schools are on break and families take vacations. The spring and fall seasons are also popular, but less crowded than the summer, making them ideal for those looking for a more relaxed pace.
