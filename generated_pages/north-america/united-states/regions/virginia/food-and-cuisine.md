[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Virginia's cuisine is defined by its rich history, geography, and cultural influences. The state's location on the Atlantic coast and its proximity to the Chesapeake Bay have made seafood a staple in many Virginia dishes. The colonial era also left a lasting impact on the state's cuisine, with many traditional dishes still featuring ingredients like tobacco and corn. Regional variations are also prominent, with the Shenandoah Valley known for its German-influenced cuisine and the Eastern Shore famous for its seafood.

The state's cuisine has also been shaped by its African American and Native American heritage, with many traditional dishes featuring ingredients like okra, collard greens, and wild game. Virginia is also famous for its **barbecue**, with different regions featuring their own unique styles and sauces. From the tangy, vinegar-based sauces of the Eastern Shore to the sweet, tomato-based sauces of the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia's barbecue is a must-try for any visitor.

In addition to its traditional cuisine, Virginia is also home to a thriving food scene, with many modern restaurants and chefs putting their own spin on classic dishes. The state is also known for its **farm-to-table** movement, with many restaurants and markets featuring locally sourced ingredients and products. This emphasis on local and sustainable food has helped to promote Virginia's agricultural industry and support local farmers and producers.
