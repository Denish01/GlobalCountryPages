The state's geography is diverse, with the Blue Ridge Mountains to the west, the Piedmont region in the center, and the Coastal Plain to the east. The climate varies across these regions, with the mountains experiencing colder winters and cooler summers, while the coastal areas are generally milder. The spring and fall seasons are characterized by mild temperatures, with average highs in the 60s and 70s (15-26°C), making them ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and visiting historic sites.\n\nThe summer months are warm and humid, with average highs often reaching the 90s (32-37°C), while the winters are cold, with average lows ranging from 20-40°F (-7 to 4°C). The wettest months are typically May and September, with an average of 4-5 inches (10-13 cm) of precipitation. The dryest months are usually January and February, with an average of 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) of precipitation. Understanding these seasonal patterns can help travelers plan their trip and make the most of their time in Virginia.\n\nThe seasons also affect travel in Virginia, with peak tourist season occurring during the summer months when schools are on break and families take vacations. The spring and fall seasons are also popular, but less crowded than the summer, making them ideal for those looking for a more relaxed pace. The winter months are generally the quietest, with fewer tourists, but many attractions and historic sites may be closed or operate on reduced schedules.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cold, snowy | Low | $ | Winter sports, museum visits |\n| February | Cold, icy | Low | $ | Valentine's Day events, wine tastings |\n| March | Mild, rainy | Med | $$ | Spring festivals, hiking |\n| April | Mild, blooming | Med | $$ | Gardening events, outdoor activities |\n| May | Warm, sunny | Med | $$ | Outdoor festivals, historic site visits |\n| June | Warm, humid | High | $$$ | Summer concerts, beach trips |\n| July | Hot, humid | High | $$$ | Independence Day celebrations, water sports |\n| August | Hot, humid | High | $$$ | Outdoor events, family vacations |\n| September | Mild, sunny | Med | $$ | Wine festivals, apple picking |\n| October | Cool, crisp | Med | $$ | Fall foliage, Halloween events |\n| November | Cool, rainy | Med | $$ | Thanksgiving events, holiday shopping |\n| December | Cold, snowy | Low | $ | Holiday lights, winter sports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Virginia Festival of the Arts | May-June | A celebration of music, theater, and dance performances |\n| Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival | April-May | A festival featuring apple blossom viewing, parades, and live music |\n| Virginia Beach Neptune Festival | September | A boardwalk festival with live music, food, and sand sculpting competitions |\n| Richmond Jazz Festival | August | A jazz festival featuring local and national performers |\n| Williamsburg Christmas Decorations | December | A historic holiday celebration with decorations, lights, and festivities |\n| Virginia Wine Festival | September-October | A festival featuring wine tastings, live music, and food pairings |\n| Hampton Bay Days Festival | September | A waterfront festival with live music, food, and boat tours |\n| Charlottesville Tomato Festival | August | A festival celebrating local tomatoes, with food, drink, and live music |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The Blue Ridge Mountains have a cooler climate than the rest of the state, with colder winters and cooler summers, making them ideal for winter sports and summer hiking.\n- The Coastal Plain region has a milder climate, with warmer winters and hotter summers, making it ideal for beach trips and water sports.\n- The Piedmont region has a moderate climate, with mild winters and hot summers, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as biking and horseback riding.\n- The Shenandoah Valley has a rural climate, with colder winters and cooler summers, making it ideal for winter sports and spring festivals.\n- The Eastern Shore has a coastal climate, with mild winters and hot summers, making it ideal for beach trips and water sports.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book accommodations and popular attractions well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October) for smaller crowds and lower prices.\n- Pack layers for your trip, as the weather can be unpredictable, especially in the spring and fall.\n- Check the weather forecast before your trip and plan accordingly, as some attractions and events may be weather-dependent.\n- Be aware of holidays and special events, such as Independence Day and Thanksgiving, which can attract large crowds and higher prices.\n- Take advantage of free or low-cost activities, such as visiting historic sites, hiking, or attending outdoor festivals, to save money and experience the local culture.",
