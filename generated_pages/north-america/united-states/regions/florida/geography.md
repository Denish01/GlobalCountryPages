[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Florida is situated in the southeastern United States, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. The region shares borders with two states: Georgia to the north and Alabama to the west. Florida is also surrounded by several bodies of water, including the Straits of Florida, which separate the state from Cuba, and the Apalachicola Bay, which is located on the panhandle of Florida.

The strategic location of Florida makes it an important hub for trade and commerce, with several major ports, including the Port of Miami and the Port of Jacksonville. The region's proximity to the Caribbean and Latin America also makes it a popular destination for tourists and a key location for international business. Florida's borders are also home to several major cities, including Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville, which are known for their diverse cultures, rich history, and vibrant entertainment scenes.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Florida's terrain is characterized by its low-lying coastal plains, which are dotted with numerous lakes, rivers, and wetlands. The region's highest point, Britton Hill, is only 105 meters above sea level, making Florida one of the flattest states in the country. The landscape is also dominated by the **Everglades**, a vast network of wetlands that cover much of southern Florida. The Everglades are home to a diverse range of wildlife, including alligators, crocodiles, and numerous species of birds.

The state's coastline is also marked by several notable features, including the **Florida Keys**, a chain of islands that stretch from the southern tip of Florida to the Dry Tortugas. The Keys are known for their beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant coral reefs, making them a popular destination for snorkeling and diving. Florida's interior is also home to several major lakes, including Lake Okeechobee, which is the largest lake in the state.

The region's geology is also notable for its **karst topography**, which is characterized by sinkholes, caves, and underground rivers. This unique geology is the result of the state's underlying bedrock, which is composed of soluble rocks such as limestone and dolomite. Over time, the acidic rainfall has dissolved the rocks, creating a network of underground cavities and passageways.
