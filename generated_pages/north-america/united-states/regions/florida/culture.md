# Florida Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

Florida's culture is a unique blend of influences from its history, geography, and population, shaped by its strategic location as a gateway to the Caribbean and Latin America.

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Florida's cultural identity is defined by its diverse population, which includes people of European, African, Caribbean, and Latin American descent. The state's history, from its indigenous peoples to its Spanish and British colonial periods, has also played a significant role in shaping its culture. Key influences on Florida's culture include its Native American heritage, its role as a major immigration hub, and its proximity to the ocean, which has made it a popular destination for tourists and retirees. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Florida is also diverse, with significant populations of Hispanic, African American, and Caribbean people, and English being the primary language spoken.

The cultural identity of Florida is also reflected in its regional variations, with different parts of the state having distinct cultural characteristics. For example, the southern part of the state, particularly the Miami area, has a strong Latin American influence, while the northern part of the state has a more Southern American culture. The state's population is also characterized by a high level of mobility, with many people moving to Florida from other parts of the country or from abroad, which has contributed to its cultural diversity.
