Peak season: December to February. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: June to September and especially the summer months due to hot and humid weather, as well as the risk of hurricanes. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nFlorida has a subtropical climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by hot and humid weather, with frequent rain showers and a higher risk of hurricanes. The state's climate can be divided into three zones: the **Panhandle**, which has a more temperate climate; **Central Florida**, which has a subtropical climate; and **South Florida**, which has a tropical climate. Understanding these climate zones and seasons is essential to planning a trip to Florida.\n\nThe dry season is the best time to visit Florida, as the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities such as beach trips, hiking, and theme park visits. The peak season, which runs from December to February, is the busiest time of the year, with high prices and large crowds. The budget season, which runs from May to November, is a good time to visit for those on a tight budget, as prices are lower and crowds are smaller. However, the weather during this time can be hot and humid, and there is a higher risk of hurricanes.\n\nFlorida's seasons also affect travel in other ways. For example, the dry season is the best time to visit the state's many theme parks, such as **Walt Disney World** and **Universal Orlando**, as the weather is mild and pleasant. The wet season, on the other hand, is a good time to visit the state's many museums and indoor attractions, such as the **Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum** and the **Salvador Dali Museum**.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Mild, 70s-80s | Low | $ | Beach trips, outdoor activities |\n| February | Mild, 70s-80s | Med | $$ | Theme parks, festivals |\n| March | Warm, 80s-90s | High | $$$ | Spring break, outdoor activities |\n| April | Warm, 80s-90s | Med | $$ | Outdoor activities, beach trips |\n| May | Hot, 90s | Low | $ | Beach trips, water sports |\n| June | Hot, 90s | Med | $$ | Summer vacation, water parks |\n| July | Hot, 90s | High | $$$ | Summer vacation, outdoor activities |\n| August | Hot, 90s | Med | $$ | Back-to-school shopping, indoor activities |\n| September | Hot, 90s | Low | $ | Hurricane season, indoor activities |\n| October | Warm, 80s-90s | Med | $$ | Halloween events, outdoor activities |\n| November | Mild, 70s-80s | Low | $ | Thanksgiving, outdoor activities |\n| December | Mild, 70s-80s | High | $$$ | Holiday season, theme parks |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Miami Open** | March | A tennis tournament featuring top players from around the world |\n| **Florida Strawberry Festival** | March | A festival celebrating strawberries, with music, food, and activities |\n| **Key West Food and Wine Festival** | January | A festival featuring food, wine, and music from the Florida Keys |\n| **Universal Orlando Mardi Gras** | February-May | A celebration of Mardi Gras, with parades, music, and food |\n| **Miami Music Week** | March | A week-long celebration of music, with concerts and events throughout the city |\n| **Key West Lobsterfest** | August | A festival celebrating lobster, with food, music, and activities |\n| **Epcot International Food and Wine Festival** | August-November | A festival featuring food, wine, and music from around the world |\n| **Miami Book Fair** | November | A festival featuring authors, books, and literary events |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Panhandle** has a more temperate climate, with cooler winters and warmer summers, making it a good destination for outdoor activities such as hiking and biking.\n- **Central Florida** has a subtropical climate, with mild winters and hot, humid summers, making it a good destination for theme parks and outdoor activities.\n- **South Florida** has a tropical climate, with hot and humid weather year-round, making it a good destination for beach trips and water sports.\n- The **Florida Keys** have a unique climate, with a mix of tropical and subtropical weather, making it a good destination for snorkeling, diving, and fishing.\n- The **Everglades** have a unique ecosystem, with a mix of fresh and saltwater, making it a good destination for wildlife viewing and outdoor activities.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, which runs from April to May and September to November, for lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack accordingly, with light clothing and sunscreen for the dry season, and rain gear and insect repellent for the wet season.\n- Be aware of hurricane season, which runs from June to November, and have a plan in place in case of an emergency.\n- Avoid visiting during holidays such as Christmas and New Year's, as prices are high and crowds are large.\n- Consider purchasing travel insurance, which can provide protection in case of unexpected events such as hurricanes or trip cancellations.",
