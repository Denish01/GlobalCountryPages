[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Florida has a subtropical climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by hot and humid weather, with frequent rain showers and a higher risk of hurricanes. The state's climate can be divided into three zones: the **Panhandle**, which has a more temperate climate; **Central Florida**, which has a subtropical climate; and **South Florida**, which has a tropical climate. Understanding these climate zones and seasons is essential to planning a trip to Florida.

The dry season is the best time to visit Florida, as the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities such as beach trips, hiking, and theme park visits. The peak season, which runs from December to February, is the busiest time of the year, with high prices and large crowds. The budget season, which runs from May to November, is a good time to visit for those on a tight budget, as prices are lower and crowds are smaller. However, the weather during this time can be hot and humid, and there is a higher risk of hurricanes.

Florida's seasons also affect travel in other ways. For example, the dry season is the best time to visit the state's many theme parks, such as **Walt Disney World** and **Universal Orlando**, as the weather is mild and pleasant. The wet season, on the other hand, is a good time to visit the state's many museums and indoor attractions, such as the **Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum** and the **Salvador Dali Museum**.
