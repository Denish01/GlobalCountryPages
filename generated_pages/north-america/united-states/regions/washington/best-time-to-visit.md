[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Washington state has a diverse climate, ranging from the **oceanic climate** of the western coast to the **semi-arid climate** of the eastern region. The state can be divided into four main climate zones: the Pacific coast, the Puget Sound region, the Cascade Range, and the eastern plateau. The Pacific coast has a mild climate year-round, with significant rainfall during the winter months. The Puget Sound region has a similar climate, with more moderate temperatures and rainfall. The Cascade Range has a colder climate, with heavy snowfall during the winter months, while the eastern plateau has a **continental climate**, with cold winters and hot summers.

The dry season in Washington typically runs from June to September, with minimal rainfall and warm temperatures. This is the peak tourist season, with many visitors flocking to the state's national parks, beaches, and outdoor recreational areas. The wet season, from October to May, is characterized by significant rainfall and cooler temperatures. While this may not be the best time for outdoor activities, it is an ideal time for visiting museums, galleries, and indoor attractions.

The seasons in Washington have a significant impact on travel plans. During the peak season, popular destinations can become crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services may increase. In contrast, the off-season can offer more affordable prices and a more relaxed atmosphere, but some attractions and facilities may be closed or operate on reduced hours.
