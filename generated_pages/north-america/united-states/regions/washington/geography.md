[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Washington is situated in the northwest corner of the United States, with a unique geography that includes a diverse range of landscapes and climates. The state is bordered by the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north, Idaho to the east, and Oregon to the south. The Pacific Ocean forms the western border of the state, with a coastline that stretches for over 1,600 kilometers. This strategic location has made Washington an important hub for international trade and commerce, with the Port of Seattle being one of the busiest ports in the United States.

The state's borders are also home to several major mountain ranges, including the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range, which includes iconic peaks like Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens. These mountain ranges have played a significant role in shaping the state's geography and climate, with the rain shadow effect creating a dry and arid climate in the eastern part of the state. The Columbia River forms the southern border of the state, separating Washington from Oregon, and is an important source of hydroelectric power and irrigation for the region's agricultural industry.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Washington's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, forests, rivers, and coastlines. The Olympic Peninsula is home to some of the most pristine and untouched wilderness areas in the United States, with ancient forests, towering mountain peaks, and over 70 miles of coastline. The Cascade Range is another notable feature of the state's terrain, with snow-capped peaks, alpine lakes, and scenic valleys. The eastern part of the state is generally drier and more arid, with rolling hills, sagebrush steppe, and the scenic Columbia River Gorge.

The state's landscape has been shaped by millions of years of geological activity, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and erosion. The Puget Sound region, which includes the cities of Seattle and Tacoma, is a unique feature of the state's terrain, with a complex network of islands, inlets, and waterways. The sound is home to a diverse range of marine life, including orcas, seals, and salmon, and is an important source of seafood for the region. The state's terrain has also been shaped by human activity, with the construction of dams, roads, and other infrastructure having a significant impact on the landscape.

The state's rivers and streams are another important feature of its terrain, with the Columbia, Snake, and Yakima rivers being some of the most notable. These rivers have played a crucial role in shaping the state's landscape, with their valleys and canyons providing important habitats for a wide range of plant and animal species. The rivers have also been an important source of hydroelectric power, with the construction of dams like the Grand Coulee Dam and the Bonneville Dam having a significant impact on the region's energy production.
