[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Illinois is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, from the flat plains of the prairie to the rolling hills of the Shawnee National Forest. The state's terrain is generally flat, with an average elevation of around 180 meters above sea level.

The prairie is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including wildflowers, grasses, and animals such as deer, turkey, and pheasant. In addition to the prairie, Illinois is also home to several forests, including the Shawnee National Forest, which covers over 280,000 acres in the southern part of the state. The forest is home to a wide range of tree species, including oak, hickory, and pine, as well as several species of wildlife, including deer, turkey, and black bear.

The state's coastline along Lake Michigan is also an important feature of its landscape, with several major beaches and parks located along the lake's shoreline. The lake's shoreline is also home to several major cities, including Chicago, which is located on the southwestern shore of the lake. The lake's shoreline is also an important location for recreation, with several beaches, parks, and marinas located along its length.
