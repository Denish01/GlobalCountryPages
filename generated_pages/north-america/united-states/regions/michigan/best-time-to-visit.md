[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Michigan has a continental climate with four distinct seasons. The state can be divided into two main climate zones: the southern and western parts have a more moderate climate, while the northern and eastern parts are colder and more prone to **lake-effect snow**. The dry season typically occurs from September to April, while the wet season runs from May to August. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Michigan, with summer being the peak tourist season and winter being the least popular due to the cold weather. However, each season offers unique experiences, such as **skiing** and **snowmobiling** in the winter, **hiking** and **biking** in the spring and fall, and **beach activities** and **festivals** in the summer.

The state's location in the northern United States means that the winters are cold, with average temperatures ranging from 24°F to 34°F (-4°C to 1°C) in January, the coldest month. The summers are warm, with average temperatures ranging from 70°F to 82°F (21°C to 28°C) in July, the warmest month. The spring and fall seasons are mild, with average temperatures ranging from 40°F to 60°F (4°C to 15°C) in April and October, respectively.

Michigan's seasonal variations also affect the types of activities that can be enjoyed. For example, the **Upper Peninsula** is a popular destination for winter sports, while the **Lake Michigan shoreline** is ideal for summer beach activities. The **fall foliage** in the western and northern parts of the state is a major attraction, with the changing colors of the leaves creating a picturesque landscape.
