The state is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, but it is home to many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that provide water for irrigation, drinking, and recreation. The **Four Corners** region, where Colorado meets Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, is a unique geographical feature that marks the only point in the United States where four states meet at a single location.\n\nColorado's location in the interior of the North American continent means that it is far from the moderating influence of the ocean, resulting in a **continental climate** with large diurnal temperature ranges and low humidity. The state's geography is also characterized by the **Rocky Mountains**, which run along its western edge and provide a dramatic backdrop for many of Colorado's cities and towns. The mountains also create a range of microclimates, from the arid **high desert** of the western slope to the more humid and temperate **foothills** of the eastern slope.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nColorado's terrain is incredibly diverse, with a range of landscapes that reflect its complex geological history. The **Rocky Mountains** dominate the western part of the state, with peaks reaching elevations of over 4,000 meters. The mountains are home to many **alpine lakes**, **glaciers**, and **ski resorts**, and offer a wide range of outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, and skiing. The **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** and the **San Juan Mountains** are two of the most prominent mountain ranges in the state, with peaks that are popular with hikers and climbers.\n\nIn addition to its mountains, Colorado is also home to a range of **rivers**, including the **Colorado River**, the **Arkansas River**, and the **Rio Grande**, which flow through the state and provide water for irrigation, drinking, and recreation. The **Great Plains** cover the eastern part of the state, with rolling hills and grasslands that are home to many **ranches** and **farms**. The **Colorado Plateau**, which covers the western part of the state, is a high, dry region with a unique landscape of **mesas**, **canyons**, and **buttes**.\n\nThe state's diverse terrain and landscape support a wide range of **ecosystems**, from the **alpine tundra** of the highest mountains to the **desert shrublands** of the western slope. The **montane forests**, which cover much of the state, are home to many **tree species**, including **aspen**, **spruce**, and **fir**. The **grasslands** of the eastern part of the state are home to many **wildflowers**, including **prairie clover** and **blue grama**.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter | December to February | -10°C to 10°C | 30-60 cm | Cold, snowy, and icy |\n| Spring | March to May | 10°C to 20°C | 30-60 cm | Mild, with occasional snow and thunderstorms |\n| Summer | June to August | 20°C to 30°C | 20-40 cm | Warm, dry, and sunny |\n| Fall | September to November | 10°C to 20°C | 20-40 cm | Cool, with occasional snow and frost |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to October and March to May.
