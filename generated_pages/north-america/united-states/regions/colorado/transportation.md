For those traveling overland, Colorado is bordered by several neighboring states, including Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Utah, making it easily accessible by car or bus. The main entry points for overland travelers are along the interstate highways, such as I-25, I-70, and I-76, which connect Colorado to other parts of the country.
