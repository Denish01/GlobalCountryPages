[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Colorado is situated in the western United States, bordered by seven states: Wyoming to the north, Nebraska and Kansas to the northeast and east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, and Utah and Arizona to the west. The state is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, but it is home to many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that provide water for irrigation, drinking, and recreation. The **Four Corners** region, where Colorado meets Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, is a unique geographical feature that marks the only point in the United States where four states meet at a single location.

Colorado's location in the interior of the North American continent means that it is far from the moderating influence of the ocean, resulting in a **continental climate** with large diurnal temperature ranges and low humidity. The state's geography is also characterized by the **Rocky Mountains**, which run along its western edge and provide a dramatic backdrop for many of Colorado's cities and towns. The mountains also create a range of microclimates, from the arid **high desert** of the western slope to the more humid and temperate **foothills** of the eastern slope.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Colorado's terrain is incredibly diverse, with a range of landscapes that reflect its complex geological history. The **Rocky Mountains** dominate the western part of the state, with peaks reaching elevations of over 4,000 meters. The mountains are home to many **alpine lakes**, **glaciers**, and **ski resorts**, and offer a wide range of outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, and skiing. The **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** and the **San Juan Mountains** are two of the most prominent mountain ranges in the state, with peaks that are popular with hikers and climbers.

In addition to its mountains, Colorado is also home to a range of **rivers**, including the **Colorado River**, the **Arkansas River**, and the **Rio Grande**, which flow through the state and provide water for irrigation, drinking, and recreation. The **Great Plains** cover the eastern part of the state, with rolling hills and grasslands that are home to many **ranches** and **farms**. The **Colorado Plateau**, which covers the western part of the state, is a high, dry region with a unique landscape of **mesas**, **canyons**, and **buttes**.

The state's diverse terrain and landscape support a wide range of **ecosystems**, from the **alpine tundra** of the highest mountains to the **desert shrublands** of the western slope. The **montane forests**, which cover much of the state, are home to many **tree species**, including **aspen**, **spruce**, and **fir**. The **grasslands** of the eastern part of the state are home to many **wildflowers**, including **prairie clover** and **blue grama**.
