[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Arizona is a complex network of public and private providers, with a strong emphasis on quality care. The state has a high number of **board-certified physicians** and **specialized hospitals**, making it an attractive destination for medical tourism. However, like many parts of the United States, Arizona's healthcare system is not without its challenges, particularly in rural areas where access to care can be limited. The state has made significant strides in expanding **Medicaid** coverage to low-income individuals and families, but many residents still struggle with **health insurance affordability**. Despite these challenges, Arizona's healthcare system is considered to be of high quality, with many top-ranked hospitals and medical centers.

In terms of access to care, urban areas like Phoenix and Tucson have a wide range of medical facilities and specialists, while rural areas often have limited options. This can make it difficult for rural residents to access specialized care, and may require them to travel long distances to receive treatment. However, the state has implemented **telemedicine programs** to help bridge this gap and provide rural residents with access to medical specialists.

Arizona's healthcare system is also influenced by its large **Native American population**, with many tribal communities having their own healthcare systems and facilities. These systems often face unique challenges, including limited resources and funding, but are working to provide high-quality care to their communities.
