[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Arizona has a diverse range of climates, from the **desert** regions in the south to the **mountainous** regions in the north. The state experiences a dry and hot summer season, with very little rainfall, and a mild winter season, with most of the rainfall occurring between December and March. The spring and fall seasons are the best times to visit, with mild temperatures and wildflowers in bloom. The summer season is characterized by extremely high temperatures, often reaching over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult for outdoor activities. The winter season is mild, but can be cool in the mornings and evenings, especially in the northern regions.

The climate in Arizona varies significantly depending on the region. The **Sonoran Desert**, which covers the southern part of the state, is known for its hot and dry climate, while the **Colorado Plateau**, which covers the northern part of the state, has a cooler and more temperate climate. The **mountainous regions**, such as Flagstaff and the White Mountains, have a more moderate climate, with cold winters and mild summers. Understanding the different climate zones in Arizona is essential for planning a trip and making the most of your time in the state.

The seasons in Arizona have a significant impact on travel and outdoor activities. During the peak season, which runs from December to February, popular destinations such as the **Grand Canyon** and **Sedona** can be crowded, and prices for accommodations and tours may be higher. The budget season, which runs from June to August, is characterized by low prices and smaller crowds, but the heat can be overwhelming, making it difficult to enjoy outdoor activities. The spring and fall seasons offer the best balance of weather and crowds, making them the ideal times to visit Arizona.
