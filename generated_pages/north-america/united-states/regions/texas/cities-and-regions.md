[SECTION] How Texas Is Divided [/SECTION]
Texas is a large and diverse state in the southern United States, divided into 254 counties, each with its own government and administration. The state is not divided into provinces or states, but rather into regions, which are often referred to as "areas" or "zones". These regions are typically defined by their geographic characteristics, economic activities, or cultural identities. For example, the Gulf Coast region is known for its beaches and oil refineries, while the Hill Country is famous for its rolling hills and wineries.

The state's administrative structure is headed by the governor and the legislature, which are responsible for making laws and governing the state. The counties, on the other hand, have their own governments, which are responsible for providing local services such as law enforcement, education, and infrastructure. This system allows for a significant degree of autonomy at the local level, enabling counties to respond to the unique needs and challenges of their residents.
