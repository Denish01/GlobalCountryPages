The state's dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by hot and dry weather, while the wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by cool and rainy weather. The seasons can greatly affect travel in California, with the summer months being the busiest and most expensive, and the winter months being the coolest and wettest.\n\nThe **coastal regions**, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, tend to have a more moderate climate, with cool and foggy summers and mild winters. The **inland regions**, such as the Central Valley and the deserts, tend to have a more extreme climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The **mountainous regions**, such as the Sierra Nevada, tend to have a cold and snowy climate, with many roads and attractions closed during the winter months.\n\nThe seasons can also affect the types of activities and attractions that are available in California. For example, the summer months are ideal for **beach activities**, such as surfing and swimming, while the winter months are better suited for **skiing and snowboarding**.
