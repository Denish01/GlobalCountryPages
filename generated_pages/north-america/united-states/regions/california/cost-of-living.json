[/SECTION]\nCalifornia is one of the most expensive regions in the United States, with a high cost of living that is significantly above the national average. The state's desirable climate, beautiful landscapes, and thriving economy, particularly in the tech and entertainment industries, contribute to its expensive lifestyle. Compared to other states, California's cost of living is higher than most, with only a few states like New York and Hawaii having similar or higher costs.
