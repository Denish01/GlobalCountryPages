The state is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, but it has a significant coastline along Lake Erie to the northwest. The Delaware River forms the southeastern border, while the Susquehanna River flows through the center of the state. Pennsylvania's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and commerce throughout its history.\n\nThe state's borders have been shaped by its complex geological history, with the Appalachian Mountains forming a significant portion of its western and central regions. The state's terrain has also been influenced by the numerous rivers and streams that flow through it, including the Delaware, Susquehanna, and Allegheny rivers. These waterways have played a crucial role in shaping the state's landscape and have provided a source of power and transportation for its inhabitants.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nPennsylvania's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, from the rugged Appalachian Mountains in the west to the flat coastal plains in the east. The state can be divided into several distinct regions, each with its own unique geological features. The Appalachian Mountains, which cover about half of the state, are a dominant feature of the landscape, with numerous peaks and valleys. The mountains are home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including black bears, white-tailed deer, and wild turkeys.\n\nThe state's central region is dominated by the **Allegheny Plateau**, a vast area of flat to gently sloping terrain that covers much of western and central Pennsylvania. This region is home to numerous rivers, streams, and lakes, including the Allegheny River and Lake Erie. The plateau is also home to a wide range of agricultural activities, including farming and forestry. In contrast, the southeastern part of the state is characterized by the **Piedmont** region, a flat to gently sloping area of terrain that is home to many of the state's major cities, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n\nThe state's landscape has also been shaped by its **glacial history**, with numerous lakes, rivers, and wetlands formed by the movement of ice sheets during the last ice age. The **Pocono Mountains**, located in northeastern Pennsylvania, are a popular destination for outdoor recreation, with numerous ski resorts, hiking trails, and waterfalls. The mountains are also home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including black bears, bobcats, and white-tailed deer.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 10-20°C | 80-100 mm | mild, unpredictable |\n| Summer | June to August | 20-30°C | 100-120 mm | hot, humid |\n| Autumn | September to November | 10-20°C | 80-100 mm | cool, colorful |\n| Winter | December to February | -10 to 0°C | 50-70 mm | cold, snowy |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to November and March to May.
