# United States Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in the United States is well-developed, with a comprehensive network of roads, railways, airports, and ports, as well as a reliable energy and water supply system, although there are still significant urban-rural gaps and areas for improvement.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 93%
Road Network: 160,955 km, high-quality highways and interstates
Rail Network: 224,792 km
Major Airports: 482
Major Ports: 95
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The United States has a highly developed infrastructure, with significant investments in recent years to upgrade and expand its transportation networks, energy systems, and public utilities. However, there are still notable disparities between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to high-speed internet, reliable public transportation, and modern amenities. The federal government has launched initiatives to address these gaps, including the **American Jobs Plan**, which aims to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure development and upgrade projects across the country.

The United States is also home to some of the world's busiest and most modern airports, seaports, and logistics hubs, which play a critical role in facilitating international trade and commerce. The country's infrastructure is supported by a robust network of **public-private partnerships**, which have helped to finance and deliver many large-scale infrastructure projects in recent years. Despite these strengths, the United States still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including aging roads and bridges, congested airports, and vulnerable energy systems.
