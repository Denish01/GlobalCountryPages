  "content": "The cost of healthcare in the United States can vary significantly depending on the type of care, location, and insurance coverage, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 10.9% of total health spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $12,979 (estimated based on GDP per capita PPP: $85,810)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 10.9% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed (Private / Public)\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe United States has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private providers. The quality of care is generally high, but the cost can be significant, especially for those without insurance. Locals typically have access to a range of healthcare options, including employer-sponsored insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid, while foreigners may need to purchase private insurance or pay out-of-pocket for care. The system can be complex, and navigating it can be challenging, especially for those who are not familiar with the healthcare landscape. In general, public healthcare facilities, such as community clinics, may offer lower-cost options, while private hospitals and specialist care can be more expensive.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has expanded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, but the system remains imperfect, and many people still struggle to access affordable care. For foreigners, it is highly recommended to have some form of insurance coverage, as medical bills can be substantial. Many private insurance companies offer plans specifically designed for expats and international visitors, which can provide access to a network of healthcare providers and help to mitigate the cost of care. It is essential to research and understands the different options available, including the costs, benefits, and limitations of each plan.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$200 | $100-$500 | Costs vary by location and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$500 | $200-$1,000 | Higher costs for specialist care |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$200 | $100-$500 | Routine cleanings and exams |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$200 | $100-$500 | Basic eye exams and glasses prescriptions |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$100 | $50-$200 | Costs vary by lab and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $500-$2,000 | Costs vary by hospital and severity |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $1,000-$5,000 | Higher costs for intensive care |\n| Basic Surgery | $2,000-$10,000 | Costs vary by procedure and surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $5,000-$20,000 | Higher costs for cesarean sections |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$2,000 | Costs vary by location and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Routine X-rays for diagnostic purposes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $500-$1,500 | Extended coverage, including specialist care and prescriptions |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, including emergency evacuations and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be expensive, with costs ranging from $10 to $100 or more per month, depending on the type and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as pain relievers and antihistamines, are generally affordable, with prices starting from $5-$10.\n- Pharmacy availability is widespread, with many chain stores and independent pharmacies in most cities.\n- Prescription rules vary by state, but generally require a doctor's note and identification.\n- Some medications, such as antibiotics and controlled substances, may require additional documentation or authorization.\n- It is essential to check with your insurance provider to see if your medications are covered and to understand any copays or deductibles.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial 911 or visit the nearest emergency room. Ambulance services are widely available, and many hospitals have dedicated emergency departments. For foreigners, it is crucial to have a plan in place, including insurance coverage and a list of emergency contacts. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in the United States include those with international patient departments, such as NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. These hospitals often have staff who speak multiple languages and can provide culturally sensitive care. It is also a good idea to research local hospitals and medical facilities before an emergency arises, to ensure that you know where to go and what to expect.",
