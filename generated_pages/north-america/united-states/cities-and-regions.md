[SECTION] How United States Is Divided [/SECTION]
The United States is a federal republic, with a system of government that divides power between the federal government and the individual states. The country is divided into 50 states, each with its own capital, government, and laws. In addition to the states, the United States also has a federal district, Washington D.C., which serves as the capital of the country. The states are further divided into counties, cities, and towns, each with their own local governments and laws. This system of government allows for a great deal of autonomy and diversity among the different states and regions, which is reflected in the unique character and culture of each area.

The division of the United States into different regions is not strictly defined, but is generally based on geographic, cultural, and economic factors. The country can be broadly divided into regions such as the Northeast, South, Midwest, and West Coast, each with its own distinct character and identity. These regions are further subdivided into smaller areas, such as the New England states in the Northeast, the Southern states, the Great Plains in the Midwest, and the Pacific Northwest on the West Coast.
