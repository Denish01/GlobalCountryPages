However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the location, with cities like New York and San Francisco tend to have higher utility costs compared to other parts of the country. Additionally, there can be seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher costs during the winter months for heating and during the summer months for cooling.\n\nThe overall cost of utilities in the United States is also influenced by the country's **inflation rate**, which is currently at 3.0% (2024), and the **GDP per capita PPP**, which is $85,810 (2024). This can impact the affordability of utilities, especially for low-income households. Furthermore, the **out-of-pocket health spend** is 10.9% (2023), which may leave some households with limited budget for utility expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | varies by location and usage |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | includes sewage and trash |\n| Gas / Heating | $30 | $50 | $70 | only applicable in certain regions |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | separate fee in some cities |\n| **Total** | **$140** | **$215** | **$280** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10-20 Mbps | Verizon, AT&T |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 100-500 Mbps | Comcast, Spectrum |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $20-40 | 5-10 GB | T-Mobile, Cricket Wireless |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $40-80 | 10-50 GB | Verizon, AT&T |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | Comcast, Verizon |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $15 | 2 screens, HD |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | individual plan |\n| Local Streaming | $10-20 | varies by provider and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's best to contact the service providers directly and provide proof of identity and address.\n- Consider prepaid electricity plans, which can help budget and avoid surprise bills.\n- For internet, choose a provider that offers a reliable connection and a data allowance that suits your needs.\n- To save on bills, turn off lights and appliances when not in use, and consider investing in energy-efficient devices.\n- Look for bundle deals that combine internet, phone, and TV services, which can often be cheaper than separate plans.",
