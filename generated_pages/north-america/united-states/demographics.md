[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The United States is the third most populous country in the world, with a population size that is approximately 4.3% of the world's total population. The country's population has been steadily growing over the years, with a growth rate of 0.7% per annum. This growth rate is driven by a combination of natural increase (the difference between births and deaths) and net migration (the difference between the number of people moving into the country and those moving out). The population of the United States is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 87% of the population residing in urban areas. This trend is expected to continue, with many people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities, education, and healthcare.

The population of the United States is also characterized by significant migration patterns. The country has a long history of immigration, with people from all over the world moving to the United States in search of a better life. This has resulted in a diverse population, with people from different ethnic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds. The majority of immigrants come from Latin America, Asia, and Europe, with many settling in urban areas such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami.

The population of the United States is also aging, with the median age increasing over the years. This has significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social security programs.
