[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The United States has a well-developed transportation network, with various modes of transport available, including public transit, taxis, ride-hailing services, and personal vehicles. The quality of public transit varies significantly between cities, with major cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago having comprehensive public transit systems, while smaller cities and rural areas often have limited options. Most people in the United States rely on personal vehicles for transportation, with approximately 90% of households owning at least one car.

However, there is a growing trend towards using public transit, walking, and cycling, particularly in urban areas. Many cities are investing in improving their public transit systems, including expanding bike-share programs and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Additionally, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft have become increasingly popular, providing an alternative to traditional taxis and public transit. With the rise of these services, the transportation landscape in the United States is becoming more diverse and convenient.
