[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The United States has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a wide range of service providers offering electricity, gas, water, and garbage collection services. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the location, with cities like New York and San Francisco tend to have higher utility costs compared to other parts of the country. Additionally, there can be seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher costs during the winter months for heating and during the summer months for cooling.

The overall cost of utilities in the United States is also influenced by the country's **inflation rate**, which is currently at 3.0% (2024), and the **GDP per capita PPP**, which is $85,810 (2024). This can impact the affordability of utilities, especially for low-income households. Furthermore, the **out-of-pocket health spend** is 10.9% (2023), which may leave some households with limited budget for utility expenses.
