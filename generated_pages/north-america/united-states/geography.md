The United States is situated in the northern and western hemispheres, with its territory spanning across much of North America. It shares a 8,893 km long border with Canada to the north and a 3,201 km long border with Mexico to the south. The country is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the northwest, with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. The unique geography of the United States, with its extensive coastline and diverse neighboring countries, has played a significant role in shaping the country's history, culture, and economy.

The United States is also home to several territories and insular areas, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands, which are located in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. These territories are not part of any state and are instead governed by the federal government. The geographic location of the United States, with its access to the world's major oceans and its proximity to other countries, has made it a global leader in trade, commerce, and international relations.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of the United States is incredibly diverse, with mountains, rivers, deserts, forests, and coastlines that stretch across the country. The western United States is home to some of the most impressive mountain ranges in the world, including the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range.

The eastern United States is characterized by a mix of rolling hills, forests, and coastal plains, with the Appalachian Mountains stretching from Canada to Alabama. The country's vast river systems, including the Mississippi, Missouri, and Rio Grande, have played a crucial role in shaping the landscape and supporting agriculture, industry, and urban development. The Great Plains, a vast grassland that stretches from Canada to Mexico, is home to some of the most productive farmland in the world. The diverse terrain and landscape of the United States have also created a wide range of ecosystems, from the tropical rainforests of Hawaii to the arctic tundras of Alaska.
