Major Airports: 2
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The infrastructure in Turks and Caicos is characterized by a high level of development, with a strong focus on supporting the tourism industry. Recent investments have been made in upgrading the road network, expanding the airport, and improving the energy and water supply systems. However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with the capital Cockburn Town and the main tourist areas having better infrastructure than the more remote islands. The government has been working to address this issue, with projects aimed at improving access to basic services such as electricity, water, and telecommunications in rural areas.

The territory's infrastructure has also been impacted by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which have caused significant damage to buildings, roads, and utilities. As a result, there is a need for ongoing investment in maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure to ensure it can withstand future disasters. The government has been working with international partners to secure funding and expertise to support these efforts.

Despite these challenges, the overall quality of life in Turks and Caicos is high, with access to modern amenities and services. The territory's infrastructure is well-suited to supporting the tourism industry, which is the main driver of the economy. However, there is a need for ongoing investment and maintenance to ensure that the infrastructure continues to meet the needs of the growing population and economy.
