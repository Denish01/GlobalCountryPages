[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Turks and Caicos has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with a range of options available for getting around the islands. The most common modes of transportation are taxis, rental cars, and buses, with many visitors also opting to use bikes or walk. The quality of public transit is generally good, with regular bus services connecting the main towns and villages. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many people rely on private vehicles or taxis to get around.

The majority of people in Turks and Caicos get around by car, with many residents owning their own vehicles. However, for visitors, there are plenty of alternative options available, including taxi services, bike rentals, and guided tours. The islands are relatively small, making it easy to get around without a car, and many of the main attractions are within walking distance of each other. Additionally, the **Turks and Caicos Tourist Board** provides a range of transportation options, including shuttle services and guided tours, to help visitors get around the islands.
