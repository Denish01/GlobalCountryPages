This results in higher prices for staples like **meat**, **dairy products**, and **fresh produce**.

Many locals opt to buy **fresh seafood** and **local produce** from markets and roadside vendors, which can be a more cost-effective and flavorful alternative to imported goods. Additionally, some restaurants offer **traditional Turks and Caicos cuisine**, which often features fresh seafood, conch, and other local ingredients at a lower price point than international dishes.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $4-$6 | $4-$6 USD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $3-$5 | $3-$5 USD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $4-$6 | $4-$6 USD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2-$4 | $2-$4 USD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $10-$15 | $10-$15 USD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $15-$25 | $15-$25 USD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $8-$12 | $8-$12 USD | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $5-$8 | $5-$8 USD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $4-$6 | $4-$6 USD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $3-$5 | $3-$5 USD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $12-$18 | $12-$18 USD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $3-$5 | $3-$5 USD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$20 | (conch fritters, fish sandwiches) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$40 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $50-$80 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $100-$150 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $6-$8 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$12 | |\n| Cappuccino | $5-$8 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $3-$5 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to grocery shopping, **supermarkets** tend to offer a wider selection of imported goods, but at a higher price point than **local markets**.
