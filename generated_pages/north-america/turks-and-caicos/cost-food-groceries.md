[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The cost of food in Turks and Caicos is influenced by the island's **import-based economy**, with most goods being shipped in from the United States and other countries. This results in higher prices for staples like **meat**, **dairy products**, and **fresh produce**. Eating out is a popular activity in Turks and Caicos, with many restaurants catering to tourists and locals alike. However, due to the high cost of ingredients and labor, dining out can be expensive, with meals at mid-range restaurants costing upwards of $50-$80 USD for two people.

Additionally, some restaurants offer **traditional Turks and Caicos cuisine**, which often features fresh seafood, conch, and other local ingredients at a lower price point than international dishes.
