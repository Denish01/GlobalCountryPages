[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Turks and Caicos is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer wait times and limited resources. Locals and foreigners can access both public and private healthcare services, although foreigners may be required to pay out-of-pocket for services or have insurance that covers them. The government of Turks and Caicos recommends that all residents and visitors have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.

In general, the public healthcare system in Turks and Caicos is funded by the government and provides basic medical services to locals and visitors. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, is funded by private insurance and out-of-pocket payments, and offers a wider range of services and higher quality care. Many medical professionals in Turks and Caicos are trained in the United States or the United Kingdom, and the private healthcare system is generally considered to be on par with that in developed countries. However, medical services can be expensive, and visitors are advised to have adequate health insurance coverage before arriving in the country.
