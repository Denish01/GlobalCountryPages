The territory's proximity to the Bahamas and Haiti has influenced its cultural and historical development, with many residents maintaining strong ties to these neighboring countries.

The territory's borders are defined by its coastline, with the Bahamas to the northwest and Haiti to the southeast. The **Windward Passage**, which separates Cuba from Haiti, is also nearby.
