[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of the Turks and Caicos Islands is based on a parliamentary system, where the **Premier** is the head of government and is responsible for advising the **Governor**, who represents the **Monarch**. The **House of Assembly** is the unicameral legislature, composed of 15 members, who are elected by the people for a term of four years. The government is divided into three branches: the **Executive**, **Legislative**, and **Judicial**, with a system of checks and balances to ensure that no one branch has too much power. The **Constitution** of the Turks and Caicos Islands, which came into effect in 2011, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the different branches.

The **Separation of Powers** is an important principle in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where the **Executive** is responsible for the administration of the government, the **Legislative** is responsible for making laws, and the **Judicial** is responsible for interpreting laws. The government is also divided into different **Ministries**, each responsible for a specific area of governance, such as **Education**, **Health**, and **Finance**. The **Premier** and the **Cabinet** are responsible for making key decisions and advising the **Governor** on important matters.

The Turks and Caicos Islands are a **Unitary State**, where the central government has the power to make laws and decisions for the entire territory. However, there are also **Local Governments** in each of the islands, which have some degree of autonomy and are responsible for providing local services such as **Waste Management** and **Road Maintenance**.
