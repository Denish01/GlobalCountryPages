[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Turks and Caicos has a tropical marine climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by low humidity, plenty of sunshine, and gentle breezes. This is the best time to visit the islands, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and beach-hopping. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by higher humidity, occasional rain showers, and a higher risk of hurricanes. During this time, some hotels and tourist facilities may close or reduce their operations, and the islands may be less crowded.

The climate in Turks and Caicos is influenced by its location in the Atlantic Ocean, and the trade winds that blow from the east. The islands' geography, with their low-lying coral reefs and sandy beaches, also plays a role in shaping the local climate. The temperature in Turks and Caicos remains relatively consistent throughout the year, with average highs ranging from 75°F to 85°F (24°C to 30°C). However, the risk of hurricanes and tropical storms increases during the wet season, and visitors should be aware of the potential risks and take necessary precautions.

The seasons in Turks and Caicos have a significant impact on travel and tourism. During the peak season, which runs from December to February, the islands are bustling with visitors, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are at their highest. The shoulder season, which runs from April to May and from September to November, offers a good balance between weather, crowds, and prices. Visitors who are looking for a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices may prefer to visit during the off-season, but they should be aware of the potential risks associated with the wet season.
