The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer wait times and limited resources. Locals and foreigners can access both public and private healthcare services, although foreigners may be required to pay out-of-pocket for services or have insurance that covers them. The government of Turks and Caicos recommends that all residents and visitors have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\nIn general, the public healthcare system in Turks and Caicos is funded by the government and provides basic medical services to locals and visitors. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, is funded by private insurance and out-of-pocket payments, and offers a wider range of services and higher quality care. Many medical professionals in Turks and Caicos are trained in the United States or the United Kingdom, and the private healthcare system is generally considered to be on par with that in developed countries. However, medical services can be expensive, and visitors are advised to have adequate health insurance coverage before arriving in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$250 | $250-$500 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$250 | |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $200-$500 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, surgeries, diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Emergency medical evacuations, worldwide coverage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $10-$50 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and cost between $5-$20\n- Pharmacies are available in major towns and cities, but may have limited hours of operation\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a local doctor\n- Prices for medications can vary depending on the pharmacy and location\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, visitors to Turks and Caicos should call 911 or visit the nearest hospital.
