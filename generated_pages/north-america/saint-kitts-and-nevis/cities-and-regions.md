Saint Kitts and Nevis is a sovereign nation located in the Caribbean, consisting of two main islands.

The parishes serve as the primary administrative divisions, with each parish having its own local government and responsibilities. The capital city, Basseterre, is located on the island of Saint Kitts and serves as the center of government, commerce, and culture.
