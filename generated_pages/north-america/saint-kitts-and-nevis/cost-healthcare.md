[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Saint Kitts and Nevis is a mixed system, combining both public and private providers. Public healthcare is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, with longer wait times and limited resources. Locals and foreigners can access both public and private healthcare services, but foreigners may be required to pay out-of-pocket for services or have international health insurance. The public healthcare system is generally geared towards providing basic medical care to the local population, while private healthcare providers offer more specialized and advanced medical services.

The healthcare system in Saint Kitts and Nevis is not universal, and locals often rely on a combination of public and private services. Foreigners, on the other hand, are advised to have international health insurance or purchase local insurance to cover their medical expenses. Many private healthcare providers in Saint Kitts and Nevis have partnerships with international insurance companies, making it easier for foreigners to access quality medical care. However, it is essential to note that medical facilities and services may be limited, especially in emergency situations, and medical evacuation to another country may be necessary in severe cases.
