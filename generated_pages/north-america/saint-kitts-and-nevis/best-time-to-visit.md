[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Kitts and Nevis has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by higher humidity and more frequent rainfall, with the most significant risk of **hurricanes** in September and October. The climate is relatively consistent throughout the islands, with average temperatures ranging from 70°F to 85°F (21°C to 30°C) throughout the year.

The dry season is the peak tourist season, with the most visitors arriving between December and April. This is the best time for outdoor activities such as **hiking**, **beach trips**, and **water sports**. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices for accommodations and activities. However, some tourists may still prefer to visit during the wet season to take advantage of the lower prices and fewer crowds.

The seasons can affect travel plans, especially during the hurricane season. It is essential to check the weather forecast before traveling and to have a plan in place in case of a hurricane warning. Additionally, some tourist facilities and attractions may be closed during the wet season, so it's crucial to research and plan ahead.
