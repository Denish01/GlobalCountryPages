        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Saint Kitts and Nevis is a sovereign country located in the Caribbean, with a rich history dating back to the pre-Columbian era. The first inhabitants of the islands were the <strong>Arawak</strong> and <strong>Carib</strong> peoples, who migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1493, Christopher Columbus sighted the islands on his second voyage to the New World, and they were subsequently claimed by the Spanish. However, it was the British who established the first permanent settlement on the islands in 1624, with the French also establishing settlements in the 17th century.</p>
        <p>The British and French fought over the islands for many years, with the British ultimately gaining control of Saint Kitts in 1713 and Nevis in 1782. The islands were used for sugar production, with enslaved Africans being brought to the islands to work on the plantations. The British abolished slavery in 1834, and the islands became a British colony. Saint Kitts and Nevis gained internal self-government in 1967, and on September 19, 1983, the country gained full independence from the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Saint Kitts and Nevis is a member of the <strong>Commonwealth of Nations</strong> and the <strong>Organization of Eastern Caribbean States</strong>. The country has a parliamentary democracy, with a prime minister as head of government and a governor-general representing the monarch. The country's economy is primarily based on tourism, with a growing focus on financial services and offshore banking.</p>
        <p>The country's history has had a significant impact on its culture, with a mix of African, British, and Caribbean influences. The country celebrates several national holidays, including Independence Day on September 19 and National Heroes Day on September 16. The country's cuisine is also a reflection of its history, with popular dishes such as <strong>conch fritters</strong> and <strong>pepper pot soup</strong>.</p>
