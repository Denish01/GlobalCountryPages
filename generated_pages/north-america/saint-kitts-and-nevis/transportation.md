[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main airport in Saint Kitts and Nevis is the Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport, located in Basseterre, which receives direct flights from major hubs such as Miami, New York, and London. You can also fly into the Vance W. Amory International Airport in Nevis, although this airport is smaller and has fewer direct flights. Both airports offer connections to other Caribbean islands, making it easy to island-hop. If you're coming from a nearby island, you can also take a ferry, which is a more affordable and scenic option.

If you're planning to visit Saint Kitts and Nevis from outside the Caribbean, you'll likely need to fly into one of the major airports and then connect to a smaller airline or take a ferry. The country has a relatively simple overland entry point system, with most visitors arriving by air or sea. There are no land borders to speak of, as the country is an island nation. You can also take a cruise ship to Saint Kitts and Nevis, which is a popular way to visit the islands.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Saint Kitts and Nevis has a limited domestic air network, with most flights operating between the two main islands. The main domestic airline is Winair, which offers regular flights between Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport and Vance W. Amory International Airport. You can book flights online or through a local travel agent, and prices start from around $100 USD for a one-way ticket. It's worth noting that flights can be subject to change, so it's a good idea to check with the airline for the latest schedules and prices.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in Saint Kitts and Nevis, so you won't be able to take a train to get around the islands. The country's terrain and size make it difficult to build a rail network, and the focus has been on developing the road network instead. If you're looking for a scenic way to see the islands, you might consider taking a ferry or a taxi tour instead.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are several bus companies that operate on the islands, offering regular services between the main towns and villages. The buses are generally affordable, with prices starting from around $2 USD for a one-way ticket. You can pay the driver in cash, and it's a good idea to have some local currency with you. The buses can be a good way to see the islands and meet locals, but they may not always run to a strict schedule, so be prepared for some flexibility.
