[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Alberta's healthcare system is publicly-funded, which means that all residents are covered for medically necessary services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries. The system is managed by Alberta Health Services (AHS), a provincial health authority that oversees healthcare delivery across the province. The quality of care in Alberta is considered to be among the best in Canada, with well-trained healthcare professionals, modern facilities, and access to the latest medical technology. However, like many universal healthcare systems, there can be wait times for non-emergency procedures, and some services may not be covered, such as cosmetic procedures or prescription medications.

In terms of access, urban areas like Calgary and Edmonton have a high concentration of healthcare facilities and specialists, while rural areas may have more limited options. However, AHS has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including telehealth services and community health centers. Overall, Alberta's healthcare system is designed to provide comprehensive, high-quality care to all residents, regardless of their income or social status.

The public healthcare system in Alberta is supplemented by a private sector that offers additional services, such as private clinics and insurance plans. These private services can provide faster access to care, additional amenities, and more comprehensive coverage, but they often come at a cost. As a result, many Albertans choose to purchase private insurance to supplement their public coverage and gain access to these additional services.
