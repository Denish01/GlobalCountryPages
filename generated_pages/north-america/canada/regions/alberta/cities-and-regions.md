[SECTION] How Alberta Is Divided [/SECTION]
Alberta is a province in western Canada, bordered by the provinces of British Columbia to the west, Saskatchewan to the east, and the Northwest Territories to the north. The province is divided into several administrative regions, including specialized municipalities, metropolitan areas, and regional services commissions. These divisions provide a framework for delivering public services, managing infrastructure, and promoting economic development. The province is also home to several Indigenous communities, each with their own distinct culture and traditions.

The administrative divisions in Alberta are designed to reflect the province's diverse geography and economy.
