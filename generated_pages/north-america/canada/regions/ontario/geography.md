[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Ontario is situated in the eastern part of Canada, covering a vast area of over 1 million square kilometers. The region borders the Great Lakes, including Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior, which provide a significant portion of its coastline. To the north, Ontario is bounded by the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield, which includes the Hudson Bay and James Bay. The region shares international borders with the United States to the south, where it meets the states of Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.

The location of Ontario has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The region's proximity to the Great Lakes has made it an important hub for trade and commerce, with many major cities, including Toronto and Ottawa, situated on the shores of the lakes. The border with the United States has also had a significant impact on the region's development, with many Ontario cities and towns having strong economic and cultural ties to their American counterparts.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Ontario is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, from the rugged Canadian Shield in the north to the fertile plains of the south. The region is home to many major rivers, including the Ottawa River, the Saint Lawrence River, and the Niagara River, which flows over the famous Niagara Falls. The landscape is also dotted with numerous lakes, including the Great Lakes, which provide a significant source of freshwater and support a wide range of aquatic life. The Canadian Shield, which covers much of northern Ontario, is a vast expanse of Precambrian rock that has been shaped by millions of years of erosion and glaciation.

In the south, the landscape is generally flatter and more fertile, with many areas of agricultural land and urban development. The region is also home to many major forests, including the boreal forest, which covers much of northern Ontario and provides a habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including bears, wolves, and moose. The Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve, runs along the western edge of the province and features a unique landscape of cliffs, valleys, and waterfalls.

The diverse landscape of Ontario has played a significant role in shaping the region's economy and culture. The abundance of natural resources, including timber, minerals, and freshwater, has made Ontario an important hub for industry and trade. The region's many lakes, rivers, and forests have also made it a popular destination for outdoor recreation, with many opportunities for hiking, camping, fishing, and hunting.
