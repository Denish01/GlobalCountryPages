This system is based on the Canada Health Act, which ensures that all Canadians have access to necessary medical care. The quality of care in Ontario is considered to be among the best in the world, with well-trained medical professionals, modern equipment, and a wide range of specialized services. However, there can be differences in access to care between urban and rural areas, with longer wait times and fewer specialized services available in rural regions. Despite these challenges, the overall quality of care in Ontario is high, with a strong emphasis on preventive care, public health initiatives, and community-based services.\n\nIn terms of public vs private services, the majority of healthcare services in Ontario are provided through the public system, with some private clinics and hospitals offering specialized services, such as cosmetic surgery or private diagnostic testing. These private services are not typically covered by the public system, and patients may need to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance to access them. Overall, the mix of public and private services in Ontario provides a wide range of options for patients, from essential medical care to specialized and elective services.\n\nThe structure of the healthcare system in Ontario is based on a network of hospitals, clinics, and community health centers, which provide a range of services, from emergency care to chronic disease management. The system is overseen by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, which sets policies and guidelines for healthcare services across the province. This helps to ensure that all residents have access to high-quality care, regardless of their location or income level.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n| Facility | Location | Type |
