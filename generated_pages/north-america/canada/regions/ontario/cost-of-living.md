[SECTION] How Expensive Is Ontario? [/SECTION]
Ontario is one of the most populous and economically developed regions in Canada, and its cost of living reflects this. Compared to global averages, Ontario is considered to be a relatively expensive place to live, with prices for accommodations, food, and transportation higher than in many other parts of the world. However, within North America, Ontario's prices are generally in line with those in other major cities in the United States and Canada. The region's diverse economy, high standard of living, and popular tourist destinations all contribute to its moderate to high cost of living.

In comparison to its neighbors, Ontario's prices are similar to those in Quebec and British Columbia, but higher than in many other provinces in Canada. The region's proximity to the United States and its major cities, such as Toronto and Ottawa, also means that prices for certain goods and services, such as accommodations and transportation, can be influenced by international demand.
