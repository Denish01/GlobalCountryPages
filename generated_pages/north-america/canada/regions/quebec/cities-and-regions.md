[SECTION] How Quebec Is Divided [/SECTION]
Quebec is divided into 17 administrative regions, each with its own regional county municipality. These regions are further divided into local municipalities, which can be either cities, towns, or villages. The provincial government is responsible for providing various services to the regions, including healthcare, education, and transportation. The administrative divisions are designed to provide a framework for delivering these services and for promoting economic development and social welfare in each region.

The regional county municipalities play a crucial role in the administration of Quebec, as they are responsible for providing various services to the local municipalities, including road maintenance, waste management, and social services. The municipalities also have a significant degree of autonomy, allowing them to make decisions on local issues and to develop their own economic development strategies. This system of governance allows for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability, enabling Quebec to respond effectively to the diverse needs of its regions and communities.
