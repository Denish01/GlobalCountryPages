The province's unique blend of traditions is reflected in its dishes, which often feature local ingredients such as maple syrup, game meats, and fresh seafood. Quebec's cuisine also varies by region, with the southern regions near the US border exhibiting more American influences, while the northern regions showcase more traditional French-Canadian dishes. The province's culinary scene is also shaped by its strong agricultural industry, with many farms and producers supplying fresh produce, meats, and dairy products to local restaurants and markets.\n\nThe French influence on Quebec's cuisine is particularly evident in the province's love of rich, savory sauces and intricate pastries. Many traditional Quebec dishes, such as **Tourtière** (a meat pie) and **Sugar Pie** (a dessert made with maple syrup), have their roots in French cuisine. However, Quebec's cuisine has also been shaped by its indigenous peoples, who introduced European settlers to new ingredients and cooking techniques. The result is a unique and flavorful cuisine that is distinctly Quebecois.\n\nQuebec's food culture is also closely tied to its social and cultural traditions. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds. In rural areas, traditional dishes such as **Pea Soup** and **Baked Beans** are often served at community gatherings and family reunions. In urban areas, restaurants and cafes serve as popular gathering places, where friends and colleagues can meet to enjoy a meal or a cup of coffee.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Poutine | Side dish | French fries topped with cheese curds and gravy | Restaurants and food trucks throughout the province |\n| Tourtière | Main dish | A traditional meat pie made with pork, beef, and vegetables | Restaurants and bakeries in the Quebec City area |\n| Sugar Pie | Dessert | A sweet pie made with maple syrup, sugar, and cream | Bakeries and cafes throughout the province |\n| Pea Soup | Soup | A hearty soup made with split peas, pork, and vegetables | Restaurants and cafes in rural areas |\n| Smoked Meat Sandwich | Sandwich | A sandwich made with smoked meat, mustard, and pickles | Delis and restaurants in Montreal |\n| Quebecois Crepes | Dessert | Thin pancakes filled with fruit, cream, or sugar | Creperies and cafes throughout the province |\n| Baked Beans | Side dish | Beans baked in a sweet and tangy sauce | Restaurants and cafes in rural areas |\n| Foie Gras | Appetizer | A dish made with the liver of a duck or goose, often served with toast or crackers | Upscale restaurants in Montreal and Quebec City |\n| Tarte au Sucre | Dessert | A sugar pie made with maple syrup, sugar, and cream, often served with a crust made from flour and butter | Bakeries and cafes throughout the province |\n| Cretons | Appetizer | A dish made with ground pork, onions, and spices, often served with toast or crackers | Restaurants and cafes in rural areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Poutine** from a street vendor, $5-$7 USD\n- **Smoked Meat Sandwich** from a deli, $10-$12 USD\n- **Sugar Pie** from a bakery, $5-$7 USD\n- **Maple Taffy** from a street vendor, $3-$5 USD\n- **Quebecois Crepes** from a creperie, $8-$10 USD\n- **Fried Dough** from a street vendor, $4-$6 USD\n- **BeaverTails** (a pastry topped with cinnamon sugar) from a street vendor, $5-$7 USD\n- **Hot Dogs** from a street vendor, $4-$6 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Maple Syrup Coffee**, a coffee made with pure maple syrup, $3-$5 USD\n- **Quebecois Beer**, a selection of local beers, $6-$8 USD\n- **Caribou**, a sweet, fortified wine made with maple syrup and other ingredients, $8-$10 USD\n- **Apple Cider**, a refreshing drink made from local apples, $4-$6 USD\n- **Ice Cider**, a sweet, dessert wine made from frozen apples, $10-$12 USD\n- **Spruce Beer**, a beer made with spruce tips, $6-$8 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Table manners are generally formal, with an emphasis on using utensils and waiting for the host to indicate where to sit\n- Tipping is customary, with 15% to 20% of the total bill expected\n- Reservations are often necessary, especially in popular restaurants\n- Dress codes vary, but smart casual attire is generally acceptable\n- Meal times are often seen as opportunities to socialize and enjoy good company\n- It is customary to wait for the host to invite you to start eating before beginning your meal\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Restaurants**, offering a range of traditional and modern Quebec dishes\n- **Cafes**, serving coffee, pastries, and light meals\n- **Bakeries**, offering fresh bread, pastries, and desserts\n- **Food Trucks**, serving street food and snacks\n- **Markets**, offering a range of local produce, meats, and specialty foods\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Marché Jean-Talon**, a public market in Montreal offering a range of local produce, meats, and specialty foods\n- **Marché de Noël**, a Christmas market in Quebec City offering traditional holiday foods and drinks\n- **Sugar Shack**, a traditional Quebecois experience where visitors can enjoy maple syrup and other local treats\n- **Food Tour of Montreal**, a guided tour of the city's culinary scene, offering samples of local dishes and drinks\n- **Quebec City Food Festival**, an annual festival showcasing the province's culinary delights, with food stalls, cooking demonstrations, and live music.",
