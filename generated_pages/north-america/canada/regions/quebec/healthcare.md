[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Quebec's healthcare system is a publicly-funded, universal system, providing access to medical services for all residents, regardless of income or social status. The system is managed by the **Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ)**, which oversees the provision of healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and medical procedures. The quality of care in Quebec is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. However, like many healthcare systems, there can be variations in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have more specialized services and shorter wait times.

The healthcare system in Quebec is primarily public, with most medical services provided by public hospitals and clinics. However, there are also private clinics and medical facilities that offer specialized services, often with shorter wait times and more personalized care. In general, the public system provides comprehensive coverage for essential medical services, while private clinics may offer additional services, such as cosmetic surgery or private rooms.

Access to healthcare in rural areas can be more limited, with fewer medical facilities and specialists available. However, the Quebec government has implemented initiatives to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the use of **telemedicine** and mobile health clinics. Despite these challenges, the overall quality of care in Quebec is high, and the system is well-regarded for its comprehensiveness and accessibility.
