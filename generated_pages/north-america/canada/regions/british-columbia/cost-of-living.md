[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]
- Consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October) when prices are lower and the weather is still mild.
- Look for accommodation options outside of the city center, such as in nearby neighborhoods or suburbs, where prices may be lower.
- Take advantage of the province's many free or low-cost outdoor activities, such as hiking or visiting local parks and beaches.
- Eat at local eateries or food trucks, which can be more affordable than mid-range restaurants.
- Use public transportation instead of taxis or rental cars, which can be expensive.
- Consider buying a used bike or renting one for the duration of your stay, which can be a cost-effective way to get around.
