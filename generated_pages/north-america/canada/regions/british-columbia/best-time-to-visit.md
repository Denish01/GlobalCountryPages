[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
British Columbia is a vast and geographically diverse province, with a range of climate zones that vary from the mild and wet conditions of the coastal regions to the cold and dry conditions of the interior. The province experiences a wet season from October to March, with the majority of its annual rainfall occurring during these months. The dry season, which runs from April to September, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, making it the best time to visit for outdoor enthusiasts. The seasons can significantly affect travel in British Columbia, with some roads and attractions closing during the winter months due to heavy snowfall and maintenance.

The province's climate zones are divided into several distinct regions, including the coastal region, which includes the cities of Vancouver and Victoria, and the interior region, which includes the cities of Kelowna and Kamloops. The coastal region is known for its mild and wet climate, with significant rainfall throughout the year. The interior region, on the other hand, is characterized by a dry and cold climate, with cold winters and warm summers.

The seasons also play a significant role in shaping the province's tourism industry, with the summer months being the peak season for tourists. During this time, popular attractions and destinations can become crowded, and prices for accommodations and activities tend to be higher. However, the summer months also offer a wide range of outdoor activities, including hiking, camping, and water sports, making it an ideal time to visit for those who enjoy the outdoors.
