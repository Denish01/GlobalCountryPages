# The Truth About Canada - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Canada's history began with the arrival of indigenous peoples thousands of years ago. The first European explorers, including **Viking** Leif Erikson and **French** Jacques Cartier, arrived in the 10th and 16th centuries, respectively. In 1534, Cartier claimed the land for France, and it became a French colony. The French and **British** fought for control of the territory, with the British ultimately gaining control through the **Treaty of Paris** in 1763. The **British North America Act** of 1867 united the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada (which became Quebec and Ontario) under a single government, forming the Dominion of Canada. Canada gained independence from the United Kingdom through the **Statute of Westminster** in 1931.

The early history of Canada was marked by the **French and Indian War** (1754-1763) and the **American Revolution** (1775-1783), which had significant impacts on the country's development. The **Act of Union** in 1840 united Upper and Lower Canada, and the **Canadian Confederation** in 1867 brought together the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada. The **National Policy** of 1879, introduced by Prime Minister **John A. Macdonald**, aimed to promote Canadian industry and unity.

Canada's history has been shaped by the interactions between European settlers and indigenous peoples. The **Indian Act** of 1876, which remains in effect today, governs the relationship between the Canadian government and indigenous peoples. The **Residential School System**, which operated from the 1870s to the 1990s, had a profound impact on indigenous communities. In recent years, Canada has acknowledged the historical injustices faced by indigenous peoples and has taken steps towards reconciliation.

The 20th century saw significant developments in Canada, including the **World Wars** and the **Cold War**. Canada played an important role in both World Wars and was a founding member of the **United Nations**. The country has continued to evolve, with significant events such as the **Quebec Referendum** in 1980 and the **Charlottetown Accord** in 1992.
