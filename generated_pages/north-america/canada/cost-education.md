[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Canada's education system is highly regarded globally, with a strong emphasis on public education that is generally free or subsidized for residents. The quality of public education is high, with well-qualified teachers and a comprehensive curriculum that includes both English and French as languages of instruction, reflecting the country's bilingual nature. Compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary school, and is overseen by each province or territory, which allows for some variation in curriculum and standards. For expatriates or those seeking an international curriculum, there are numerous private and international schools available across the country, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate (IB), British, American, and French systems.

The public education system in Canada is funded through taxes and is generally of high quality, making it an attractive option for both locals and expatriates. However, private education offers more flexibility in terms of curriculum and class size, and can be particularly appealing to those seeking a specific type of education that may not be available in the public system. International schools, while more expensive, provide a global curriculum that can be beneficial for children of expatriates or those planning to pursue higher education abroad. The language of instruction in public schools is either English or French, depending on the province, while private and international schools may offer instruction in other languages as well.
