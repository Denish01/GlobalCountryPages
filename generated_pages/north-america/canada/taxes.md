[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Canada has a **territorial taxation** system, which means that individuals are taxed on their worldwide income if they are considered residents of Canada for tax purposes. Residency rules for tax purposes are based on factors such as the number of days spent in Canada, ownership of a home, and family ties. Generally, individuals who spend more than 183 days in Canada in a calendar year are considered residents for tax purposes.

The Canadian tax system is administered by the **Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, processing tax returns, and enforcing tax laws. Canada also has a network of tax treaties with other countries to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion. These treaties can provide relief from taxation in both countries for individuals and businesses with international income.
