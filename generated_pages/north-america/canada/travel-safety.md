Canada is generally a very safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other countries. The country has a strong reputation for being welcoming and friendly to tourists, with a high level of social cohesion and respect for the law. However, as with any country, there are areas that are considered safer than others, and tourists should take normal precautions to protect themselves and their belongings. Major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal are generally safe, with low crime rates and a strong police presence.

Despite the overall safety of Canada, there are some areas that tourists should be aware of.
