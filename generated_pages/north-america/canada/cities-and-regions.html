        <h2>How Canada Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Canada is a vast and diverse country, divided into 10 provinces and 3 territories. The provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon. Each province and territory has its own government and is responsible for delivering various public services such as healthcare, education, and transportation. The federal government, on the other hand, is responsible for matters such as national defense, foreign policy, and trade.</p>
        <p>The administrative structure of Canada is designed to balance the needs and interests of the different regions and provinces. The provinces have a significant degree of autonomy, which allows them to tailor their policies and programs to meet the unique needs of their residents. The federal government, however, plays an important role in ensuring that the country as a whole is working together and that the interests of all Canadians are being represented.</p>
