[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Canadian cuisine is defined by its cultural diversity, with influences from French, British, and indigenous peoples. The country's vast geography and climate also play a significant role in shaping its cuisine, with different regions specializing in unique ingredients and dishes. For example, the Maritime provinces are known for their seafood, while the prairies are famous for their beef and wheat. Canadian cuisine is also characterized by its love of comfort food, with popular dishes like **Tourtière** (a traditional Quebecois meat pie) and **Butter Tarts** (a classic Canadian dessert).

Canada's food culture is also shaped by its immigrant communities, with many restaurants serving dishes from around the world. **Chinatowns** in cities like Vancouver and Toronto offer a wide range of Chinese cuisine, while **Little Italy** in Montreal serves up delicious Italian dishes. The country's indigenous peoples also have a rich culinary tradition, with popular dishes like **Three Sisters Soup** (made with corn, beans, and squash) and **Bannock** (a type of fried bread).

Regional variations also play a significant role in Canadian cuisine, with different provinces and territories having their own unique specialties. For example, **Nova Scotia** is known for its seafood, particularly **Lobster** and **Mussels**, while **Quebec** is famous for its **Sugar Shacks**, where maple syrup is produced. **British Columbia** is known for its **Salmon**, while **Alberta** is famous for its **Beef**.
