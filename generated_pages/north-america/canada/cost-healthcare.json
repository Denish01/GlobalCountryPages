  "content": "In Canada, healthcare costs vary depending on the type of service, location, and whether you are a local or a foreigner, with the average health expenditure per capita being around $6,378 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $6,378\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 15.3%\nHealthcare System: Public\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended for non-residents\nCurrency: CAD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nCanada has a **public healthcare system**, which provides universal access to medical services for its citizens and permanent residents. The system is funded through taxes and is designed to provide comprehensive and universal coverage. However, the quality of care can vary depending on the province and territory, with some areas having better facilities and more specialized services than others. For locals, the system is generally easy to navigate, with most medical services being covered by the public system. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is often recommended that they purchase private health insurance to cover any medical expenses.\n\nThe Canadian healthcare system is divided into different provinces and territories, each with its own **healthcare administration**. While the system is generally public, there are some private clinics and services available, particularly in larger cities like Toronto and Vancouver. These private services can offer faster access to specialized care and more luxurious facilities, but they often come at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is essential to research the specific healthcare options available in the area they plan to visit or live in, as well as to understand the requirements for accessing public or private healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $0-$50 | $50-$200 | Public system covers most GP visits, but private clinics may charge more |\n| Specialist Consultation | $0-$100 | $100-$500 | Public system covers specialist visits, but wait times can be long |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$300 | Public system does not cover dental care, except for children and low-income individuals |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$100 | $100-$300 | Public system covers eye exams for children and seniors, but not for adults |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $0-$20 | $20-$50 | Public system covers most blood tests, but private labs may charge more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $0-$500 | Public system covers most emergency visits, but private hospitals may charge more |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $0-$1,000 | Public system covers most hospital stays, but private rooms may cost more |\n| Basic Surgery | $0-$5,000 | Public system covers most surgeries, but private clinics may charge more for elective procedures |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $0-$2,000 | Public system covers most childbirth services, but private hospitals may charge more for luxury facilities |\n| MRI Scan | $0-$1,000 | Public system covers most MRI scans, but private clinics may charge more for expedited services |\n| X-Ray | $0-$100 | Public system covers most X-rays, but private clinics may charge more for specialized services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$500 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist visits and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$1,000 | Covers medical services for foreigners, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and dosage\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and can cost between $5-$20 per item\n- Prescription rules vary by province, but most require a doctor's prescription to purchase medication\n- Pharmacies are widely available in most cities and towns, with many open 24 hours\n- Common medications like pain relievers and antihistamines can cost between $5-$10 per pack\n- Some pharmacies offer discounted prices for certain medications or loyalty programs for frequent customers\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is essential to call 911 or visit the nearest hospital emergency room. Ambulance services are widely available, and most hospitals have emergency departments that can handle a wide range of medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is recommended to research the best hospitals in the area they plan to visit or live in, as well as to understand the requirements for accessing emergency care. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Canada include the University Health Network in Toronto and the Vancouver General Hospital in Vancouver. These hospitals have international patient departments and offer a range of specialized services, including emergency care and surgery.\n\nWhen accessing emergency care in Canada, it is essential to have some form of identification and proof of insurance, if applicable. The emergency department staff will typically assess the patient's condition and provide treatment accordingly. In some cases, patients may be required to pay out-of-pocket for certain services, such as ambulance transportation or prescription medications. However, most emergency services are covered by the public healthcare system, and patients can expect to receive high-quality care regardless of their ability to pay. [CALLOUT] It is crucial to note that while emergency care is widely available, wait times can be long, and some services may not be covered by the public system.",
