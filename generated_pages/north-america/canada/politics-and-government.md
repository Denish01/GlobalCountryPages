[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Canadian government is divided into three branches: the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial**. The executive branch is headed by the **Prime Minister**, who is the head of government, while the **Monarch** serves as the head of state. The legislative branch is composed of the **House of Commons** and the **Senate**, which make up the **Parliament of Canada**. The judicial branch is composed of the **Supreme Court of Canada** and other lower courts. Canada's system of government is based on the principles of **federalism**, which divides power between the federal and provincial levels. The federal government has authority over matters such as national defense, foreign policy, and trade, while the provinces have authority over matters such as healthcare, education, and natural resources.

The **separation of powers** is an important principle in the Canadian system of government, which ensures that no one branch of government has too much power. The **House of Commons** is elected by the people, while the **Senate** is appointed by the **Governor General** on the advice of the **Prime Minister**. The **Supreme Court of Canada** has the final say on matters of **constitutional law** and ensures that the government acts in accordance with the **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**.

Canada's **federal system** allows for a great deal of autonomy for the provinces, which are responsible for delivering many public services. However, the federal government also plays an important role in providing funding and setting national standards for these services. This system allows for a balance between national unity and regional diversity, and has helped to promote **economic development** and **social cohesion** across the country.
