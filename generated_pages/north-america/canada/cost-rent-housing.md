[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Canada's rental market is highly competitive, particularly in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver, where rental vacancy rates are low and prices are high. Typical lease terms for rentals in Canada are 12 months, with some flexibility for shorter or longer leases depending on the landlord and the tenant's needs. Deposit requirements usually range from one to two months' rent, and tenant rights are protected under provincial and territorial laws. Compared to its regional neighbors, Canada's housing costs are relatively high, with the United States having lower housing prices in many areas. However, Canada's housing market is also known for its stability and security, making it an attractive option for many renters and buyers.

The Canadian housing market is subject to fluctuations based on factors like location, economy, and government policies. The country's housing prices have been increasing steadily over the years, with some areas experiencing more significant growth than others. The rental market is also influenced by the availability of housing stock, with some cities facing shortages of affordable housing options. As a result, renters and buyers need to be prepared to act quickly when they find a suitable property, and to be flexible with their expectations and budget.
