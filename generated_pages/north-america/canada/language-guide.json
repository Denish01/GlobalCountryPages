There are distinct regional dialects, with Quebec being predominantly French-speaking, while the rest of the country is predominantly English-speaking. Additionally, there are many minority languages spoken across the country, reflecting the diverse cultural heritage of Canada's immigrant population. English is widely understood and spoken across the country, making it relatively easy for tourists and visitors to communicate and navigate.\n\nThe country's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the more than 200 languages spoken by its population, including many Indigenous languages. Despite this diversity, English and French remain the dominant languages in most aspects of Canadian life, including government, education, media, and business. Regional dialects and accents can vary significantly, with distinct variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. For example, the accents in the Maritime provinces, such as Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, are often distinct from those in Western Canada.\n\nCanada's language policies aim to promote the equality of English and French, with both languages being used in federal government services, courts, and institutions. This bilingualism is a key aspect of Canadian identity and is reflected in the country's language laws and policies. However, the use of English and French can vary significantly depending on the region, with some areas being predominantly English-speaking and others being predominantly French-speaking.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Bonjour (French), Hello (English) | bone-JOOR | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Merci (French), Thank you (English) | mur-SEE | formal/informal |\n| Please | S'il vous plaît (French), Please (English) | see voo play | formal |\n| Yes / No | Oui / Non (French), Yes / No (English) | wee / nohn | formal/informal |\n| Excuse me | Excusez-moi (French), Excuse me (English) | ex-KOO-zay mwah | formal |\n| How much? | Combien ça coûte?
