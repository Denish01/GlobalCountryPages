The quality of public transit varies by city, but most major cities have a comprehensive network of buses, subways, and commuter trains. In general, most people in Canada get around using their personal vehicles, but public transit is a popular option in urban areas.\n\nThe country's vast geography and dispersed population mean that transportation costs can be high, especially for those living in rural areas.
