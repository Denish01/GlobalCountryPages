[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Canada's healthcare system is primarily publicly funded, with each province and territory responsible for delivering healthcare services to its residents. The system is based on the principles of universality, accessibility, comprehensiveness, and portability. While the majority of healthcare services are publicly funded, there are also private providers and services that are not covered by the public system. The quality of care in Canada is generally high, with well-trained healthcare professionals and modern facilities. However, there can be variations in access to healthcare services depending on the location, with urban areas typically having more specialized services and rural areas having more limited access.

The Canadian healthcare system is often described as a **single-payer system**, where the government pays for a large portion of healthcare services through taxes. This system is designed to provide comprehensive coverage for all citizens, regardless of income or social status. However, there are some services that are not covered by the public system, such as **dental care** and **prescription medications**, which may require private insurance or out-of-pocket payment.

Canada's healthcare system is also known for its **electronic health records** system, which allows healthcare providers to access patient information electronically. This system has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare services, and has also enhanced patient safety.
