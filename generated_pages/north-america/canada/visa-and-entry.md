# Canada Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Canada before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Canada has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, electronic travel authorization, and traditional visa requirements for different nationalities. Citizens of over 50 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and most European countries, can enter Canada without a visa for a specified period. However, some nationalities require a visa, while others need an electronic travel authorization (eTA) or a visa on arrival.

The country has a robust immigration system, with a range of programs and categories for different types of visitors, including tourists, business travelers, students, and workers. Visitors to Canada can expect a welcoming and efficient entry process, with modern airports and border crossings.
