[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Canada has a well-developed transportation network, with a variety of options available for getting around, including public transit, taxis, ride-hailing services, and personal vehicles. The quality of public transit varies by city, but most major cities have a comprehensive network of buses, subways, and commuter trains. In general, most people in Canada get around using their personal vehicles, but public transit is a popular option in urban areas.

The country's vast geography and dispersed population mean that transportation costs can be high, especially for those living in rural areas. However, many cities have invested in public transit infrastructure, making it a convenient and affordable option for residents and visitors. Additionally, the availability of ride-hailing services has increased in recent years, providing another option for getting around.
