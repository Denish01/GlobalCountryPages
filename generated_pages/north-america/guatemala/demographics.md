Furthermore, the population growth rate and urbanization trends are expected to continue, posing challenges for the country's infrastructure, services, and environmental sustainability.

The country's population is also affected by various social and economic factors, including poverty, inequality, and access to education and healthcare. These factors contribute to the complex demographic landscape of Guatemala, where certain groups, such as indigenous communities and women, face significant challenges and disparities.
