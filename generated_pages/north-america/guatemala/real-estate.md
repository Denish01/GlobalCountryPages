[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Guatemala is a growing and dynamic sector, with a mix of modern and traditional properties available. The market is primarily driven by the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas such as Guatemala City, where the population is increasing rapidly. The current market conditions are characterized by a steady increase in prices, with an average annual growth rate of 5-7%. However, the market is still relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region. The price trajectory is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the country's economic growth and the increasing demand for housing.

In terms of urban vs rural areas, the market is largely divided between the two. Urban areas such as Guatemala City and Antigua tend to have higher prices and a greater demand for modern amenities, while rural areas such as Lake Atitlan and the surrounding countryside offer a more traditional and peaceful way of life. The rural areas are also popular with tourists and expats, who are drawn to the natural beauty and relaxed pace of life.

The Guatemalan property market is also characterized by a strong rental market, with many foreigners and locals alike choosing to rent rather than buy. This is particularly true in urban areas, where the demand for rental properties is high and the supply is limited. As a result, rental yields are relatively high, making it an attractive option for investors.
