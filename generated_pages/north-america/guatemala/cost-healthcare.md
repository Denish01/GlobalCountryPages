[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Guatemala's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, with limited resources and long wait times, but it is often the only option for low-income Guatemalans. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality care and shorter wait times, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers more familiar standards of care and is often staffed by English-speaking medical professionals. However, it is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare.

The healthcare system in Guatemala is divided into three main sectors: the public sector, which includes hospitals and clinics run by the Ministry of Health; the private sector, which includes private hospitals and clinics; and the social security sector, which includes hospitals and clinics run by the Guatemalan Social Security Institute. While the public sector is generally underfunded, the private sector is well-equipped and offers high-quality care, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, but for foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred choice due to its higher quality and shorter wait times.

It is also recommended to research the local healthcare system and to have a plan in place in the event of a medical emergency, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital or clinic and having a means of communication, such as a **cell phone** or a **two-way radio**.
