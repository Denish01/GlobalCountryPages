[SECTION] How Guatemala Is Divided [/SECTION]
Guatemala is divided into 22 departments, each with its own capital and administrative structure. These departments are further divided into municipalities, which are the basic units of local government. The departments are grouped into several regions, including the Pacific Lowlands, the Highlands, and the Petén Basin. This division is based on geographical and cultural characteristics, with each region having its own unique identity and attractions.

The administrative structure of Guatemala is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services and the management of natural resources. The departments are responsible for providing basic services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the municipalities are responsible for local planning and development. The central government plays a key role in coordinating the activities of the departments and municipalities, and in providing support for regional development initiatives.
