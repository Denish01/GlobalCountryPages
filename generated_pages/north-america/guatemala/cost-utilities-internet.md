[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Guatemala's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with most urban areas having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The costs of utilities in Guatemala are generally stable, but can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the dry season (December to May) due to increased demand for air conditioning.

The Guatemalan government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and investments in renewable energy sources. However, the country still relies heavily on fossil fuels, which can contribute to price volatility. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the provider, with some companies offering more competitive rates than others. It's essential to research and compare prices before choosing a utility provider in Guatemala.
