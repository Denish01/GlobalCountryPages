Guatemala has a more diverse economy, with a stronger focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, which contributes to its relatively higher GDP per capita. Honduras, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a greater reliance on agriculture and remittances from abroad. As a result, Guatemala tends to have a higher cost of living, particularly in urban areas, but overall, it is still cheaper than Honduras. The difference in cost of living between the two countries is around 10-20%, with Guatemala being the more affordable option.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Guatemala has a more stable economy, with a lower inflation rate and a more diversified industrial base. Honduras, however, has faced more economic challenges, including higher inflation and a greater dependence on foreign aid. These factors contribute to the difference in cost of living between the two countries, with Guatemala being the more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees. Additionally, the cost of living in both countries can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guatemala (USD) | Honduras (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 300 | 16.7% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 180 | 220 | 18.2% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 550 | 18.2% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guatemala (USD) | Honduras (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 6 | 16.7% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 350 | 14.3% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 2.5 | 20% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1.5 | 2 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guatemala (USD) | Honduras (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 25 | 20% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 1.2 | 16.7% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 0.9 | 11.1% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guatemala (USD) | Honduras (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 80 | 100 | 20% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 35 | 14.3% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 12 | 16.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Guatemala (USD) | Honduras (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 600 | 700 | 14.3% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,000 | 1,200 | 16.7% |\n| Comfortable | 1,500 | 1,800 | 16.7% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Guatemala is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices around 15-20% lower than in Honduras\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries costing around 15-25% less\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices around 10-20% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with bills around 15-20% cheaper\n- **Honduras is cheaper for:**\n- Some tourist activities, such as visiting national parks and museums\n- Local handicrafts and souvenirs, which can be found at lower prices in Honduras\n- Certain types of accommodation, such as hostels and guesthouses, which can be cheaper in Honduras\n- Some types of food, such as seafood and traditional dishes, which can be found at lower prices in Honduras\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nGuatemala offers better value for expats, students, and retirees, with a lower cost of living and a more diverse range of amenities and services.
