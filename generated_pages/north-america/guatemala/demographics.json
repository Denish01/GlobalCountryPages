The country's population size is significant in the context of Central America, where it is the most populous country.

Urbanization is also on the rise, with around 55% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city, Guatemala City, and other major urban centers. Migration patterns in Guatemala are characterized by internal movement from rural to urban areas, as well as international migration, primarily to the United States.\n\nThe population of Guatemala is also characterized by a high percentage of youth, with approximately 40% of the population under the age of 18.
