  "content": "To get around in Guatemala, you can use a variety of transportation options, including domestic flights, buses, taxis, and rental cars, as well as explore the country on foot or by bike in its many scenic towns and cities.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): La Aurora International Airport (GUA)\nDomestic Air Network: moderate\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: Uber, local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nGuatemala has several international airports, with La Aurora International Airport (GUA) in Guatemala City being the main entry point for most visitors. This airport receives direct flights from major hubs in the United States, Mexico, and other Central American countries. You can also enter Guatemala overland from its neighboring countries, including Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador, by bus or car. The border crossings are generally straightforward, but be sure to research any specific requirements, such as visas or vaccinations, before making the trip.\n\nIn addition to La Aurora International Airport, there are smaller international airports in Flores (FRS) and Puerto Barrios (PBR) that receive flights from neighboring countries and the United States. These airports can be a more convenient option if you're planning to visit the northern or eastern parts of the country. Overland entry points are also numerous, with major bus companies like Pullman and Litegua offering daily services from neighboring countries. If you're driving, be sure to research any specific requirements, such as car insurance or permits, before crossing the border.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nGuatemala has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights between the country's main cities. The main domestic airlines are TAG Airlines and Avianca, which offer flights from Guatemala City to destinations like Flores, Puerto Barrios, and Quetzaltenango. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be high and availability limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 USD per person, depending on the route and time of year. You can book flights online through the airlines' websites or through a local travel agent.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nGuatemala has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. This is due to a combination of factors, including the country's mountainous terrain and the high cost of building and maintaining a rail system. As a result, most people rely on buses, taxis, or rental cars to get around. However, there are some tourist trains, like the **Ferrocarril de los Altos**, which offer scenic rides through the highlands, but these are primarily for sightseeing rather than transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nGuatemala has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect most major cities and towns. The main bus companies, like Pullman and Litegua, offer a range of services, from economy to first class, with varying levels of comfort and amenities. Prices are generally low, with fares starting from around $5 USD for a short trip, and routes cover most parts of the country. However, be aware that road conditions can be poor, especially in rural areas, and journeys can be slow and bumpy. It's also a good idea to research the bus company and route in advance, as some buses may not be as safe or reliable as others.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | major cities | $0.25-$1.00 | frequent, but often crowded |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $5-$10 | metered, but agree on price first |\n| Ride-Hailing | Guatemala City, Antigua | $5-$10 | Uber and local alternatives available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | some tourist areas | $5-$10 | not always available, negotiate price |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Guatemala, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a credit card to rent a car.\n- Road conditions in Guatemala can be poor, especially in rural areas, so be prepared for bumpy roads and potential delays.\n- Fuel costs are relatively low, with gasoline prices around $3.50 USD per gallon.\n- Car rental companies like Hertz and Avis have offices in major cities, but be sure to research and book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n- Hazards on the road can include aggressive drivers, pedestrians, and livestock, so be sure to drive defensively and carefully.\n- Consider renting a 4x4 vehicle if you plan to drive in rural areas or on rough roads.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded buses and markets.\n- Always agree on the price before getting into a taxi or tuk-tuk, and make sure the meter is working.\n- Download the **Waze** app to help navigate Guatemala's roads and traffic.\n- Consider using a reputable shuttle service or private transfer for airport pickups and drop-offs.\n- Be prepared for potential delays or cancellations due to weather or road conditions.\n- Learn some basic Spanish phrases, such as **\"¿Cuánto cuesta?\"** (how much does it cost?), to help you navigate transportation options.\n- Keep some local currency, **Quetzales**, on hand for small purchases and tips.",
