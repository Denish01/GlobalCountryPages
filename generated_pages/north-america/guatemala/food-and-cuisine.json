The indigenous Maya people have had a significant influence on the country's cuisine, with many traditional dishes still made with native ingredients such as corn, beans, and squash. The Spanish conquest also introduced new ingredients and cooking techniques, such as the use of meat and spices, which have been incorporated into Guatemalan cuisine. Regional variations are also evident, with different departments and towns having their own unique specialties and ingredients.\n\nGuatemalan cuisine is known for its bold flavors and vibrant colors, with many dishes featuring a combination of spices, herbs, and chilies. The country's cuisine is also heavily influenced by its geography, with coastal regions specializing in seafood dishes and highland regions focusing on meat and vegetable dishes. The use of traditional cooking methods, such as grilling and steaming, is also an important part of Guatemalan cuisine.\n\nGuatemalan cuisine is not just about the food, but also about the cultural and social context in which it is prepared and consumed. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring family and friends together, and traditional dishes are often served at special occasions such as festivals and celebrations. The country's cuisine is also closely tied to its history and cultural heritage, with many dishes having been passed down through generations.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pepián | Stew | Hearty stew made with meat, vegetables, and spices | traditional restaurants, Antigua |\n| Jocón | Chicken dish | Chicken cooked in a creamy sauce made with herbs and spices | high-end restaurants, Guatemala City |\n| Kak'ik | Soup | Spicy soup made with turkey, vegetables, and tortillas | traditional markets, Lake Atitlán |\n| Tamales | Steamed dish | Steamed corn dough filled with meat, vegetables, or cheese | street vendors, Chichicastenango |\n| Rellenitos | Fried dish | Fried plantains filled with meat, vegetables, or cheese | street vendors, Guatemala City |\n| Chiles Rellenos | Stuffed peppers | Roasted peppers stuffed with meat, vegetables, or cheese | traditional restaurants, Antigua |\n| Empanadas | Pastry | Flaky pastry filled with meat, vegetables, or cheese | bakeries, Quetzaltenango |\n| Pupusas | Grilled dish | Grilled corn tortillas filled with meat, vegetables, or cheese | street vendors, San Salvador |\n| Churrasco | Grilled meat | Grilled steak served with beans, rice, and tortillas | high-end restaurants, Guatemala City |\n| Arroz con Pollo | Chicken dish | Chicken and rice cooked with spices and vegetables | traditional restaurants, Lake Atitlán |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Tostadas**: fried tortillas topped with beans, cheese, and vegetables, $1-2\n- **Fresh fruit**: fresh fruit such as mangoes, bananas, and pineapples, $0.50-1\n- **Roasted nuts**: roasted nuts such as peanuts and cashews, $1-2\n- **Tamales**: steamed corn dough filled with meat, vegetables, or cheese, $1-2\n- **Churros**: fried dough pastry coated in sugar, $1-2\n- **Elote**: grilled corn on the cob, $0.50-1\n- **Pupusas**: grilled corn tortillas filled with meat, vegetables, or cheese, $1-2\n- **Fresh juice**: fresh juice made with fruits such as orange, mango, and pineapple, $1-2\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Fresh coffee**: coffee made from locally-grown coffee beans, $1-2\n- **Horchata**: sweet drink made with rice, cinnamon, and vanilla, $1-2\n- **Fresh juice**: fresh juice made with fruits such as orange, mango, and pineapple, $1-2\n- **Beer**: local beer such as Gallo and Brahva, $2-3\n- **Rum**: local rum made from sugarcane, $3-5\n- **Atol**: warm drink made with corn, milk, and cinnamon, $1-2\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with your hands**: it is common to eat with your hands, especially when eating traditional dishes such as tamales and pupusas\n- **Trying new foods**: Guatemalans are proud of their cuisine and encourage visitors to try new dishes\n- **Respecting local customs**: it is important to respect local customs and traditions, especially when eating in traditional restaurants or homes\n- **Tipping**: tipping is expected in restaurants and bars, 10% is standard\n- **Making reservations**: making reservations is recommended for high-end restaurants, especially on weekends\n- **Dress code**: dress code is casual, but it is recommended to dress modestly when eating in traditional restaurants or homes\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional restaurants**: traditional restaurants serve traditional Guatemalan dishes, such as Pepián and Jocón\n- **Street vendors**: street vendors serve a variety of street foods, such as tamales and pupusas\n- **Markets**: markets such as the Chichicastenango market serve a variety of traditional dishes and snacks\n- **Food courts**: food courts in shopping malls serve a variety of international and local dishes\n- **High-end restaurants**: high-end restaurants serve modern Guatemalan cuisine, such as fusion dishes and gourmet meals\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Chichicastenango market**: traditional market that serves a variety of traditional dishes and snacks, located in Chichicastenango\n- **Antigua market**: market that serves a variety of traditional dishes and snacks, located in Antigua\n- **Lake Atitlán market**: market that serves a variety of traditional dishes and snacks, located in Lake Atitlán\n- **Guatemala City food tour**: food tour that takes visitors to different restaurants and markets to try traditional Guatemalan dishes, located in Guatemala City\n- **Coffee plantation tour**: tour that takes visitors to coffee plantations to learn about coffee production and taste local coffee, located in the highlands",
