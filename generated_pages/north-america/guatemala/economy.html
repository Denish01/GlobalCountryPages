        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Guatemala has a lower-middle-income economy, with a mix of traditional and modern industries. The country's economic development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with a GDP per capita of around $4,100. However, the economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, driven by a combination of factors such as remittances from abroad, foreign investment, and a growing tourism sector. Guatemala's economy is primarily driven by the services sector, which accounts for around 60% of the country's GDP, followed by industry and agriculture.</p>
        <p>The country's economic trajectory has been influenced by its strategic location in Central America, with a long coastline along the Pacific Ocean and a border with Mexico to the north. Guatemala has also been a member of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) since 2006, which has helped to increase trade with the United States and other countries in the region. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including high levels of poverty and inequality, as well as a lack of investment in infrastructure and human capital.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, Guatemala has made significant progress in recent years in terms of economic development, with a growing middle class and a increasing number of foreign investors. The country has also made efforts to diversify its economy, with a focus on developing new industries such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, and technology. Overall, Guatemala's economy has a lot of potential for growth and development, but it will require continued investment and reform to reach its full potential.</p>
