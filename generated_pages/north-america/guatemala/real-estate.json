The market is primarily driven by the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas such as Guatemala City, where the population is increasing rapidly. The current market conditions are characterized by a steady increase in prices, with an average annual growth rate of 5-7%. However, the market is still relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region. The price trajectory is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the country's economic growth and the increasing demand for housing.\n\nIn terms of urban vs rural areas, the market is largely divided between the two. Urban areas such as Guatemala City and Antigua tend to have higher prices and a greater demand for modern amenities, while rural areas such as Lake Atitlan and the surrounding countryside offer a more traditional and peaceful way of life. The rural areas are also popular with tourists and expats, who are drawn to the natural beauty and relaxed pace of life.\n\nThe Guatemalan property market is also characterized by a strong rental market, with many foreigners and locals alike choosing to rent rather than buy. This is particularly true in urban areas, where the demand for rental properties is high and the supply is limited. As a result, rental yields are relatively high, making it an attractive option for investors.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Guatemala City | 1,200 | 400 | Apartment |\n| Antigua | 1,500 | 600 | Colonial House |\n| Lake Atitlan | 800 | 300 | Rural House |\n| Quetzaltenango | 600 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Puerto Barrios | 400 | 150 | Beach House |\n| Flores | 500 | 250 | Island House |\n| Coban | 350 | 120 | Rural House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Guatemala, but they must obtain a **permiso de residencia** (residence permit) before completing the purchase.\n- Foreigners can also buy property through a **Guatemalan company**, which can provide additional tax benefits and flexibility.\n- There are some restrictions on foreign ownership of **rural land**, particularly in areas near the border with Mexico and Belize.\n- Foreigners must also obtain a **registration certificate** from the Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Affairs before buying property.\n- Foreigners can lease property for up to 50 years, with the option to renew for an additional 49 years.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
