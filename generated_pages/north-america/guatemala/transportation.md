[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Guatemala has several international airports, with La Aurora International Airport (GUA) in Guatemala City being the main entry point for most visitors. This airport receives direct flights from major hubs in the United States, Mexico, and other Central American countries. You can also enter Guatemala overland from its neighboring countries, including Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador, by bus or car. The border crossings are generally straightforward, but be sure to research any specific requirements, such as visas or vaccinations, before making the trip.

In addition to La Aurora International Airport, there are smaller international airports in Flores (FRS) and Puerto Barrios (PBR) that receive flights from neighboring countries and the United States. These airports can be a more convenient option if you're planning to visit the northern or eastern parts of the country. Overland entry points are also numerous, with major bus companies like Pullman and Litegua offering daily services from neighboring countries. If you're driving, be sure to research any specific requirements, such as car insurance or permits, before crossing the border.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Guatemala has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights between the country's main cities. The main domestic airlines are TAG Airlines and Avianca, which offer flights from Guatemala City to destinations like Flores, Puerto Barrios, and Quetzaltenango. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be high and availability limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 USD per person, depending on the route and time of year. You can book flights online through the airlines' websites or through a local travel agent.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Guatemala has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. This is due to a combination of factors, including the country's mountainous terrain and the high cost of building and maintaining a rail system. As a result, most people rely on buses, taxis, or rental cars to get around. However, there are some tourist trains, like the **Ferrocarril de los Altos**, which offer scenic rides through the highlands, but these are primarily for sightseeing rather than transportation.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Guatemala has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect most major cities and towns. The main bus companies, like Pullman and Litegua, offer a range of services, from economy to first class, with varying levels of comfort and amenities. Prices are generally low, with fares starting from around $5 USD for a short trip, and routes cover most parts of the country. However, be aware that road conditions can be poor, especially in rural areas, and journeys can be slow and bumpy. It's also a good idea to research the bus company and route in advance, as some buses may not be as safe or reliable as others.
