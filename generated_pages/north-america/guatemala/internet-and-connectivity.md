[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Guatemala has improved significantly over the years, offering relatively fast speeds in major cities like Guatemala City, Antigua, and Quetzaltenango. However, the urban-rural divide is still pronounced, with rural areas often experiencing slower speeds and less reliable connections. In urban areas, internet services are generally stable, with most providers offering a range of plans to suit different needs and budgets. Nevertheless, power outages and maintenance can still cause service disruptions, especially during the rainy season.

Despite these challenges, Guatemala's internet infrastructure has been expanding, with many providers investing in fiber-optic networks and 4G coverage. This has enabled more people to access the internet, particularly in urban areas, where the majority of the population is concentrated. As a result, tourists and digital nomads can generally expect to find reliable internet connections in major cities and tourist destinations, although it's always a good idea to research specific locations and providers before arriving.

These carriers have stores and authorized retailers throughout the country, including at airports and major tourist destinations. To buy a SIM card, you'll typically need to provide a valid passport and pay a small fee, usually around 10 USD. Claro and Tigo are popular options among tourists, offering a range of prepaid plans with data, voice, and text services. Movistar is another major carrier with a strong presence in Guatemala, although its plans and pricing may vary.
