[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Guatemala is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is elected by popular vote for a four-year term and is limited to two terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral Congress of the Republic, made up of 160 members who are also elected by popular vote for four-year terms. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court of Justice, which is composed of 13 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Congress.

The separation of powers in Guatemala is designed to provide checks and balances on each branch of government. The President has the power to appoint ministers and other high-ranking officials, but the Congress has the power to approve or reject these appointments. The Congress also has the power to impeach the President and other high-ranking officials. The Supreme Court of Justice has the power to declare laws and government actions unconstitutional.

Guatemala is a **unitary state**, meaning that the central government has the majority of the power and the departments and municipalities have limited autonomy. The country is divided into 22 departments, each of which has its own governor and municipal governments. However, the departments and municipalities have limited powers and rely heavily on the central government for funding and support.
