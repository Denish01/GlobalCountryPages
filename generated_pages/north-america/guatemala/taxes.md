[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Guatemala has a **territorial tax system**, which means that individuals and companies are taxed only on income earned within the country, except for certain cases where foreign income is subject to taxation. Residency rules for tax purposes in Guatemala are based on the individual's physical presence in the country for more than 183 days in a calendar year, or having a permanent home in Guatemala. This implies that individuals who meet these conditions are considered tax residents and are subject to taxation on their worldwide income.

The tax system in Guatemala is administered by the **Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria (SAT)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services. The SAT also provides guidance and support to taxpayers to help them comply with their tax obligations. Guatemala has a relatively complex tax system, with various tax rates and exemptions, and it is essential for individuals and businesses to understand their tax obligations to avoid penalties and fines.
