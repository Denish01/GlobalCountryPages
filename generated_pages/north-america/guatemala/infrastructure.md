# Guatemala Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Guatemala is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 85% of population
Internet Penetration: 35%
Road Network: 14,095 km, with 40% paved
Rail Network: 885 km
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 3, including Santo Tomás de Castilla and Puerto Quetzal
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Guatemala's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with significant gaps between urban and rural areas. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's roads, energy generation, and telecommunications networks. However, much work remains to be done to address the country's infrastructure deficits, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation is often limited. The government has launched several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a new national infrastructure plan and the creation of a public-private partnership framework to attract private sector investment.

Despite these efforts, Guatemala's infrastructure remains a major constraint to economic growth and development. The country's infrastructure is often inadequate, unreliable, and inefficient, which can increase the cost of doing business and reduce the country's competitiveness. Furthermore, the lack of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation in rural areas can have significant negative impacts on the health, education, and well-being of rural communities. To address these challenges, the government will need to continue to invest in infrastructure development, with a focus on improving access to basic services in rural areas and promoting more efficient and sustainable use of resources.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge in Guatemala. In urban areas, such as Guatemala City, infrastructure is generally more developed, with access to modern amenities such as electricity, water, and sanitation. However, in rural areas, infrastructure is often limited, with many communities lacking access to basic services. This can make it difficult for rural communities to access markets, education, and healthcare, which can perpetuate poverty and inequality. To address this challenge, the government will need to prioritize investments in rural infrastructure, including the development of roads, energy generation, and telecommunications networks.
