However, the urban-rural divide is still pronounced, with rural areas often experiencing slower speeds and less reliable connections. In urban areas, internet services are generally stable, with most providers offering a range of plans to suit different needs and budgets. Nevertheless, power outages and maintenance can still cause service disruptions, especially during the rainy season.\n\nDespite these challenges, Guatemala's internet infrastructure has been expanding, with many providers investing in fiber-optic networks and 4G coverage. This has enabled more people to access the internet, particularly in urban areas, where the majority of the population is concentrated. As a result, tourists and digital nomads can generally expect to find reliable internet connections in major cities and tourist destinations, although it's always a good idea to research specific locations and providers before arriving.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Guatemala, visitors can purchase one from a local provider such as Claro, Tigo, or Movistar. These carriers have stores and authorized retailers throughout the country, including at airports and major tourist destinations. To buy a SIM card, you'll typically need to provide a valid passport and pay a small fee, usually around 10 USD. Claro and Tigo are popular options among tourists, offering a range of prepaid plans with data, voice, and text services. Movistar is another major carrier with a strong presence in Guatemala, although its plans and pricing may vary.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Claro | Tourist Plan | 1GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Tigo | Prepaid Plan | 2GB | 15 | Valid for 15 days |\n| Movistar | Visitor Plan | 500MB | 8 | Valid for 5 days |\n| Claro | Monthly Plan | 5GB | 30 | Auto-renews unless canceled |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many establishments offering free or low-cost internet access to guests.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is growing in popularity, especially in tourist areas, with many coffee shops and restaurants providing free WiFi to customers.\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more common in major cities, offering reliable and fast internet connections, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and printing services.\n- Public WiFi is available in some areas, such as parks and plazas, although the quality and security of these connections can vary.\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi, although the speed and reliability can be inconsistent.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Impact Hub and WeWork offer reliable and fast internet connections, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and networking events.\n- Cafe chains like Starbucks and Cafe Condesa have multiple locations and generally offer good WiFi, making them popular spots for remote workers.\n- Backup internet options like portable Wi-Fi hotspots or mobile tethering can be useful in case of power outages or service disruptions.\n- Using a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** can help ensure secure and private internet connections, especially when working with sensitive data.\n- Some hotels and resorts also offer **co-working facilities** and meeting rooms, catering to the growing number of digital nomads and remote workers.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is generally not a concern in Guatemala, although some websites may be blocked due to copyright or other issues.\n- Using a VPN can help bypass any blocked sites and ensure secure internet connections.\n- Roaming alternatives like eSIMs or portable Wi-Fi hotspots can be more cost-effective than traditional roaming plans.\n- It's essential to research and choose a reputable provider to avoid **internet scams** or **data theft**.\n- Regularly updating **antivirus software** and using strong passwords can also help protect against **cyber threats**.\n- When using public WiFi, it's a good idea to use a VPN and avoid accessing sensitive information to minimize the risk of **data breaches**.",
