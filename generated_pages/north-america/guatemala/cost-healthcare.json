  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Guatemala can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often overcrowded and underfunded, while private healthcare offers higher quality care at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $392 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 57.2% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 125\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: GTQ\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGuatemala's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, with limited resources and long wait times, but it is often the only option for low-income Guatemalans. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality care and shorter wait times, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers more familiar standards of care and is often staffed by English-speaking medical professionals. However, it is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare.\n\nThe healthcare system in Guatemala is divided into three main sectors: the public sector, which includes hospitals and clinics run by the Ministry of Health; the private sector, which includes private hospitals and clinics; and the social security sector, which includes hospitals and clinics run by the Guatemalan Social Security Institute. While the public sector is generally underfunded, the private sector is well-equipped and offers high-quality care, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, but for foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred choice due to its higher quality and shorter wait times.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may require a referral |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dentists may offer more advanced services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may offer more comprehensive exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals may have long wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Private hospitals may offer more advanced surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$2,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive maternity care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more advanced imaging services |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Private hospitals may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public healthcare services, limited private services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private healthcare services, including hospital stays and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, including international evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are widely available in Guatemala, but may require a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Over-the-counter medications are also widely available, but may not be as comprehensive as in other countries\n- Common medications like **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** are generally affordable, with prices ranging from $5-$20\n- More specialized medications like **insulin** and **asthma inhalers** may be more expensive, with prices ranging from $20-$50\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration dates and packaging of medications before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 125, or to seek out the nearest hospital or clinic. Private hospitals and clinics often have their own emergency services, including ambulances and emergency rooms. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek out private hospitals and clinics, as they often offer higher quality care and more familiar standards of treatment. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Guatemala include the **Hospital Herrera Llerandi** and the **Centro Medico**, both of which are located in Guatemala City and offer a range of medical services, including emergency care and surgeries.\n\nIn the event of a serious medical emergency, it may be necessary to evacuate to a nearby country or to the United States for treatment. This can be a complex and expensive process, and it is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance that covers international evacuations and repatriations. It is also recommended to research the local healthcare system and to have a plan in place in the event of a medical emergency, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital or clinic and having a means of communication, such as a **cell phone** or a **two-way radio**.",
