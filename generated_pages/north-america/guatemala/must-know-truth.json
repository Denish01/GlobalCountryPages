  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nGuatemala, a sovereign country located in North America, has a rich and complex history. The territory that is now Guatemala was first inhabited by the **Maya civilization** around 2000 BCE. The Maya developed a sophisticated culture, with advanced knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, and architecture. In 1524, the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado arrived in Guatemala, marking the beginning of the **Spanish colonization** period. The Spanish established the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which included the territories of present-day Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.\n\nGuatemala declared its independence from Spain on September 15, 1821, along with the other Central American provinces.
