[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Guatemala's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being generally underfunded and overstretched. The **Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance** is responsible for overseeing the public healthcare system, which includes a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, many of these facilities, especially in rural areas, often lack basic medical supplies, equipment, and trained personnel. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics, particularly those in urban areas like Guatemala City, offer higher quality care and better facilities, but at a significantly higher cost.

The quality of care in Guatemala varies greatly depending on the location and type of facility. Urban areas tend to have better-equipped hospitals and more specialized care, while rural areas often rely on basic health clinics with limited resources. This disparity in access to quality healthcare is a significant challenge for the country, particularly for the poor and marginalized populations who cannot afford private healthcare.

Despite these challenges, Guatemala has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, including increasing access to healthcare services, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women. The country has also implemented various health programs and initiatives aimed at reducing maternal and infant mortality, improving nutrition, and controlling infectious diseases.
