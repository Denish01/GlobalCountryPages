[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Guatemala is a country with diverse climate zones, ranging from tropical to temperate, depending on the region. The dry season, which lasts from December to April, is characterized by mild temperatures, low humidity, and minimal rainfall. This period is ideal for traveling, as it allows for comfortable exploration of the country's outdoor attractions, such as volcanoes, lakes, and beaches. In contrast, the wet season, which spans from May to November, is marked by heavy rainfall, potential hurricanes, and higher temperatures, making it less desirable for travel. The country's highlands, including the western highlands and the Guatemalan Highlands, tend to be cooler and more temperate, while the coastal regions and low-lying areas are generally warmer and more humid.

The seasons in Guatemala have a significant impact on travel, as they can affect the accessibility of certain areas, the availability of accommodations, and the overall travel experience. During the dry season, popular destinations like Antigua, Lake Atitlán, and the Pacaya volcano tend to be more crowded, while the wet season can lead to road closures and limited access to remote areas. Additionally, the country's many festivals and celebrations, such as the Semana Santa (Holy Week) and the Fiestas de la Vendimia (Grape Harvest Festival), often coincide with the dry season, making it a great time to experience Guatemala's rich cultural heritage.

Guatemala's climate zones also vary by region, with the Petén region in the north being generally hotter and more humid, while the highlands are cooler and more temperate. The coastal regions, including the Pacific coast and the Caribbean coast, tend to be warmer and more humid, with a greater risk of hurricanes and tropical storms during the wet season. Understanding these regional variations is essential for planning a trip to Guatemala, as it can help travelers make informed decisions about when and where to go.
