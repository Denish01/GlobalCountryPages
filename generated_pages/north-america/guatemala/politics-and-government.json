The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is elected by popular vote for a four-year term and is limited to two terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral Congress of the Republic, made up of 160 members who are also elected by popular vote for four-year terms. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court of Justice, which is composed of 13 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Congress.\n\nThe separation of powers in Guatemala is designed to provide checks and balances on each branch of government. The President has the power to appoint ministers and other high-ranking officials, but the Congress has the power to approve or reject these appointments. The Congress also has the power to impeach the President and other high-ranking officials. The Supreme Court of Justice has the power to declare laws and government actions unconstitutional.\n\nGuatemala is a **unitary state**, meaning that the central government has the majority of the power and the departments and municipalities have limited autonomy. The country is divided into 22 departments, each of which has its own governor and municipal governments. However, the departments and municipalities have limited powers and rely heavily on the central government for funding and support.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Alejandro Giammattei | Head of state and head of government |\n| Legislative | Congress of the Republic | President of the Congress | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Justice | President of the Supreme Court | Judicial review and interpretation of laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vamos por una Guatemala Diferente | Center-right | Alejandro Giammattei | 17 | Won the 2019 presidential election |\n| National Unity of Hope | Center-left | Sandra Torres | 52 | Largest party in the Congress |\n| National Convergence Front | Center-right | Jimmy Morales | 8 | Former ruling party |\n| Lider | Center-right | Manuel Baldizón | 10 | Founded by the former presidential candidate |\n| Winaq | Left-wing | Amilcar de Jesús Pop Ac | 4 | Indigenous rights party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Guatemala is based on a **direct popular vote**, where voters elect the President, members of the Congress, and mayors.\n- Elections are held every four years, with the most recent presidential election taking place in 2019.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled to take place in 2023.\n- Voter participation in Guatemala has been relatively low, with only about 40% of eligible voters participating in the 2019 presidential election.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Guatemala is **volatile**, with high levels of corruption, crime, and poverty.\n- Key issues facing the country include **gang violence**, **corruption**, and **poverty**, which have contributed to high levels of migration to the United States.\n- Regional dynamics, including the **Central American migrant crisis**, have also had a significant impact on Guatemala's politics and economy.\n- Guatemala has been ranked as \"partly free\" by the Freedom House organization, with significant concerns about **human rights** and **press freedom**.\n- The country has also been ranked as one of the most **corrupt countries** in the world, according to Transparency International.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Guatemala is a member of the **United Nations**, the **Organization of American States**, and the **Central American Integration System**.\n- The country has a **strategic partnership** with the United States, which provides significant economic and military aid.\n- Guatemala has also been a key player in regional efforts to address the **Central American migrant crisis**, including the **Alliance for Prosperity**.\n- The country has a **border dispute** with Belize, which has been a source of tension between the two countries.\n- Guatemala has also been a member of the **International Criminal Court**, which has been a point of contention with the United States.",
