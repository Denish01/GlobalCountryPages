[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Guatemala is divided into public and private institutions, with a significant difference in quality between the two. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but often lack resources and have large class sizes, resulting in a lower quality of education. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significant cost. The language of instruction is Spanish, but some private schools may offer bilingual or English-only programs. Compulsory education in Guatemala lasts for 9 years, from age 7 to 15. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including American, British, and International Baccalaureate.

The quality of education in Guatemala is a concern, with many public schools facing challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of resources, and insufficient teacher training. However, there are also many excellent private schools and international institutions that offer a high-quality education, often with a focus on bilingual or multilingual programs. Expats and international students may find that these schools offer a more familiar and rigorous academic environment. Additionally, some schools may offer specialized programs, such as **STEM** education or **arts** programs, which can be a great option for students with specific interests.
