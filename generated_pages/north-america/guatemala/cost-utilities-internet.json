However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The costs of utilities in Guatemala are generally stable, but can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the dry season (December to May) due to increased demand for air conditioning.\n\nThe Guatemalan government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and investments in renewable energy sources. However, the country still relies heavily on fossil fuels, which can contribute to price volatility. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the provider, with some companies offering more competitive rates than others. It's essential to research and compare prices before choosing a utility provider in Guatemala.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in water bill in some areas) |\n| **Total** | **$75** | **$120** | **$175** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-30 Mbps | Claro, Tigo |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 60-100 Mbps | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-20 GB | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Claro, Tigo, Movistar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (Guatemalan streaming services like Guatevision) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Guatemala, it's recommended to visit the provider's office in person, as online services may not be available.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for those who want to control their energy usage and avoid surprise bills.\n- Claro and Tigo are two of the most popular internet providers in Guatemala, offering a range of plans and competitive prices.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts.",
