Guatemala and Honduras are two neighboring countries in Central America, sharing similar cultural and historical backgrounds, but with distinct economic profiles. Guatemala has a more diverse economy, with a stronger focus on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, which contributes to its relatively higher GDP per capita.

Guatemala has a more stable economy, with a lower inflation rate and a more diversified industrial base. Honduras, however, has faced more economic challenges, including higher inflation and a greater dependence on foreign aid.
