Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month deposit required, which is refundable at the end of the lease. Tenant rights are protected under French law, as Saint Barthelemy is an overseas collectivity of France. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Saint Martin and Anguilla, Saint Barthelemy's housing costs are among the highest in the Caribbean.\n\nThe high demand for housing in Saint Barthelemy, particularly from tourists and expats, has driven up prices in recent years. However, the island's small size and limited availability of land mean that the housing market is subject to fluctuations in supply and demand. As a result, renters and buyers should be prepared to act quickly when they find a suitable property, and to negotiate prices carefully. The local government has implemented measures to control the rental market and protect tenants, but the market remains highly competitive.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$1,800 | small, basic apartments |\n| 1 Bedroom | $2,000-$3,000 | $1,500-$2,500 | compact, modern apartments |\n| 2 Bedroom | $3,000-$5,000 | $2,000-$3,500 | family-size apartments with amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $4,500-$7,000 | $3,000-$5,000 | spacious, luxury apartments |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $5,000-$10,000 | prime locations, luxury properties |\n| Suburbs | $3,000-$6,000 | residential areas, modern homes |\n| Rural | $2,000-$4,000 | countryside, traditional homes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Gustavia**: the capital city, with a range of apartments and houses available, from $2,000 to $5,000 per month\n- **Saint-Jean**: a popular area for expats, with a mix of modern and traditional homes, from $1,500 to $3,500 per month\n- **Colombier**: a quiet, residential area with a range of apartments and houses, from $1,200 to $2,500 per month\n- **Corossol**: a charming, traditional neighborhood with a range of houses and apartments, from $1,000 to $2,000 per month\n- **Lorient**: a family-friendly area with a range of modern homes and apartments, from $1,500 to $3,000 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Saint Barthelemy [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to find the best deals and avoid overpaying\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Be prepared to act quickly when you find a suitable property, as the market is highly competitive\n- Negotiate the price carefully, and consider factors such as the length of the lease and the condition of the property\n- Check what utilities are included in the rent, as this can vary from property to property\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment, as this can be more convenient and cost-effective than buying furniture and appliances\n- Be aware of scams and frauds, and never pay a deposit without seeing the property and signing a lease agreement",
