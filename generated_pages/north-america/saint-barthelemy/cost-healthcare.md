The healthcare system in Saint Barthelemy is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of medical services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the public system can be slow and bureaucratic, and may not offer the same level of comfort and amenities as private facilities. For locals, the public system is often the preferred choice, as it is generally more affordable and widely accessible. For foreigners, private healthcare providers may be a better option, as they often offer more comprehensive services and may have staff who speak English and other languages.

This means that medical facilities and professionals in Saint Barthelemy must meet strict quality and safety standards, ensuring that patients receive high-quality care. However, the system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for foreigners who may not speak French. It is recommended that visitors and expats purchase health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare in Saint Barthelemy can be high, especially for private services.
