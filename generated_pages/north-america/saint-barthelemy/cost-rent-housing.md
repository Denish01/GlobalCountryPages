[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Saint Barthelemy is highly competitive, with a limited supply of available apartments and houses, particularly in the city center of Gustavia. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month deposit required, which is refundable at the end of the lease. Tenant rights are protected under French law, as Saint Barthelemy is an overseas collectivity of France. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Saint Martin and Anguilla, Saint Barthelemy's housing costs are among the highest in the Caribbean.

The high demand for housing in Saint Barthelemy, particularly from tourists and expats, has driven up prices in recent years. However, the island's small size and limited availability of land mean that the housing market is subject to fluctuations in supply and demand. As a result, renters and buyers should be prepared to act quickly when they find a suitable property, and to negotiate prices carefully. The local government has implemented measures to control the rental market and protect tenants, but the market remains highly competitive.
