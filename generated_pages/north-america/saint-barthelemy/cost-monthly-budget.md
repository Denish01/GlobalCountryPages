[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Barthelemy is a small island territory in the Caribbean with a high cost of living, driven by its remote location and limited resources. The GDP per capita (PPP) of $38,994 indicates a relatively high standard of living, but also means that prices for goods and services are accordingly elevated. A budget of $2,500 per month would allow for a basic lifestyle, with some compromises on accommodation, food, and entertainment. In contrast, a mid-range budget of $4,000 per month would provide a more comfortable lifestyle, with the ability to afford a one-bedroom apartment in the center of Gustavia, eat out occasionally, and enjoy some leisure activities. A comfortable lifestyle, with a budget of $6,000 per month, would offer a high level of luxury, with a spacious apartment, frequent dining out, and regular use of taxis or a private car.

The cost of living in Saint Barthelemy is comparable to other Caribbean islands, such as Saint Martin and Anguilla, but is generally higher due to its exclusive and upscale reputation. However, compared to other French territories in the region, such as Guadeloupe and Martinique, Saint Barthelemy is significantly more expensive. This is due to its small size, lack of local industry, and reliance on imports, which drive up prices for goods and services.
