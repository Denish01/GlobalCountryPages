[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Saint Barthelemy is based on the French model, with a strong emphasis on public healthcare and social security. The system is generally well-funded and well-organized, with a high standard of care. However, some specialized treatments may not be available on the island, and patients may need to be evacuated to larger centers in France or other countries. The island has a relatively small population, and as a result, the healthcare system is relatively small, with a limited number of hospitals and medical facilities. Despite this, the quality of care is generally high, and medical staff are well-trained and experienced.

The healthcare system in Saint Barthelemy is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector providing the majority of healthcare services. The public sector is funded through social security contributions and government funding, and provides a wide range of services, including hospital care, outpatient care, and preventive care. The private sector is smaller, but provides a range of specialized services, including dental care, optical care, and cosmetic surgery. In general, the quality of care in both the public and private sectors is high, although some patients may prefer to use private facilities for certain treatments.

Urban areas, such as Gustavia, have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where services may be more limited. However, the island is small, and even in rural areas, medical facilities are generally within reach. The healthcare system is also well-equipped to deal with emergencies, with a well-organized emergency response system and access to air ambulance services for medical evacuations.
