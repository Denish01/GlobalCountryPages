However, the costs can fluctuate due to seasonal variations in demand, especially during the peak tourist season from December to April. The electricity cost is relatively high compared to other countries, and the water supply is mostly desalinated, which contributes to the higher costs. The French utility company, EDF, provides electricity to the island, while the local government manages the water and garbage services.\n\nThe utility costs in Saint Barthelemy are generally stable, but the prices can increase during the peak season due to the high demand. It is essential to note that the costs can vary depending on the location, size of the apartment, and usage patterns. The island's remote location and limited resources also contribute to the higher costs of utilities and internet services. To manage the costs, residents and visitors can take advantage of the prepaid electricity options and choose from various internet service providers that offer competitive rates.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | Not applicable |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $20 | $30 | $40 | Included in municipal taxes |\n| **Total** | **$130** | **$200** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 10-20 Mbps | Orange, SFR |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-100 | 60-100 Mbps | Orange, SFR |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $20-30 | 5-10 GB | Digicel, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-50 | 10-20 GB | Digicel, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-120 | varies | Orange, SFR |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Saint Barthelemy, residents and visitors can contact the local utility companies, such as EDF for electricity and the municipal government for water and garbage services.\n- Prepaid electricity options are available, which can help manage costs and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Saint Barthelemy are Orange and SFR, which offer competitive rates and reliable services.\n- To save on utility bills, residents and visitors can take advantage of energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible.\n- It is essential to research and compare the different service providers and plans to find the best option for your needs and budget.",
