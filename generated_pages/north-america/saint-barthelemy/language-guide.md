While English is not an official language, it is still widely understood, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. Visitors can expect to encounter some English speakers, especially in restaurants, shops, and hotels, but it is still a good idea to learn some basic French phrases to enhance their experience.

The regional dialects of French spoken in Saint Barthelemy have been influenced by the island's history and cultural exchanges with other Caribbean islands. The dialect is characterized by a unique accent and vocabulary, which may be different from the standard French spoken in France. Despite these differences, standard French is still widely understood and used in formal situations, such as government offices, schools, and official events.

Minority languages, such as Portuguese and Spanish, are also spoken by some members of the community, particularly those who have immigrated to the island from other countries.
