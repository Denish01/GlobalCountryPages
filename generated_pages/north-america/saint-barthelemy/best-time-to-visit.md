[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Saint Barthelemy, a French territory in the Caribbean, has a tropical climate with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity, plenty of sunshine, and gentle breezes. This period is ideal for outdoor activities such as sailing, snorkeling, and hiking. The wet season, which spans from May to November, is marked by higher humidity, occasional rain showers, and a greater risk of hurricanes and tropical storms. The island's geography, with its rugged terrain and coastal areas, can be affected by these weather conditions, making some regions more prone to flooding and landslides during the wet season.

The dry season is the best time to visit Saint Barthelemy, as the weather is pleasant and dry, making it ideal for outdoor activities and water sports. The peak season, which runs from December to February, is the busiest time of the year, with many tourists visiting the island to escape the cold winter months in North America and Europe. During this period, prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher, and the island's popular beaches and restaurants can be quite crowded.

The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, and many tourist facilities and businesses may be closed or operate on reduced hours. However, this period can be a good time to visit for those on a budget, as prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be lower. Additionally, the wet season can be a good time to see the island's lush vegetation and green landscapes, which are nourished by the rainfall.
