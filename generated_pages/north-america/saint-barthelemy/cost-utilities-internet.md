[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Saint Barthelemy is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and garbage collection. However, the costs can fluctuate due to seasonal variations in demand, especially during the peak tourist season from December to April. The electricity cost is relatively high compared to other countries, and the water supply is mostly desalinated, which contributes to the higher costs. The French utility company, EDF, provides electricity to the island, while the local government manages the water and garbage services.

The utility costs in Saint Barthelemy are generally stable, but the prices can increase during the peak season due to the high demand. It is essential to note that the costs can vary depending on the location, size of the apartment, and usage patterns.
