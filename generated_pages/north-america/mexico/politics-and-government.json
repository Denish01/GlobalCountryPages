The Constitution establishes the principles of **democracy**, **federalism**, and **separation of powers**, and guarantees the rights and freedoms of Mexican citizens.\n\nThe political system in Mexico is characterized by a **multi-party system**, with several major parties competing for power. The main parties are the **Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)**, the **National Action Party (PAN)**, and the **Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD)**. These parties have different ideologies and platforms, but they all operate within the framework of the Constitution and the democratic system.
