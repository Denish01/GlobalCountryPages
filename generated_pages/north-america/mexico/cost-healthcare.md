[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Mexico has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private services. The public healthcare system, known as the **Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)**, provides affordable healthcare to Mexican citizens and permanent residents, while private healthcare services are available for those who can afford them. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary choice, while foreigners and expats may prefer private healthcare services due to language barriers and higher quality of care. It is recommended to have health insurance in Mexico, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover unexpected medical expenses and provide access to better healthcare services.

The Mexican healthcare system can be complex, and navigating it can be challenging, especially for foreigners. However, many private hospitals and clinics cater to international patients and offer high-quality care. Some popular private hospitals in Mexico include the **Hospital Ángeles** and the **Star Médica**. These hospitals often have English-speaking staff and offer a range of medical services, including specialized treatments and emergency care. Additionally, some private hospitals have international accreditation, such as the **Joint Commission International (JCI)**, which ensures that they meet high standards of quality and safety.
