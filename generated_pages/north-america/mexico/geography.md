[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Mexico is a **sovereign** country located in **North America**, bordered by the United States to the north, Guatemala and Belize to the southeast, and the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. The country's strategic location makes it a gateway between the two American continents, with a long history of cultural exchange and trade. Mexico's borders stretch for over 3,200 kilometers with the United States, making it one of the longest international borders in the world.

Mexico's geography is also characterized by its extensive coastline, with the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. The country's coastline is marked by several important ports, including the Port of Veracruz and the Port of Manzanillo, which are key hubs for international trade. The Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, separates the Baja California Peninsula from the rest of Mexico, while the Yucatan Peninsula juts out into the Gulf of Mexico. The country's unique geography has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Mexico's terrain is incredibly diverse, with a range of ecosystems that support a wide variety of flora and fauna. The country's landscape is dominated by the **Sierra Madre** mountain ranges, which stretch from the US-Mexico border in the north to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the south. The Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental mountain ranges meet in the center of the country, forming the **Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt**, a region of high volcanic activity. The highest peak in Mexico, **Pico de Orizaba**, is located in this region and is a popular destination for hikers and climbers.

Mexico's terrain also includes several large deserts, including the **Chihuahuan Desert**, which covers much of the northern part of the country, and the **Sonoran Desert**, which covers parts of the northwest. The country's coastal regions are generally low-lying and flat, with many beaches, lagoons, and mangrove swamps. The **Yucatan Peninsula**, which is composed of limestone, is a unique region with many **cenotes** (natural sinkholes) and **caves**. Mexico's diverse terrain has created a wide range of ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to arid deserts, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges.

The country's rivers, including the **Rio Grande**, which forms part of the US-Mexico border, and the **Usumacinta River**, which flows through the southeastern part of the country, play a crucial role in shaping the landscape and supporting agriculture and industry. Mexico's terrain has also been shaped by its volcanic history, with many **volcanic lakes** and **hot springs** throughout the country.
