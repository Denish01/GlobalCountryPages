[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, Mexico offers a mix of supermarkets and local markets, each with its own advantages. Supermarkets like Walmart and Soriana offer a wide range of products, including imported goods, at fixed prices. On the other hand, local markets like Mercado de San Juan or Mercado de La Merced offer fresh produce, meats, and dairy products at competitive prices, with the added benefit of being able to **haggle** over prices. In general, local markets tend to be cheaper than supermarkets, particularly for fresh produce and meats.

However, supermarkets often have a wider selection of products, including imported goods, and may offer more convenient shopping hours and payment options. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to be aware of the **bargaining norms**, which can vary depending on the vendor and the product. In general, it's a good idea to start with a lower offer and be prepared to negotiate. Additionally, some vendors may offer discounts for bulk purchases or for paying in cash. By understanding the differences between supermarkets and local markets, shoppers can make informed decisions about where to buy their groceries and get the best value for their money.
