[SECTION] How Mexico Is Divided [/SECTION]
Mexico is a federal republic divided into 32 states, each with its own capital and government. The states are further divided into municipalities, which are the second-level administrative divisions. This structure allows for a balance of power between the federal government and the individual states, giving each region a degree of autonomy to manage its own affairs. The country's administrative divisions are designed to provide effective governance and representation for its diverse population.

The 32 states in Mexico are grouped into several regions, each with its unique cultural, economic, and geographical characteristics. These regions are not strictly defined, but they are generally recognized as the North, the Pacific Coast, the Yucatan Peninsula, the Central Highlands, and the Gulf Coast. Each region has its own distinct identity, shaped by its history, climate, and geography. Understanding these regional differences is essential to appreciating the complexity and diversity of Mexico as a whole.

The country's bus system is extensive and affordable, with many companies offering comfortable and convenient services. Driving is also a popular option, with many scenic routes and well-maintained highways. However, traffic in major cities can be chaotic, and driving at night is not recommended.
