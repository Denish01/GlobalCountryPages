[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
Mexico's internet infrastructure has improved significantly in recent years, with a growing number of internet service providers and a increasing coverage of mobile networks. However, there is still a significant urban-rural divide, with internet speeds and availability being generally better in cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey, than in rural areas. The reliability of the internet can also be a issue, with outages and slow speeds being common, especially during peak hours.

In general, the internet quality in Mexico is good enough for most users, with average speeds of around 25 Mbps download, which is sufficient for streaming, browsing, and online work. However, the quality of the internet can vary depending on the location and the provider, so it's a good idea to research and compare different options before choosing an internet service provider. Additionally, the Mexican government has implemented initiatives to improve the country's digital infrastructure, including the deployment of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks.
