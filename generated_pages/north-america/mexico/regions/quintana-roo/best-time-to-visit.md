[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Quintana Roo, located on the Caribbean coast of Mexico, has a tropical climate with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit the region. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by high humidity and frequent rainfall, with the most significant amount of rain falling in September and October. The region's climate is also influenced by its geographical location, with the coastal areas tend to be cooler than the inland areas.

The dry season is the peak tourist season in Quintana Roo, with millions of visitors flocking to the region's beautiful beaches, ancient Mayan ruins, and vibrant cities. The weather is perfect for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and hiking, and the region's many festivals and events take place during this time. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices for accommodations and tourist services. However, the rain can make some outdoor activities difficult, and some tourist attractions may be closed due to the weather.

The region's climate and seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit for most tourists. However, for those looking for a more budget-friendly option, the shoulder season (May to June and September to November) can be a good alternative. During this time, the weather is still pleasant, and the prices for accommodations and tourist services are lower than during the peak season.
