The region shares a border with the Mexican states of Yucatan and Campeche to the west, and Belize to the south.

Booking in advance is usually the best way to get the cheapest fares, and you can expect to pay around $100-$200 USD for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nQuintana Roo does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option in the region.
