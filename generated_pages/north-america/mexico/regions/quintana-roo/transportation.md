[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Quintana Roo is easily accessible by air, with Cancun International Airport (CUN) being the main entry point for most visitors. The airport is a major hub with direct flights from many cities in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Some of the major airlines that operate direct flights to Cancun include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Aeromexico. If you're traveling from other parts of Mexico, you can also fly into Cozumel International Airport (CZM) or Chetumal International Airport (CTM), although options may be more limited.

In addition to flying, you can also enter Quintana Roo by land or sea. The region shares a border with the Mexican states of Yucatan and Campeche to the west, and Belize to the south. There are several overland entry points, including the border crossings at Subteniente Lopez and La Union, where you can cross from Belize into Mexico. You can also take a ferry from Belize or other nearby islands to reach the coastal towns of Quintana Roo.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Quintana Roo has an extensive domestic air network, with flights connecting the region to other parts of Mexico. Some of the main domestic airlines that operate in the region include Aeromexico, Interjet, and VivaAerobus. You can fly from Cancun to other major cities in Mexico, such as Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey, as well as to smaller towns and tourist destinations like Tulum and Cozumel. Booking in advance is usually the best way to get the cheapest fares, and you can expect to pay around $100-$200 USD for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
