[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Yucatan region is easily accessible by air, with two main international airports: Cancun International Airport (CUN) and Merida International Airport (MID). Cancun Airport is a major hub with direct flights from many cities in the United States, Canada, and Europe, while Merida Airport receives flights from major Mexican cities and some international destinations. You can also enter the region overland from neighboring states, such as Quintana Roo or Campeche, by bus or car. The main border crossings are located on the highways that connect Yucatan to these states, and they are generally open 24 hours a day.

If you prefer to travel by land, you can take a bus from major cities in Mexico, such as Mexico City or Guadalajara, to Merida or Cancun. Several bus companies, including ADO and Oriente, operate daily services to Yucatan, with fares starting from around 500 MXN (25 USD) for a one-way ticket. Alternatively, you can drive to Yucatan from other parts of Mexico, using the country's extensive network of highways. The journey from Mexico City to Merida, for example, takes around 20 hours by car, depending on traffic and road conditions.
