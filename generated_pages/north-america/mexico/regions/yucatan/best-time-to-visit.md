[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Yucatan is a region in southeastern Mexico, known for its rich Mayan heritage and diverse natural beauty. The region has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is hotter and more humid, with occasional heavy rainfall and a higher risk of hurricanes. The region's climate is divided into three main zones: the coastal area, which is generally cooler and more humid; the interior, which is hotter and drier; and the jungle, which is the hottest and most humid. Understanding these climate zones and seasons is essential to planning a successful trip to Yucatan.

The dry season is the best time to visit Yucatan, as the weather is pleasant and there are fewer crowds. This is also the peak season, with many tourists visiting the region to enjoy the beaches, archaeological sites, and colonial towns. The wet season, on the other hand, is less popular with tourists, but it can still be a good time to visit, as prices are lower and there are fewer crowds. However, the hot and humid weather, as well as the risk of hurricanes, can make it less comfortable for some travelers.

The seasons in Yucatan also affect the types of activities and experiences available. During the dry season, it is possible to visit the region's many archaeological sites, such as Chichen Itza and Tulum, without the crowds and heat. The beaches, such as those in Cancun and Playa del Carmen, are also more pleasant during this time. During the wet season, it is still possible to visit these sites, but it may be more uncomfortable due to the heat and humidity. However, the wet season is a good time to see the region's natural beauty, such as the waterfalls and cenotes, which are more full and lush during this time.
