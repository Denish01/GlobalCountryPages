[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The Yucatan region is characterized by a flat, low-lying terrain, with an average elevation of only about 30 meters above sea level. The landscape is dotted with numerous **cenotes**, which are sinkholes that have formed when the limestone bedrock has collapsed, revealing underground waterways. These cenotes are not only an important source of fresh water but also a popular destination for tourists, who come to swim and snorkel in their crystal-clear waters. The region's terrain is also marked by a network of dry riverbeds, known as **bajos**, which are prone to flooding during the rainy season.

The Yucatan region is home to a diverse range of ecosystems, including tropical forests, savannas, and coastal wetlands. The **tropical forests** of the Yucatan are characterized by a dense canopy of trees, including species such as **mahogany** and **cedar**. These forests are home to a wide range of wildlife, including **jaguars**, **pumas**, and **quetzals**. The **savannas** of the Yucatan are grasslands with scattered trees, and are home to a range of wildlife, including **deer**, **peccaries**, and **birds of prey**. The **coastal wetlands** of the Yucatan are an important habitat for a range of marine species, including **sea turtles**, **manatees**, and **fish**.

The Yucatan region's terrain and landscape have played a significant role in shaping its history and culture. The **Maya civilization**, which once thrived in this area, built numerous cities and temples, including the famous **Chichen Itza** and **Uxmal**. These cities were built on the flat terrain of the Yucatan, and feature a range of architectural styles, including **pyramids**, **temples**, and **palaces**.
