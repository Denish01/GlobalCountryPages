[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Mexico City's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being generally more affordable but often overcrowded and underfunded. The private system, on the other hand, offers higher quality care but at a significantly higher cost. The quality of care in Mexico City is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics having modern equipment and well-trained staff. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, and the public system often struggles with long waiting times and limited resources. Overall, Mexico City's healthcare system is well-equipped to handle a range of medical needs, from routine check-ups to complex surgeries.

The public healthcare system in Mexico City is overseen by the Ministry of Health, and it provides a range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and medications, to Mexican citizens and foreigners with a valid visa. The private system, on the other hand, is made up of a network of private hospitals and clinics that offer a range of services, from basic medical care to specialized treatments. Many private hospitals and clinics in Mexico City have international accreditation and offer high-quality care, making them a popular choice for expats and medical tourists.

One of the main challenges facing Mexico City's healthcare system is the issue of accessibility, particularly in rural areas. Many rural communities lack access to basic medical care, and patients often have to travel long distances to receive treatment. To address this issue, the government has implemented a number of programs aimed at improving access to healthcare in rural areas, including the deployment of mobile health units and the establishment of community health centers.
