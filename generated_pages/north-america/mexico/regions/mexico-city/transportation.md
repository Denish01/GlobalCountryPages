[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Mexico City is a major transportation hub, and the best way to get there is by flying into Benito Juárez International Airport, which is located about 6 miles east of the city center. The airport is a major hub for several airlines, including Aeromexico, Interjet, and Volaris, and offers direct flights to many destinations in the United States, Canada, Central and South America, Europe, and Asia. Alternatively, you can also take a bus or drive to Mexico City from other parts of Mexico or from the US-Mexico border.

If you're coming from within Mexico, you can take a bus or drive to Mexico City from other major cities like Guadalajara, Monterrey, or Puebla. The city is also connected to the US-Mexico border by several highways, including Highway 57 and Highway 45, which make it easy to drive to Mexico City from cities like El Paso, Texas, or Tucson, Arizona. Additionally, there are several bus companies that offer cross-border bus services from the US to Mexico City, including Greyhound and Turimex.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Mexico has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights to many destinations throughout the country. The main domestic airlines in Mexico are Aeromexico, Interjet, and Volaris, which offer flights to most major cities, including Cancun, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agency, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way ticket from Mexico City to Cancun, for example, can cost anywhere from $100 to $300 USD, depending on the airline and time of booking.

It's a good idea to book domestic flights in advance, especially during peak travel seasons like summer and holidays. You can also use online travel agencies like Expedia or Kayak to compare prices and find the best deals. Additionally, some airlines offer discounts or promotions for students, seniors, or military personnel, so it's worth checking the airline's website for any available discounts.

Mexico's rail network is limited, with only a few passenger train routes available. The most notable train route is the **Tequila Express**, which runs from Guadalajara to Tequila, and offers a scenic ride through the countryside. There are also a few commuter train routes in Mexico City, including the **Tren Suburbano**, which connects the city center to the surrounding suburbs. However, for most domestic travel, buses or flights are a more convenient and efficient option.

If you do want to take the train, you can book tickets online or at the train station. The train network is operated by **Ferromex**, which offers passenger services on several routes, including the **Tequila Express**. However, the train network is not as extensive as in other countries, and buses or flights are often a better option for long-distance travel.
