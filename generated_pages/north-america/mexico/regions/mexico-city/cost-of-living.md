- Take advantage of free or low-cost cultural events and activities, such as visiting museums on Sundays or attending outdoor concerts.
- Learn some basic Spanish phrases, such as "¿Cuánto cuesta?" (how much does it cost?), to help you navigate and negotiate prices.
- Avoid exchanging money at airports or tourist areas, where rates are often unfavorable, and instead use ATMs or currency exchange offices.
