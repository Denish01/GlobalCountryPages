The metro is one of the most extensive in the world, with 12 lines and over 150 stations. Buses cover most areas of the city, including the surrounding municipalities. Taxis and ride-hailing services are also widely available. For longer distances, domestic flights and buses connect Mexico City to other parts of the country. Driving in Mexico City can be challenging due to traffic congestion and limited parking, but the city has a well-developed network of highways and toll roads.\n\nAdditionally, the city has invested in alternative modes of transportation, such as bike-sharing systems and pedestrianized zones, to reduce traffic congestion and promote sustainability. The city's transportation system is relatively affordable, with a single metro ride costing around 5 pesos (approximately 0.25 USD). However, traffic congestion and air pollution remain significant challenges, and visitors are advised to plan their routes and transportation in advance to minimize delays and discomfort.",
