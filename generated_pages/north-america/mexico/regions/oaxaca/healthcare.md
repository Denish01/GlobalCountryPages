[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Oaxaca's healthcare system is a combination of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of care for the majority of the population. The **Mexican Ministry of Health** oversees the public system, which includes hospitals, clinics, and health centers. The quality of care in Oaxaca varies, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. In recent years, the state has made efforts to improve healthcare infrastructure and access, particularly in rural areas. However, challenges persist, including a shortage of specialized doctors and limited access to advanced medical equipment.

The public healthcare system in Oaxaca is divided into two main components: the **Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)**, which provides healthcare to formal sector workers, and the **Secretaría de Salud (SSA)**, which provides healthcare to the general population. Private healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics, also play a significant role in the state's healthcare system, particularly for those who can afford to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance. The quality of care in private facilities is generally higher than in public facilities, but it can be expensive.

Despite the challenges, Oaxaca has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes in recent years. The state has implemented various programs to reduce **infant mortality**, improve **vaccination rates**, and increase access to **specialized care**. Additionally, the state has invested in **health education** and **disease prevention** initiatives, which have helped to reduce the burden of **chronic diseases** such as diabetes and hypertension.
