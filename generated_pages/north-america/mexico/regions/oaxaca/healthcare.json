  "content": "Healthcare in Oaxaca is a mixed system that combines public and private providers, with varying levels of quality and access, particularly between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 068\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nOaxaca's healthcare system is a combination of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of care for the majority of the population. The **Mexican Ministry of Health** oversees the public system, which includes hospitals, clinics, and health centers. The quality of care in Oaxaca varies, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. In recent years, the state has made efforts to improve healthcare infrastructure and access, particularly in rural areas. However, challenges persist, including a shortage of specialized doctors and limited access to advanced medical equipment.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Oaxaca is divided into two main components: the **Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)**, which provides healthcare to formal sector workers, and the **Secretaría de Salud (SSA)**, which provides healthcare to the general population. Private healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics, also play a significant role in the state's healthcare system, particularly for those who can afford to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance. The quality of care in private facilities is generally higher than in public facilities, but it can be expensive.\n\nDespite the challenges, Oaxaca has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes in recent years. The state has implemented various programs to reduce **infant mortality**, improve **vaccination rates**, and increase access to **specialized care**. Additionally, the state has invested in **health education** and **disease prevention** initiatives, which have helped to reduce the burden of **chronic diseases** such as diabetes and hypertension.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital General de Oaxaca | Oaxaca City | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad | Oaxaca City | Public | Cardiology, oncology, neurology | Limited |\n| Clinica de Especialidades | Oaxaca City | Private | Orthopedics, dermatology, ophthalmology | Yes |\n| Hospital Angeles | Oaxaca City | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Centro Médico de Oaxaca | Oaxaca City | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Hospital de la Mujer | Oaxaca City | Public | Obstetrics, gynecology, neonatology | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **IMSS** is the primary public health insurance provider in Oaxaca, covering formal sector workers and their families.\n- **Seguro Popular** is a government-sponsored health insurance program for low-income individuals and families.\n- Private health insurance is available from companies such as **AXA** and **Allianz**, but can be expensive.\n- **Expats** and foreign visitors may be able to purchase private health insurance that covers them in Oaxaca.\n- **Travel insurance** is also available for short-term visitors, but may not provide comprehensive coverage.\n- **Local insurance options** may have limited coverage and higher deductibles, so it's essential to carefully review policies before purchasing.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in Oaxaca, but may require a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also widely available, but may not always be of the same quality as those found in other countries.\n- **Common brands** such as **Tylenol** and **Advil** are available in many pharmacies.\n- **Generic medications** are often cheaper than brand-name medications, but may not always be of the same quality.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies located throughout urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Oaxaca.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for those who will be working with animals or spending time in rural areas.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Oaxaca, particularly in the **Isthmus of Tehuantepec** region.\n- **Dengue fever** and **Zika virus** are also present in Oaxaca, particularly during the rainy season.\n- **Waterborne illnesses** such as **giardiasis** and **cryptosporidiosis** are common in Oaxaca, so it's essential to drink bottled or filtered water.\n- **Foodborne illnesses** such as **salmonellosis** and **E. coli** are also common, so it's essential to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and seafood.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Oaxaca** is not a major medical tourism destination, but some private hospitals and clinics may offer specialized services such as **orthopedic surgery** and **cosmetic surgery**.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical procedures in Oaxaca compared to other countries, but quality and safety may vary.\n- **Accredited hospitals** such as the **Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad** may offer high-quality care, but it's essential to research and carefully evaluate any medical facility before seeking treatment.\n- **Language barriers** may be a challenge for medical tourists, as not all medical staff speak English fluently.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, dial **068** for an ambulance or visit the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can be a challenge in rural areas, so it's essential to have a plan in place in case of an emergency.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found in urban areas such as Oaxaca City, but may be farther away in rural areas.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, so it's essential to have all necessary documents and information readily available.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in severe cases, particularly if specialized care is not available in Oaxaca.",
