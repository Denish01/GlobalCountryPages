[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Oaxaca is a region in southern Mexico that experiences a tropical savanna climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from October to May, is characterized by warm temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the region. The wet season, which runs from June to September, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, which can make travel more challenging. The climate in Oaxaca varies depending on the elevation, with the coastal regions being generally hotter and more humid than the mountainous areas.

The dry season is the best time to visit Oaxaca's beaches, such as **Puerto Escondido**, where you can enjoy swimming, surfing, and other water sports. The dry season is also the best time to explore the region's **archaeological sites**, such as Monte Albán and Mitla, which are less crowded and more pleasant to visit during this time. In contrast, the wet season is the best time to visit Oaxaca's **cloud forests**, where the rainfall brings out the lush greenery and vibrant wildflowers.

The seasons in Oaxaca also affect the region's **festivals and events**, with many of the most important celebrations taking place during the dry season. For example, the **Guelaguetza**, a traditional Oaxacan festival, takes place in July, but the preparations and smaller celebrations start in June and continue through August. The dry season is also the best time to experience Oaxaca's **cuisine**, which is known for its rich flavors and vibrant colors, with many of the region's signature dishes, such as **mole** and **tlayudas**, being made with fresh ingredients that are readily available during this time.
