Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to September. Avoid: September to November due to the heavy rainfall and potential hurricanes. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nOaxaca is a region in southern Mexico that experiences a tropical savanna climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from October to May, is characterized by warm temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit the region. The wet season, which runs from June to September, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, which can make travel more challenging. The climate in Oaxaca varies depending on the elevation, with the coastal regions being generally hotter and more humid than the mountainous areas.\n\nThe dry season is the best time to visit Oaxaca's beaches, such as **Puerto Escondido**, where you can enjoy swimming, surfing, and other water sports. The dry season is also the best time to explore the region's **archaeological sites**, such as Monte Albán and Mitla, which are less crowded and more pleasant to visit during this time. In contrast, the wet season is the best time to visit Oaxaca's **cloud forests**, where the rainfall brings out the lush greenery and vibrant wildflowers.\n\nThe seasons in Oaxaca also affect the region's **festivals and events**, with many of the most important celebrations taking place during the dry season. For example, the **Guelaguetza**, a traditional Oaxacan festival, takes place in July, but the preparations and smaller celebrations start in June and continue through August. The dry season is also the best time to experience Oaxaca's **cuisine**, which is known for its rich flavors and vibrant colors, with many of the region's signature dishes, such as **mole** and **tlayudas**, being made with fresh ingredients that are readily available during this time.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Mild, dry | Low | $ | Hiking, visiting archaeological sites |\n| February | Mild, dry | Med | $$ | Visiting beaches, attending festivals |\n| March | Warm, dry | Med | $$ | Exploring cities, trying local cuisine |\n| April | Warm, dry | Med | $$ | Visiting natural wonders, attending cultural events |\n| May | Hot, dry | Low | $ | Visiting cloud forests, hiking |\n| June | Hot, wet | Low | $ | Visiting beaches, attending music festivals |\n| July | Hot, wet | Med | $$ | Attending the Guelaguetza, visiting archaeological sites |\n| August | Hot, wet | Med | $$ | Visiting natural wonders, trying local cuisine |\n| September | Hot, wet | Low | $ | Visiting cloud forests, hiking |\n| October | Mild, dry | Low | $ | Visiting beaches, attending festivals |\n| November | Mild, dry | Med | $$ | Exploring cities, trying local cuisine |\n| December | Mild, dry | High | $$$ | Visiting archaeological sites, attending cultural events |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Guelaguetza | July | A traditional Oaxacan festival celebrating the region's indigenous heritage |\n| Día de los Muertos | November | A celebration of the Day of the Dead, with parades, altars, and traditional foods |\n| Fiesta de la Vendimia | August | A wine harvest festival in the town of Valle de Guadalupe |\n| Festival de Música de Oaxaca | June | A music festival featuring traditional and contemporary music from Oaxaca and around the world |\n| Feria de Artesanías | December | A craft fair featuring traditional Oaxacan handicrafts, such as textiles and pottery |\n| Noche de Rabanos | December | A festival celebrating the radish, with elaborate radish sculptures and traditional foods |\n| Fiesta de la Candelaria | February | A celebration of the Virgin of Candelaria, with music, dance, and traditional foods |\n| Festival de Jazz de Oaxaca | October | A jazz festival featuring local and international musicians |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **coastal regions**, such as Puerto Escondido and Huatulco, have a hotter and more humid climate than the **mountainous areas**, such as Oaxaca City and the Sierra Norte.\n- The **cloud forests**, such as the Sierra Norte and the Mixteca, are cooler and more humid than the rest of the region, with a distinct climate and ecosystem.\n- The **Isthmus of Tehuantepec**, a narrow strip of land connecting the region to the rest of Mexico, has a unique cultural and linguistic identity, with a blend of indigenous and African influences.\n- The **valleys and canyons**, such as the Valle de Tlacolula and the Cañón del Zopilote, have a dry and hot climate, with a distinct geology and ecosystem.\n- The **highlands**, such as the Sierra de Juárez and the Sierra de Zongolica, have a cooler and more temperate climate, with a distinct cultural and linguistic identity.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tours well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from May to June or from September to October, when the weather is still pleasant and the crowds are smaller.\n- Pack light and breathable clothing, as well as comfortable shoes, to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable trip.\n- Don't forget to try the local cuisine, which is known for its rich flavors and vibrant colors, and to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.\n- Be respectful of the local culture and traditions, especially during festivals and celebrations, and to learn a few basic phrases in Spanish to interact with the locals.\n- Avoid traveling during the heavy rainfall and potential hurricanes, from September to November, and to check the weather forecast before heading out each day.",
