Baja California is easily accessible by air, with several international airports receiving direct flights from major hubs in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Los Cabos International Airport (SJD) is a popular entry point, especially for tourists heading to the southern tip of the peninsula. Tijuana International Airport (TIJ) is another major airport, located near the US-Mexico border, and is a convenient option for those traveling from the western United States. Additionally, there are several land border crossings, including the San Ysidro Port of Entry, which connects Tijuana to San Diego, California.

For those traveling overland, there are several bus companies that offer cross-border services, including Greyhound and Autotransportes de Baja California. These buses typically depart from major cities in the western United States, such as Los Angeles and San Diego, and arrive in Tijuana or other major cities in Baja California. Alternatively, you can drive to Baja California from the United States, using one of the several land border crossings along the California-Baja California border.

Baja California has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights to and from major cities in Mexico.

Approximate costs for domestic flights in Mexico range from $50 to $200 USD, depending on the route and time of booking.

Baja California does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option in the region.

For now, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars.
