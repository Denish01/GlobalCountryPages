[SECTION] How Baja California Is Divided [/SECTION]
Baja California is a peninsula in northwestern Mexico, divided into two states: Baja California and Baja California Sur. The administrative structure of the region is based on the federal system of Mexico, with each state having its own government and capital city. Baja California is the more populous of the two states, with a larger economy and more urbanized areas, while Baja California Sur is known for its natural beauty and tourist attractions. The division between the two states is largely historical and cultural, with Baja California being more closely tied to the US-Mexico border and the city of Tijuana, while Baja California Sur is more focused on tourism and the conservation of its natural resources.

The division between the two states has also led to differences in their economic development, with Baja California having a more diversified economy and a stronger presence of industries such as manufacturing and agriculture, while Baja California Sur has a more service-based economy, with a focus on tourism and hospitality. Despite these differences, both states share a common cultural heritage and a strong sense of identity as part of the Baja California region.
