[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Baja California is a combination of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of care for the majority of the population. The public system is funded by the government and provides **universal healthcare** to all citizens, including expats who have obtained a residence visa. However, the quality of care and access to specialized services can vary greatly between urban and rural areas. In urban areas such as Tijuana and Mexicali, there are many high-quality private hospitals and clinics that cater to expats and medical tourists, offering a range of specialized services and modern facilities. In contrast, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services, with fewer hospitals and clinics, and a shortage of specialized medical professionals.

The quality of care in Baja California is generally good, with many medical professionals being trained in the US or Europe. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, as well as between urban and rural areas. Expats and medical tourists often prefer to use private hospitals and clinics, which offer a higher level of care and more modern facilities. The public system, on the other hand, can be overcrowded and understaffed, particularly in rural areas.

Despite these challenges, Baja California has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to care and improving the quality of services. The region has also become a popular destination for medical tourism, with many hospitals and clinics catering to international patients.
