[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Mexico has several major international airports, with Benito Juárez International Airport in Mexico City and Cancun International Airport being the primary hubs. Many major airlines offer direct flights to these airports from destinations in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world. Additionally, there are several land border crossings from the United States, Guatemala, and Belize, making it easy to enter the country by car or bus. Some popular overland entry points include the border towns of Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Reynosa, which offer bus and shuttle services to major cities in Mexico.

If you're planning to visit Mexico from the United States, you can also consider taking a bus or shuttle from cities like Los Angeles, San Diego, or El Paso, which offer frequent departures to major Mexican cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Alternatively, you can take a flight from a smaller airport in the United States to a regional airport in Mexico, such as Puerto Vallarta or Cozumel. With its extensive transportation network, getting to Mexico is relatively easy, and you can choose the option that best suits your budget and travel style.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Mexico has an extensive domestic air network, with several major airlines offering flights to destinations throughout the country. Some of the main domestic airlines include Aeromexico, Interjet, and VivaAerobus, which offer frequent flights to major cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agency, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. On average, a one-way domestic flight can cost between $50 and $200 USD, depending on the route and airline. It's a good idea to book in advance to get the best prices, especially during peak travel seasons like summer and holidays.

When booking domestic flights, it's also a good idea to consider the airport fees and taxes, which can add up quickly. Some airlines may also offer package deals or promotions that include hotel stays or car rentals, which can be a good option if you're planning a longer trip. Additionally, some airports in Mexico may have limited flight options, so it's a good idea to research the airport and airline before booking your flight.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Mexico's rail network is limited, with only a few routes available, mostly for freight transport. However, there are some passenger train services, such as the Tequila Express, which runs from Guadalajara to Tequila, and the Copper Canyon Railway, which runs from Chihuahua to Los Mochis. These trains offer a scenic and comfortable way to see the countryside, but they are not a practical option for getting around the country. If you're interested in taking the train, it's best to book in advance, as seats can fill up quickly, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Mexico has an extensive network of intercity buses, with several major companies offering routes to destinations throughout the country. Some of the main bus companies include Estrella de Oro, Primera Plus, and ADO, which offer a range of services from budget-friendly to luxury. Bus travel is a popular option in Mexico, as it's often cheaper than flying and can be a more scenic way to see the countryside. Prices vary depending on the route and class of service, but you can expect to pay between $10 and $50 USD for a one-way ticket.
