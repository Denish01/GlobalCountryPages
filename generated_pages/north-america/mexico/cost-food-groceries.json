In general, local markets tend to be cheaper than supermarkets, particularly for fresh produce and meats.\n\nHowever, supermarkets often have a wider selection of products, including imported goods, and may offer more convenient shopping hours and payment options. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to be aware of the **bargaining norms**, which can vary depending on the vendor and the product. In general, it's a good idea to start with a lower offer and be prepared to negotiate. Additionally, some vendors may offer discounts for bulk purchases or for paying in cash. By understanding the differences between supermarkets and local markets, shoppers can make informed decisions about where to buy their groceries and get the best value for their money.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at **street food stalls** or local eateries is a great way to sample traditional Mexican cuisine at affordable prices.\n- **Tacos al pastor** and **tortas** are two popular and affordable dishes that can be found at many street food stalls and restaurants.\n- **Fresh produce** like fruits and vegetables is widely available at local markets and is often cheaper than at supermarkets.\n- **Local cheese** and **meats** like chicken and beef are also good value and can be found at many markets and butcher shops.\n- **Avoid buying imported goods**, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local products.\n- **Drink tap water** or buy bottled water from a reputable source to avoid overpriced drinks at restaurants and cafes.",
