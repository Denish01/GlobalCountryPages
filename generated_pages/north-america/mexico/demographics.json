  "content": "Mexico is home to a diverse population of approximately 130 million people, with a mix of indigenous, European, and African influences. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: (130 million)\nPopulation Growth Rate: (1.0%)\nMedian Age: (29 years)\nUrban Population: (77%)\nPopulation Density: (66 per km2)\nLife Expectancy: (72 years)\nFertility Rate: (2.1 children per woman)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nMexico's population is the second-largest in Latin America, after Brazil, and is characterized by a relatively young age structure. The population has been growing steadily, with a growth rate of around 1.0% per annum. However, this growth rate is expected to slow down in the coming years due to declining fertility rates. Mexico's population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with around 77% of the population living in urban areas. This trend is driven by economic opportunities, improved access to education and healthcare, and a higher standard of living in cities.\n\nMexico's population growth has been accompanied by significant migration patterns, both within the country and across its borders. Many Mexicans have migrated to the United States in search of better economic opportunities, while others have moved from rural areas to cities within Mexico. This migration has had a significant impact on the country's demographics, with many urban areas experiencing rapid growth and development.\n\nThe population of Mexico is also characterized by a significant regional diversity, with different regions having distinct cultural, economic, and demographic profiles. The northern states, such as Chihuahua and Baja California, have a strong presence of **maquiladoras** (foreign-owned factories) and a growing middle class, while the southern states, such as Chiapas and Oaxaca, have a larger indigenous population and a more traditional way of life.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mestizo | 62% | Nationwide | Mixed European and indigenous ancestry |\n| Indigenous | 21% | Southern states | Includes languages such as **Nahuatl**, **Maya**, and **Zapotec** |\n| European | 10% | Northern states | Primarily of Spanish descent |\n| Afro-Mexican | 2% | Coastal regions | Descendants of African slaves |\n| Asian | 1% | Urban areas | Primarily of Chinese and Korean descent |\n| Other | 4% | Nationwide | Includes Arab, Jewish, and other minority groups |\n[/TABLE]\nMexico's ethnic diversity is a significant aspect of its cultural identity, with a mix of indigenous, European, African, and Asian influences.
