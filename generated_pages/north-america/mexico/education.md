[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Mexico is divided into three main levels: **primary education**, which includes six years of basic education, **secondary education**, which includes three years of lower secondary education and three years of upper secondary education, and **tertiary education**, which includes higher education institutions such as universities and technical colleges. The quality of education in Mexico varies depending on the institution and the location, with public schools generally considered to be of lower quality than private schools. However, in recent years, the government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods.

The education system in Mexico is overseen by the **Ministry of Public Education**, which is responsible for setting education policy and overseeing the implementation of education programs. The ministry has implemented various initiatives aimed at improving education outcomes, including programs to improve teacher training and to increase access to education for disadvantaged groups. Despite these efforts, the education system in Mexico still faces various challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources.

In terms of public versus private education, Mexico has a large and well-established private education sector, with many private schools and universities offering high-quality education programs. However, these institutions are often expensive and out of reach for many Mexican families, who rely on the public education system. The public education system, on the other hand, is generally considered to be of lower quality, but it is free and accessible to all.
