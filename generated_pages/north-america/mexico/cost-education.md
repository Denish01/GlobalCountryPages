[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Mexico is overseen by the **Secretariat of Public Education** (SEP), which sets the curriculum and standards for public and private schools. Public schools in Mexico are generally free or subsidized, and they provide a good quality education, although the quality can vary depending on the region and the school. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality education, with smaller class sizes and more resources, but they can be expensive. The language of instruction in Mexican schools is **Spanish**, although some private schools may offer bilingual or English-language programs. Compulsory education in Mexico lasts for 12 years, from primary school (ages 6-11) to secondary school (ages 12-15) and preparatory school (ages 16-18). International schools are available in major cities like Mexico City and Guadalajara, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** (IB) and **Cambridge International Examinations** (CIE).

The quality of education in Mexico's public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. However, there are also many excellent public schools, particularly in urban areas, that offer a high-quality education. Private schools, on the other hand, are generally considered to be of higher quality, with better facilities, smaller class sizes, and more qualified teachers. International schools in Mexico offer a range of curricula and are often preferred by expats and international students. These schools typically have a high-quality education system, with experienced teachers and modern facilities.
