Public schools in Mexico are generally free or subsidized, and they provide a good quality education, although the quality can vary depending on the region and the school. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality education, with smaller class sizes and more resources, but they can be expensive. The language of instruction in Mexican schools is **Spanish**, although some private schools may offer bilingual or English-language programs. Compulsory education in Mexico lasts for 12 years, from primary school (ages 6-11) to secondary school (ages 12-15) and preparatory school (ages 16-18). International schools are available in major cities like Mexico City and Guadalajara, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** (IB) and **Cambridge International Examinations** (CIE).\n\nThe quality of education in Mexico's public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. However, there are also many excellent public schools, particularly in urban areas, that offer a high-quality education. Private schools, on the other hand, are generally considered to be of higher quality, with better facilities, smaller class sizes, and more qualified teachers. International schools in Mexico offer a range of curricula and are often preferred by expats and international students. These schools typically have a high-quality education system, with experienced teachers and modern facilities.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 - $100 | Free or subsidized, quality can vary |\n| Private Primary | $1,000 - $5,000 | Range by tier, from basic to elite |\n| Public Secondary | $0 - $200 | Free or subsidized, quality can vary |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000 - $10,000 | Range by tier, from basic to elite |\n| International School | $5,000 - $20,000 | Curriculum types include IB, CIE, and US-style |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $0 - $1,000 | $1,000 - $3,000 | Low tuition fees, but admission can be competitive |\n| Private University | $2,000 - $10,000 | $5,000 - $20,000 | Range by tier, from basic to elite |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000 - $15,000 | $10,000 - $30,000 | Examples include **Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México** (UNAM) and **Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México** (ITAM) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100 - $500 | Range by quality and location |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20 - $100 | Range by subject and tutor qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $200 - $1,000 | Range by level and institution |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50 - $200 | Basic supplies, including books and materials |\n| School Uniform | $50 - $200 | Required for many private and public schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **best schools for expats** in Mexico are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and a high-quality education.\n- **Scholarship availability** is limited for international students, but some universities and private schools offer merit-based or need-based scholarships.\n- **Online learning options** are becoming increasingly popular in Mexico, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in Mexico is generally considered to be **lower than in the US and Canada**, but higher than in many other Latin American countries.\n- **Bilingual education** is becoming increasingly popular in Mexico, with many schools offering English-language programs and courses.\n- For students who want to study in Mexico, it's recommended to **research thoroughly** and consider factors such as tuition fees, living costs, and scholarship availability before making a decision.",
