# Mexico Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Mexico before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Mexico has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country offers visa-free access to citizens of over 60 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many European nations. This makes Mexico a popular destination for tourists and business travelers alike. The Mexican government has implemented various visa programs to facilitate travel and tourism, including the Electronic Authorization System (SAE) for citizens of certain countries.

The visa policy of Mexico is designed to balance the need to facilitate international travel and trade with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration. The country has a well-developed system for processing visa applications, and most tourists and business travelers can obtain the necessary documents with relative ease. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and travelers should always check with the official embassy or consulate of Mexico for the latest information.
