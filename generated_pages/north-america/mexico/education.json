The quality of education in Mexico varies depending on the institution and the location, with public schools generally considered to be of lower quality than private schools. However, in recent years, the government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods.\n\nThe education system in Mexico is overseen by the **Ministry of Public Education**, which is responsible for setting education policy and overseeing the implementation of education programs. The ministry has implemented various initiatives aimed at improving education outcomes, including programs to improve teacher training and to increase access to education for disadvantaged groups.
