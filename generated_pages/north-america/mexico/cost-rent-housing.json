The rental market is relatively well-developed, with many apartments and houses available for rent in major cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Puerto Vallarta. Typical lease terms in Mexico are 6-12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it's still important for renters to carefully review their lease agreements and understand their obligations. Compared to its regional neighbors, Mexico's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in the United States but higher than in some parts of Central America.\n\nThe Mexican government has implemented various programs to support affordable housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable housing units. However, the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, remains high, and prices can be steep in desirable neighborhoods. Expats and foreigners may find that they have to pay a premium for housing in certain areas, especially if they are not fluent in Spanish or familiar with the local market.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | small, basic units |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | standard apartment with kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,200 | $400-$900 | family-sized apartment with two bedrooms and living area |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,000-$2,000 | $600-$1,500 | spacious apartment with three bedrooms and multiple living areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$3,500 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | residential areas, family-friendly neighborhoods |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | countryside, farmhouses, or village homes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Polanco**: upscale neighborhood in Mexico City with high-end shopping and dining options, rent range $800-$1,500 USD per month\n- **Condesa**: trendy neighborhood in Mexico City with a mix of modern and art deco architecture, rent range $600-$1,200 USD per month\n- **Romita**: family-friendly neighborhood in Mexico City with a suburban feel, rent range $400-$900 USD per month\n- **Puerto Vallarta**: coastal city with a vibrant expat community, rent range $400-$1,000 USD per month\n- **San Miguel de Allende**: historic town with a large expat population, rent range $300-$800 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Mexico [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your lifestyle and budget\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a reliable landlord\n- Be prepared to pay a security deposit and first month's rent upfront\n- Negotiate the price and terms of your lease agreement, if possible\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment to avoid the hassle of buying furniture\n- Be aware of scams and never send money or sign a lease without seeing the property in person\n- Utilities such as water, electricity, and gas are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Learn some basic Spanish phrases to communicate with your landlord and navigate the local market [CALLOUT] It's essential to understand the local culture and customs to avoid any misunderstandings or conflicts.",
