[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Mexico is diverse, with many regional dialects and minority languages spoken throughout the country. Mexican Spanish, also known as **Mexican Spanish dialect**, has distinct pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar that differ from other Spanish-speaking countries. The country is home to over 60 indigenous languages, including **Maya** and **Nahuatl**, which are spoken by around 10% of the population. While English is not an official language, it is widely understood in tourist areas, hotels, and among businesspeople, particularly in larger cities like Mexico City and Cancun. However, English proficiency can be limited in rural areas, and it is always a good idea to learn some basic Spanish phrases to communicate with locals.

Regional dialects in Mexico vary greatly, with distinct accents and vocabulary used in different parts of the country. For example, the **Yucatecan dialect** spoken in the Yucatan Peninsula is known for its unique pronunciation and vocabulary, which is influenced by the Maya language. In contrast, the **Northern Mexican dialect** spoken in states like Chihuahua and Sonora has a distinct accent and vocabulary that is influenced by American English.

Minority languages in Mexico are an important part of the country's cultural heritage, and many efforts are being made to preserve and promote these languages. The Mexican government has established programs to support the development of indigenous languages, including language education and cultural preservation initiatives. Additionally, many organizations and communities are working to document and promote the use of minority languages, particularly among young people.
