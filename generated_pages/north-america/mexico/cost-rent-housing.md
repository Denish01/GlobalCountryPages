[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Mexico's housing market is a mix of modern and traditional, with a wide range of options available for renters and buyers. The rental market is relatively well-developed, with many apartments and houses available for rent in major cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Puerto Vallarta. Typical lease terms in Mexico are 6-12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it's still important for renters to carefully review their lease agreements and understand their obligations. Compared to its regional neighbors, Mexico's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in the United States but higher than in some parts of Central America.

The Mexican government has implemented various programs to support affordable housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable housing units. However, the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, remains high, and prices can be steep in desirable neighborhoods. Expats and foreigners may find that they have to pay a premium for housing in certain areas, especially if they are not fluent in Spanish or familiar with the local market.
