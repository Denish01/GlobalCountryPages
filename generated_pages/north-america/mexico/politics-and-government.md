The federal government has the power to make laws and policies for the entire country, while the state governments have the power to make laws and policies for their respective states. This division of power is established by the **Constitution of Mexico**, which was adopted in 1917 and has been amended several times since then. The Constitution establishes the principles of **democracy**, **federalism**, and **separation of powers**, and guarantees the rights and freedoms of Mexican citizens.
