However, there is still a significant urban-rural divide, with internet speeds and availability being generally better in cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey, than in rural areas. The reliability of the internet can also be a issue, with outages and slow speeds being common, especially during peak hours.\n\nIn general, the internet quality in Mexico is good enough for most users, with average speeds of around 25 Mbps download, which is sufficient for streaming, browsing, and online work. However, the quality of the internet can vary depending on the location and the provider, so it's a good idea to research and compare different options before choosing an internet service provider. Additionally, the Mexican government has implemented initiatives to improve the country's digital infrastructure, including the deployment of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Mexico is relatively easy, with many options available for tourists and travelers.

To get a SIM card, you will need to provide some identification, such as a passport, and possibly a proof of address. You can buy SIM cards at airports, carriers' stores, and many convenience stores and supermarkets.\n\nThe cost of a SIM card can vary depending on the carrier and the plan, but you can expect to pay around 10 USD for a tourist SIM card.
