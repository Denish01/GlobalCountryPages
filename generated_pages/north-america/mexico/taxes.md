To be considered a tax resident, an individual must have a permanent home in Mexico, be present in the country for more than 183 days in a calendar year, or have a spouse or dependents who are tax residents.

The Mexican tax system is complex, with various taxes and exemptions applicable to different types of income. Understanding the tax system and residency rules is essential for individuals and businesses to ensure compliance with tax laws and take advantage of available tax incentives.
