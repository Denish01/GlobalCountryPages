[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Honduras is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a four-year term and is limited to two terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Congress, which has 128 members elected by proportional representation for four-year terms. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court of Justice, which has 15 members appointed by the National Congress for seven-year terms.

The separation of powers in Honduras is designed to provide checks and balances among the branches, ensuring that no one branch has too much power. The President has the power to appoint ministers and other high-ranking officials, but the National Congress must approve these appointments. The National Congress has the power to pass laws, but the President can veto them. The Supreme Court of Justice has the power to interpret laws and declare them unconstitutional.

Honduras has a **unitary system**, where the central government has the primary authority to make decisions and policies. The country is divided into 18 departments, which are further divided into municipalities. While the departments and municipalities have some autonomy, the central government still maintains significant control over them.
