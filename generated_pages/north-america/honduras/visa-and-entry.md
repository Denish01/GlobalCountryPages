# Honduras Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Honduras before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Honduras has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country offers visa-free access to citizens of over 80 countries, including the United States, Canada, and most European nations. This policy aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel to Honduras, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. The visa policy is subject to change, so it is essential to check with the Honduran embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information before planning a trip.

Honduras is a member of the Central American Integration System (SICA), which allows for the free movement of citizens between member countries. This means that citizens of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua can enter Honduras without a visa and stay for up to 90 days. Citizens of other countries may need to obtain a visa on arrival or before their trip, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit.
