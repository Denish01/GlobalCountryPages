[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Honduras has a relatively large population compared to its neighboring countries, with a population size that has been steadily increasing over the years.

The country's urban population accounts for around 57% of the total population, with the majority residing in cities such as Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, and Choloma. Honduras has experienced significant migration patterns, with many citizens emigrating to the United States and other countries in search of better economic opportunities. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with many Hondurans maintaining strong ties to their homeland.

The population of Honduras is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 22.5 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is in the working-age group. However, it also presents opportunities for economic growth and development, as a young and dynamic population can drive innovation and entrepreneurship. The country's population density is approximately 93 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

Honduras has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards in recent years, but the country still faces significant development challenges. The population's access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation is uneven, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education.
