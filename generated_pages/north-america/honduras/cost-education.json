  "content": "The cost of education in Honduras varies depending on the type of institution and level of study, with public education being generally free or low-cost, while private and international schools can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 4.5%\nLiteracy Rate: 89%\nSchool System: 6 years of primary education, 3 years of lower secondary education, and 2 years of upper secondary education\nAcademic Year: 10 months\nCurrency: HNL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Honduras is divided into public and private institutions, with public schools being generally free or low-cost, but often lacking in resources and quality. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction in Honduras is **Spanish**, and compulsory education lasts for 11 years, from primary to upper secondary level. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **American** programs.\n\nThe quality of education in Honduras is a concern, with many public schools facing challenges such as limited resources, outdated curricula, and inadequate teacher training. Private schools, on the other hand, often have better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum. However, these schools are not accessible to many Hondurans, due to the high cost of tuition. International schools offer a high-quality education, but are often very expensive and cater mainly to expatriate families and wealthy locals.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, large class sizes |\n| Private Primary | $500-$1,500 | Better facilities, smaller class sizes |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, large class sizes |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$3,000 | Better facilities, smaller class sizes |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | American, British, or International Baccalaureate curriculum |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited programs, outdated facilities |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Better facilities, more programs |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras (UNAH) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited availability, especially in rural areas |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$30 | Common for students who need extra help |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | English, French, or other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic materials, such as notebooks and pens |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats are often international schools, which offer a high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- Scholarship opportunities are limited, but some universities and organizations offer **merit-based** or **need-based** scholarships to deserving students.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular, with some universities and institutions offering **distance learning** programs.\n- The education quality in Honduras is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, but there are some excellent schools and universities that offer a high-quality education.\n- **Bilingual** programs are becoming more popular, especially in private schools, as English becomes an increasingly important language in the global economy.\n- Parents should research schools carefully and consider factors such as **curriculum**, **teacher quality**, and **facilities** when choosing a school for their child.",
