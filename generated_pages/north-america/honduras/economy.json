The country has experienced steady economic growth, with a GDP growth rate averaging around 3.5% per year over the past decade. However, Honduras still faces significant development challenges, including high levels of poverty and inequality. The economy is heavily dependent on exports, particularly of **coffee**, **bananas**, and **textiles**, which are vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. The country has also made efforts to diversify its economy, with a growing focus on **tourism** and **manufacturing**.\n\nThe Honduran economy has been driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment, as well as remittances from abroad. The country has a large diaspora community, with many Hondurans living and working in the United States, who send back significant amounts of money to support their families. This has helped to boost economic growth and reduce poverty. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including high levels of crime and corruption, which can deter investment and hinder economic development.\n\nDespite these challenges, Honduras has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing a range of economic reforms aimed at improving the business environment and promoting investment. The country has also made efforts to improve its infrastructure, including the development of new transportation networks and energy systems. Overall, the Honduran economy has the potential for significant growth and development, but will require continued investment and reform efforts to achieve its full potential.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 14% of GDP | **coffee**, **bananas**, **cotton**, and **sugar** are major crops |\n| Manufacturing | 20% of GDP | **textiles**, **apparel**, and **food processing** are key sectors |\n| Services | 60% of GDP | **tourism**, **finance**, and **transportation** are major contributors |\n| Mining | 2% of GDP | **gold**, **silver**, and **copper** are extracted, with potential for growth |\n| Construction | 5% of GDP | **infrastructure development**, **real estate**, and **public works** projects |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **coffee**, which is the country's main export crop\n- **bananas**, which are a significant export crop\n- **textiles**, particularly **apparel** and **fabrics**\n- **gold**, which is a growing export sector\n- **palm oil**, which is a major export crop\n**Top Imports:** \n- **petroleum products**\n- **machinery**\n- **vehicles**\n- **electronic equipment**\n- **pharmaceuticals**\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- **United States**, which is the country's largest trading partner\n- **China**, which is a significant trading partner\n- **Guatemala**, which is a major trading partner in the region\n- **El Salvador**, which is also a significant trading partner in the region\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country has a well-developed **transportation network**, with major highways connecting the capital city to the rest of the country\n- **Energy** production is primarily based on **hydroelectric power**, with some **thermal** and **renewable energy** sources\n- **Internet** and **mobile phone** penetration is relatively high, with over 70% of the population having access to mobile phones\n- The country has several major **ports**, including the **Port of Puerto Cortes**, which is a key export hub\n- **Tegucigalpa** and **San Pedro Sula** are the country's two major **airports**, with connections to major cities in the region and beyond\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nHonduras's economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment, as well as remittances from abroad.
