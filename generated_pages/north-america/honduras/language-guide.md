The linguistic landscape of Honduras is dominated by **Spanish**, which is the official language and the mother tongue of the vast majority of the population. There are also several indigenous languages spoken in the country, including **Garifuna**, **Miskito**, and **Mayan**, which are spoken by smaller communities, particularly in the coastal and border regions. English is not widely spoken, except in tourist areas and among some businesspeople, and even then, proficiency is generally limited. Regional dialects of Spanish are also spoken in Honduras, with the most notable being the **Honduran dialect**, which has its own distinct pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar.

The use of **indigenous languages** is an important part of Honduran cultural heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote these languages. However, **Spanish** remains the dominant language, and it is the language used in most aspects of public life, including government, education, and media. In terms of **English proficiency**, Honduras has a relatively low level, with many people having limited or no proficiency in the language. This can make communication challenging for tourists and business visitors who do not speak **Spanish**.

Overall, the linguistic landscape of Honduras is characterized by a dominant **Spanish**-speaking population, with smaller communities of indigenous language speakers and limited **English** proficiency. Understanding the local language and culture is essential for effective communication and building relationships in Honduras.
