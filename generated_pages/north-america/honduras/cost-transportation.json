The main modes of transportation in Honduras are buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. Most people in Honduras rely on buses and taxis to get around, as they are affordable and widely available. However, the quality of public transit can vary depending on the city and region, with some areas having more frequent and reliable services than others.\n\nIn larger cities like Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, there are more transportation options available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. However, in rural areas, transportation options can be limited, and people may have to rely on hitchhiking or walking to get around. The government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure in Honduras, including the construction of new roads and highways, but there is still much work to be done.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Limited coverage in some areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Honduras |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Routes vary by city and region |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Honduras |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Available in larger cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00-$3.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Uber and Cabify available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20.00-$30.00 | To city center, varies by airport |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80-$1.20 | Varies by location and time of year |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70-$1.10 | Varies by location and time of year |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30.00-$50.00 | Economy car, varies by company and location |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Varies by city and location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2.00-$5.00 | Varies by route and time of year |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$20.00 | Varies by route and company |\n| Domestic Flight | $100.00-$200.00 | Typical route, varies by airline and time of year |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Honduras |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing services to ensure safety and avoid scams.\n- Always negotiate the price before getting into a taxi, especially for longer trips.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for public transportation to save money.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas.\n- Use apps like Waze or Google Maps to navigate and find the best routes.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or for traveling to rural areas, but be aware of the costs and potential risks.",
