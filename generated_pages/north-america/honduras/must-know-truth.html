        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Honduras, officially known as the Republic of Honduras, is a sovereign country located in North America. The country's history dates back to the pre-Columbian era, with the Mayan civilization being one of the earliest known inhabitants. The Spanish colonization of Honduras began in the early 16th century, with the arrival of Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in 1524. The country was part of the Spanish Empire until it gained independence on September 15, 1821, as part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After a brief period as part of the Federal Republic of Central America, Honduras became an independent nation on November 5, 1838.</p>
        <p>The early years of independence were marked by instability and conflict, with the country experiencing several civil wars and foreign interventions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Honduras underwent significant economic development, driven by the export of bananas and other agricultural products. The country's economy continued to grow, with the discovery of gold and silver in the early 20th century. However, this growth was accompanied by social and economic inequalities, which continue to affect the country to this day.</p>
        <p>Honduras has a long history of political instability, with the country experiencing several military coups and dictatorships throughout the 20th century. The country transitioned to democracy in the 1980s, with the election of President Roberto Suazo Córdova in 1982. Since then, Honduras has held regular democratic elections, with the current president, Xiomara Castro, taking office in 2022.</p>
        <p>The country's history and culture have been shaped by its indigenous, African, and Spanish heritage. The <strong>Garifuna</strong> people, a mix of African and Caribbean descent, have a significant presence in the country, particularly along the Caribbean coast. The <strong>Lenca</strong> and <strong>Maya</strong> civilizations have also left a lasting legacy in the country's language, customs, and traditions.</p>
