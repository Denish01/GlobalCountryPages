Honduras has a more diverse economy, with a strong manufacturing sector and significant remittances from abroad, while Nicaragua's economy is more focused on agriculture and tourism. In terms of cost of living, Honduras tends to be cheaper than Nicaragua, particularly when it comes to housing and food. However, Nicaragua has a more developed tourist infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which can drive up costs in certain areas.\n\nThe cost of living in Honduras is generally lower due to its larger economy and more competitive market. The country has a lower GDP per capita than many of its Central American neighbors, but it also has a lower cost of living. Nicaragua, on the other hand, has a smaller economy and a more limited range of goods and services, which can drive up prices.
