[SECTION] How Honduras Is Divided [/SECTION]
Honduras is divided into 18 departments, which are further divided into municipalities. Each department has its own capital and is governed by a departmental governor. The departments are grouped into several regions, including the North Coast, the Mosquitia, the Central Highlands, and the Gulf of Fonseca. This administrative structure allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while also providing a framework for national governance.

The departments of Honduras vary greatly in terms of geography, climate, and economy. The North Coast departments, such as Atlántida and Colón, are known for their Caribbean coastline and banana plantations. The Mosquitia region, which includes the departments of Gracias a Dios and Colón, is a vast and sparsely populated area of tropical rainforest. The Central Highlands, which include the departments of Francisco Morazán and Comayagua, are home to the capital city, Tegucigalpa, and are known for their mountainous terrain and coffee plantations.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Honduras has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with several domestic airports, buses, and taxis. The country's main airport, Toncontín International Airport, is located in Tegucigalpa and offers flights to several major cities in Central America and the United States. There are also several smaller airports located throughout the country, including in San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba, and Roatán. Buses are a popular mode of transportation, and are available in most cities and towns. Taxis are also widely available, and are a convenient way to get around cities and towns. Driving in Honduras can be challenging, particularly in rural areas, due to poor road conditions and aggressive driving habits. However, renting a car can be a good option for those who want to explore the country at their own pace.

In addition to domestic flights, buses, and taxis, Honduras also has a network of ferries that connect the mainland to the Bay Islands. The ferry ride from La Ceiba to Roatán takes several hours, but offers stunning views of the Caribbean coastline. Overall, getting around Honduras can be relatively easy, particularly for those who are familiar with the country's transportation network. However, it's always a good idea to plan ahead, research transportation options, and exercise caution when traveling in a foreign country.
