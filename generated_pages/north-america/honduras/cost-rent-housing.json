The rental market is largely driven by demand from students, young professionals, and expatriates, with typical lease terms ranging from 6-12 months. Deposit requirements are usually equivalent to one or two months' rent, and tenants have some rights under Honduran law, including protection from eviction without due process. However, the housing market can be competitive, especially in popular areas, and tenants may need to act quickly to secure a property.\n\nIn comparison to its neighbors, Honduras has a more affordable housing market than Costa Rica or Panama, but slightly more expensive than Guatemala or Nicaragua. The country's housing market is also influenced by the **tourism industry**, with many rentals available in coastal areas and tourist hotspots. However, outside of these areas, housing prices and rents can be significantly lower. Overall, Honduras offers a range of affordable housing options, from apartments to houses, making it an attractive destination for expatriates and investors.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $150-$300 | fully furnished, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$600 | $250-$500 | spacious, modern appliances, private balcony |\n| 3 Bedroom | $450-$900 | $350-$700 | large, fully equipped kitchen, private parking |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern amenities, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, family-friendly, good schools |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | countryside, agricultural land, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Tegucigalpa's Colonia Palmira**: upscale neighborhood with modern amenities, $300-$600 USD/month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **San Pedro Sula's Zona Viva**: vibrant nightlife, restaurants, and shopping, $250-$500 USD/month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Roatán's West Bay**: beachfront properties, popular with tourists, $400-$800 USD/month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **La Ceiba's Barrio La Ceiba**: historic neighborhood, cultural attractions, $200-$400 USD/month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Comayagüela's Colonia El Centro**: affordable, central location, $150-$300 USD/month for a one-bedroom apartment\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Honduras [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and local amenities before signing a lease\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a trustworthy landlord\n- Be prepared to negotiate rent and lease terms\n- Check for any necessary repairs or maintenance before moving in\n- Consider hiring a lawyer to review the lease agreement\n- Be aware of **scams and corruption** in the rental market, and always pay rent and deposits through secure channels\n- Utilities such as water, electricity, and internet are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options may be available at a lower rent\n- Learn some basic **Spanish phrases** to communicate with your landlord and neighbors.",
