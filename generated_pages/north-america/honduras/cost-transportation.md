[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Honduras has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with limited public transportation options in some areas. The main modes of transportation in Honduras are buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. Most people in Honduras rely on buses and taxis to get around, as they are affordable and widely available. However, the quality of public transit can vary depending on the city and region, with some areas having more frequent and reliable services than others.

In larger cities like Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, there are more transportation options available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. However, in rural areas, transportation options can be limited, and people may have to rely on hitchhiking or walking to get around. The government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure in Honduras, including the construction of new roads and highways, but there is still much work to be done.
