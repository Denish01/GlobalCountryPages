There are also several indigenous languages spoken in the country, including **Garifuna**, **Miskito**, and **Mayan**, which are spoken by smaller communities, particularly in the coastal and border regions. English is not widely spoken, except in tourist areas and among some businesspeople, and even then, proficiency is generally limited. Regional dialects of Spanish are also spoken in Honduras, with the most notable being the **Honduran dialect**, which has its own distinct pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar.\n\nThe use of **indigenous languages** is an important part of Honduran cultural heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote these languages. However, **Spanish** remains the dominant language, and it is the language used in most aspects of public life, including government, education, and media. In terms of **English proficiency**, Honduras has a relatively low level, with many people having limited or no proficiency in the language. This can make communication challenging for tourists and business visitors who do not speak **Spanish**.\n\nOverall, the linguistic landscape of Honduras is characterized by a dominant **Spanish**-speaking population, with smaller communities of indigenous language speakers and limited **English** proficiency. Understanding the local language and culture is essential for effective communication and building relationships in Honduras.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola | OH-lah | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Gracias | GRAH-see-ahs | formal/informal |\n| Please | Por favor | paw-FAH-vor | formal |\n| Yes / No | Sí / No | SEE / NOH | formal/informal |\n| Excuse me | Con permiso | kohn pehr-MEE-soh | formal |\n| How much? | Cuánto cuesta | KWAHN-toh KWEHS-tah | formal/informal |\n| Where is...? | Dónde está... | DOHN-deh EH-stah | formal/informal |\n| I don't understand | No entiendo | noh ehn-tee-EHN-doh | formal/informal |\n| Do you speak English? | Habla inglés | AHB-lah eeng-lee-EHZ | formal |\n| Help! | Ayuda | ah-YOO-dah | formal/informal |\n| Goodbye | Adiós | ah-DEE-yos | formal/informal |\n| Sorry | Lo siento | LOH see-en-toh | formal |\n| How are you? | ¿Cómo estás? | KOH-moh EH-stah | formal/informal |\n| I'm fine, thank you | Estoy bien, gracias | EH-stoh bee-EHN GRAH-see-ahs | formal/informal |\n| What's your name? | ¿Cómo te llamas? | KOH-moh tay YAH-mahs | formal/informal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Uno | OO-noh |\n| 2 | Dos | dohs |\n| 3 | Tres | trays |\n| 4 | Cuatro | KWAH-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | SIHN-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | SAY-is |\n| 7 | Siete | SEE-eht-eh |\n| 8 | Ocho | OH-choh |\n| 9 | Nueve | NWAY-vay |\n| 10 | Diez | dee-EHZ |\n| 100 | Cien | see-EHN |\n| 1000 | Mil | meel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when communicating with locals, using formal titles such as **señor** or **señora**.\n- Learn some basic **Spanish** phrases to show respect and appreciation for the local culture.\n- Use **body language** and **gestures** carefully, as some gestures can have different meanings in Honduras than in other countries.\n- Avoid **public displays of affection**, as they are generally frowned upon in Honduran culture.\n- Be patient and don't get frustrated if you encounter language barriers, and try to use **visual aids** or **simple language** to communicate.\n- Learn about local **customs** and **traditions** to avoid unintentionally offending someone.\n- Use **formal language** when speaking to older people or people in positions of authority.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a **translation app** such as Google Translate to help with language barriers.\n- Carry a **phrasebook** or **dictionary** to help with basic communication.\n- Take a **Spanish language course** before traveling to Honduras to improve your language skills.\n- Use **online resources** such as language learning websites or YouTube channels to learn more about Honduran culture and language.\n- Hire a **local guide** or **interpreter** if you need help with complex communication or navigation.",
