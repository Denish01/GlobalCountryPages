[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Honduras is a mixed model, combining public and private providers. The public system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which operates a network of hospitals and clinics throughout the country. However, the public system is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private system is generally better equipped and staffed, but it can be expensive and is often out of reach for many Hondurans. Urban areas, such as Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, tend to have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often have limited options.

The quality of care in Honduras can vary significantly depending on the facility and the location. Some private hospitals and clinics in urban areas offer high-quality care, while public facilities and those in rural areas may have more limited resources and less experienced staff. Additionally, the country faces challenges related to **infectious diseases**, such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus, which can be a concern for travelers and residents alike.

Despite these challenges, Honduras has made progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including increasing access to healthcare services and reducing child mortality rates. However, more work is needed to address the systemic issues and ensure that all Hondurans have access to quality healthcare.
