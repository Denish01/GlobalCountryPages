[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Honduras is generally reliable, with average speeds of 10 Mbps download, although this can vary greatly depending on the location. Urban areas such as Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula tend to have better internet quality and coverage compared to rural areas, where speeds can be significantly slower and more prone to outages. The country's internet infrastructure is still developing, and as a result, users may experience occasional disruptions and slow speeds, especially during peak hours.

In terms of reliability, the internet in Honduras is relatively stable, with most carriers offering 24/7 coverage in major cities. However, power outages and natural disasters can affect internet connectivity, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the country's internet penetration rate is around 30%, which means that many areas, especially rural ones, still lack access to reliable internet services. Despite these challenges, the government and private sector are working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber-optic cables and mobile networks.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Honduras, you can visit one of the main carriers' stores, such as Claro, Tigo, or Hondutel, and provide a valid passport and proof of address. The process is relatively straightforward, and you can expect to pay around 10 USD for a tourist SIM card. Most carriers offer prepaid plans with data, voice, and text services, and you can recharge your account at various retail outlets throughout the country. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as this will ensure better coverage and reliability.
