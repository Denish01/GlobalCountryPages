[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Honduras is divided into public and private institutions, with public schools being generally free or low-cost, but often lacking in resources and quality. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction in Honduras is **Spanish**, and compulsory education lasts for 11 years, from primary to upper secondary level. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **American** programs.

The quality of education in Honduras is a concern, with many public schools facing challenges such as limited resources, outdated curricula, and inadequate teacher training. Private schools, on the other hand, often have better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum. However, these schools are not accessible to many Hondurans, due to the high cost of tuition. International schools offer a high-quality education, but are often very expensive and cater mainly to expatriate families and wealthy locals.
