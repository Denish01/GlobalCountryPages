[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Honduras has a relatively affordable housing market compared to its regional neighbors. The rental market is largely driven by demand from students, young professionals, and expatriates, with typical lease terms ranging from 6-12 months. Deposit requirements are usually equivalent to one or two months' rent, and tenants have some rights under Honduran law, including protection from eviction without due process. However, the housing market can be competitive, especially in popular areas, and tenants may need to act quickly to secure a property.

In comparison to its neighbors, Honduras has a more affordable housing market than Costa Rica or Panama, but slightly more expensive than Guatemala or Nicaragua. The country's housing market is also influenced by the **tourism industry**, with many rentals available in coastal areas and tourist hotspots. However, outside of these areas, housing prices and rents can be significantly lower. Overall, Honduras offers a range of affordable housing options, from apartments to houses, making it an attractive destination for expatriates and investors.
