  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Honduras can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $100 to $200 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($150 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($40 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($15 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: HNL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nHonduras has a relatively developed utility infrastructure, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having more reliable access to utilities than rural areas. The cost of utilities in Honduras can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity and water during the dry season (December to May) leading to increased prices. Additionally, the country's inflation rate of 4.6% (2024) can also impact the cost of utilities, making it essential for consumers to regularly review their usage and adjust their budgets accordingly.\n\nThe Honduran government has implemented measures to stabilize the cost of utilities, including subsidies for low-income households and investments in renewable energy sources. However, the cost of utilities can still be a significant burden for many households, particularly those with limited incomes. As a result, it is essential for consumers to be mindful of their energy and water usage and take steps to reduce their consumption, such as using energy-efficient appliances and conserving water.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane or natural gas) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (separate fee) |\n| **Total** | **$75** | **$120** | **$175** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Tigo, Claro |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 50-100 Mbps | Tigo, Claro |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Tigo, Claro, Hondutel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-20 GB | Tigo, Claro, Hondutel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Tigo, Claro |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Claro Video) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Honduras, it is recommended to contact the relevant providers (e.g. Tigo, Claro, Hondutel) and provide proof of address and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a cost-effective option for households with variable incomes, as they allow consumers to pay for their energy usage in advance.\n- The best internet providers in Honduras include Tigo and Claro, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different budgets and needs.\n- To save on utility bills, consumers can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and adjusting their thermostat to reduce their energy consumption.\n- It is also recommended to regularly review and adjust your utility plans to ensure you are getting the best value for your money.",
