  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Honduras varies significantly between public and private providers, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for over 50% of total healthcare spending, and insurance costs ranging from $50 to $500 per month.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $249 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 53.1% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 195\nInsurance Required: No\nCurrency: HNL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nHonduras has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and long wait times, while private hospitals and clinics offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those with the means to afford it tend to opt for private care. Insurance is not required, but it is highly recommended, especially for those who plan to use private healthcare services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Honduras is not universal, and many people, especially in rural areas, lack access to basic healthcare services. The government has implemented various programs to improve healthcare access, but the system remains underfunded and understaffed. For foreigners, it is essential to have insurance that covers medical evacuation, as the quality of care in Honduras may not be up to international standards. Additionally, many private hospitals and clinics require payment upfront, so it is crucial to have a means of paying for medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by dentist and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Prices vary by optometrist and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Prices vary by lab and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Prices vary by type of surgery and surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers more extensive medical expenses, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Covers medical expenses, including evacuation and repatriation, and provides access to international healthcare network |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary widely, with some medications costing as little as $5 and others costing over $50\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but prices can be higher than in other countries\n- Pharmacies are common in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a local doctor, while others can be purchased over-the-counter\n- Prices for common medications such as antibiotics and pain relievers range from $10 to $30\n- It is essential to check the expiration date and authenticity of medications before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 195, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not be equipped with the latest medical technology. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek medical attention at a private hospital, such as the Hospital CEMESA in Tegucigalpa or the Hospital San Jorge in San Pedro Sula. These hospitals have a reputation for providing high-quality care and have experience treating international patients.\n\nIt is also essential to have a means of paying for medical expenses, as many hospitals and clinics require payment upfront. Additionally, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical evacuation, as the quality of care in Honduras may not be up to international standards. In the event of a serious medical emergency, it may be necessary to evacuate to a nearby country, such as Costa Rica or Panama, for further treatment. It is crucial to research and prepare for any medical emergency before traveling to Honduras, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency.",
