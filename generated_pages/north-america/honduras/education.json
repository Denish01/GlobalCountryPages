  "content": "The education system in Honduras is a mixed model that includes both public and private institutions, with a strong emphasis on primary and secondary education, and a growing number of universities and international schools. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 89%\nSchool System: 6 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Spanish\nAcademic Calendar: 10 months\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 5 in Central America\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Honduras is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **basic education**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, and is provided free of charge by the government. Secondary education, which includes **middle school** and **high school**, is also free, but not compulsory, and is typically attended by students between the ages of 13 and 18. Tertiary education, which includes **universities** and **technical schools**, is not free, but is becoming increasingly popular among Honduran students. The quality of education in Honduras varies greatly between public and private institutions, with private schools generally considered to be of higher quality.\n\nThe public education system in Honduras faces several challenges, including a lack of resources, outdated curricula, and a shortage of qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools in Honduras are generally well-equipped and offer a more modern and rigorous education. However, these schools are often expensive, and are therefore not accessible to many Honduran families. Despite these challenges, the Honduran government has made significant efforts in recent years to improve the quality and accessibility of education, including the implementation of new curricula and the construction of new schools.\n\nIn addition to public and private schools, Honduras is also home to a growing number of **bilingual schools**, which offer instruction in both Spanish and English. These schools are becoming increasingly popular among Honduran families who want their children to have a competitive edge in the global economy. Overall, the education system in Honduras is complex and multifaceted, and offers a range of options for students of all backgrounds and interests.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
