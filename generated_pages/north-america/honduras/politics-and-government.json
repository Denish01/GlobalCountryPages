The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a four-year term and is limited to two terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Congress, which has 128 members elected by proportional representation for four-year terms. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court of Justice, which has 15 members appointed by the National Congress for seven-year terms.\n\nThe separation of powers in Honduras is designed to provide checks and balances among the branches, ensuring that no one branch has too much power. The President has the power to appoint ministers and other high-ranking officials, but the National Congress must approve these appointments. The National Congress has the power to pass laws, but the President can veto them. The Supreme Court of Justice has the power to interpret laws and declare them unconstitutional.\n\nHonduras has a **unitary system**, where the central government has the primary authority to make decisions and policies. The country is divided into 18 departments, which are further divided into municipalities. While the departments and municipalities have some autonomy, the central government still maintains significant control over them.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Xiomara Castro | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Cabinet | Ministers appointed by the President | Advisory and administrative roles |\n| Legislative | National Congress | President of the National Congress | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Justice | President of the Supreme Court of Justice | Judicial review and interpretation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Liberty and Refoundation (LIBRE) | Left-wing | Xiomara Castro | 51 | Social democratic and progressive platform |\n| National Party of Honduras (PNH) | Right-wing | Juan Orlando Hernandez | 44 | Conservative and free market-oriented platform |\n| Liberal Party of Honduras (PLH) | Center-left | Luis Zelaya | 22 | Social liberal and democratic platform |\n| Christian Democratic Party of Honduras (PDCH) | Center-right | Marco Antonio Andino | 10 | Christian democratic and social conservative platform |\n| Anti-Corruption Party (PAC) | Center | Salvador Nasralla | 4 | Anti-corruption and social justice platform |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Honduras is based on proportional representation, where voters elect representatives to the National Congress and the President through direct elections.\n- Elections are held every four years, with the most recent presidential election taking place in 2021.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled for 2025.\n- Voter participation in Honduras is relatively high, with around 60% of eligible voters participating in the 2021 presidential election.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Honduras is marked by **polarization** and **instability**, with high levels of crime and corruption.\n- Key issues facing the country include poverty, inequality, and lack of access to basic services such as healthcare and education.\n- Regional dynamics, such as the influence of neighboring countries and the impact of **migration** and **trade**, also play a significant role in Honduras' political stability.\n- According to the 2022 Freedom in the World report, Honduras has a **partly free** status, with significant limitations on civil liberties and political rights.\n- The country also faces challenges related to **climate change**, including deforestation, soil erosion, and natural disasters.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Honduras is a member of several international organizations, including the **United Nations**, the **Organization of American States**, and the **Central American Integration System**.\n- The country has a **strategic partnership** with the United States, which provides significant economic and military aid.\n- Honduras also has close relations with other Central American countries, particularly **Guatemala**, **El Salvador**, and **Nicaragua**, with which it shares a border.\n- The country is a signatory to several international agreements, including the **Central American Free Trade Agreement** and the **Association Agreement with the European Union**.\n- Honduras has a **diplomatic stance** that prioritizes regional cooperation, economic development, and human rights, while also seeking to maintain good relations with its neighbors and international partners.",
