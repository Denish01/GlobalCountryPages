[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Honduras has a lower-middle-income economy, with a mix of industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. The country has experienced steady economic growth, with a GDP growth rate averaging around 3.5% per year over the past decade. However, Honduras still faces significant development challenges, including high levels of poverty and inequality. The economy is heavily dependent on exports, particularly of **coffee**, **bananas**, and **textiles**, which are vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. The country has also made efforts to diversify its economy, with a growing focus on **tourism** and **manufacturing**.

The Honduran economy has been driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment, as well as remittances from abroad. The country has a large diaspora community, with many Hondurans living and working in the United States, who send back significant amounts of money to support their families. This has helped to boost economic growth and reduce poverty. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including high levels of crime and corruption, which can deter investment and hinder economic development.

Despite these challenges, Honduras has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing a range of economic reforms aimed at improving the business environment and promoting investment. The country has also made efforts to improve its infrastructure, including the development of new transportation networks and energy systems. Overall, the Honduran economy has the potential for significant growth and development, but will require continued investment and reform efforts to achieve its full potential.
