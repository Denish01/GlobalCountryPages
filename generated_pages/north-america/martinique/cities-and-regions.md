[SECTION] How Martinique Is Divided [/SECTION]
Martinique is an overseas department of France, and as such, it is divided into four arrondissements, which are further divided into 45 communes. The arrondissements are Fort-de-France, Le Marin, Saint-Pierre, and Trinité, each with its own administrative center and unique character. The arrondissements are responsible for providing various public services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, to the local population. The communes, on the other hand, have a degree of autonomy and are responsible for managing local affairs, such as urban planning, waste management, and cultural events.

The administrative structure of Martinique is designed to provide a high level of decentralization and autonomy to the local authorities, while still maintaining a strong link with the French government. This structure has allowed Martinique to develop a unique cultural and economic identity, while still benefiting from the support and resources of the French state.
