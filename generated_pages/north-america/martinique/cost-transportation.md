[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Martinique has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with a range of options available for getting around the island. The most common modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and rental cars, with many residents also opting to use their own vehicles. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting the main towns and cities, including the capital Fort-de-France. However, the availability of public transportation can be limited in rural areas, making it more difficult to get around without a car.

The majority of people in Martinique get around by car, either by owning their own vehicle or by renting one for the duration of their stay. This is due in part to the limited public transportation options in rural areas, as well as the fact that many of the island's attractions are located outside of the main towns and cities. However, for those who do not have access to a car, there are still plenty of options available, including buses and taxis, which can be a convenient and affordable way to get around.
