The public healthcare system in Martinique is generally of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, and a wide range of medical specialties available. However, the public system can be slow, and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, are more expensive, but offer faster access to medical care and a wider range of specialized services. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of medical care, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare services, which may be more familiar and convenient for them.\n\nThe healthcare system in Martinique is overseen by the French government, and the island's medical facilities and personnel are subject to French standards and regulations. This means that the quality of medical care in Martinique is generally high, and medical facilities are well-equipped and modern. However, the cost of medical care can be high, especially for foreigners who do not have health insurance. It is highly recommended that visitors to Martinique have health insurance that covers them for medical emergencies, as well as any pre-existing medical conditions they may have.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $25-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$60 | $60-$120 | |\n| Eye Exam | $40-$80 | $80-$150 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$40 | $40-$80 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$2,500 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, advanced medical procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Worldwide coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be expensive, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and relatively affordable, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 per item\n- Pharmacies are plentiful in Martinique, especially in urban areas\n- Prescription rules are strictly enforced, and visitors should bring a copy of their prescription with them when traveling to Martinique\n- Some medications may not be available in Martinique, so visitors should plan ahead and bring any necessary medication with them\n- Pharmacy hours can vary, but most are open from 9am to 7pm, Monday to Saturday\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, visitors to Martinique should call the emergency number, 15, which is available 24/7.
