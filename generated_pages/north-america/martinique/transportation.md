[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Martinique is easily accessible by air, with the Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport (FDF) serving as the main entry point for international visitors. The airport is located in Le Lamentin, about 8 kilometers from the capital city of Fort-de-France. Direct flights are available from major hubs such as Paris, Miami, and Montreal, as well as from neighboring islands like Guadeloupe and Saint Lucia. If you're traveling from within the Caribbean, you can also take a ferry from nearby islands like Dominica or Saint Lucia, although this option may take longer and be less frequent.

For those traveling from Europe or North America, flying is the most convenient option, with airlines like Air France, American Airlines, and Air Canada offering regular flights to Martinique. Overland entry points are limited, as Martinique is an island, but you can take a ferry from nearby islands or arrive by private boat or yacht. It's worth noting that Martinique is a French territory, and as such, visitors from certain countries may require a visa or other documentation to enter the island.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights within Martinique are limited, as the island is relatively small and most destinations can be reached by car or bus. However, if you need to travel to a more remote area or prefer to fly, you can use a local airline like Air Caraibes or Take Air. These airlines offer flights from the international airport in Fort-de-France to smaller airports on the island, such as the one in Le Marin. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs can range from $50 to $200 per person, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in Martinique, so train travel is not an option. However, the island's good road quality and extensive bus network make it easy to get around without a car. If you prefer to take a guided tour, many companies offer bus excursions to popular destinations around the island.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus companies like **SODEXAM** and **TCM** operate on Martinique, offering frequent services between major towns and cities. The buses are generally comfortable and affordable, with fares ranging from $2 to $10 per person, depending on the route. You can pay the driver in cash when you board, and it's a good idea to have some small bills and coins handy. The buses usually run on a regular schedule, but it's always a good idea to check in advance to confirm the times and routes.
