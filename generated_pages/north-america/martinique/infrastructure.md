[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Martinique's infrastructure is characterized by a high level of development, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the quality of life for its residents. The territory has a well-developed road network, a reliable electricity supply, and access to modern telecommunications services. However, there are still some challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas where access to certain services can be limited. The French government, as the parent authority, has been actively involved in supporting the development of Martinique's infrastructure, with a focus on promoting economic growth and social welfare.

The urban-rural gap is a significant issue in Martinique, with the capital city Fort-de-France and other urban areas generally having better access to infrastructure services than rural areas. This disparity can make it difficult for people living in rural areas to access basic services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. To address this issue, the government has implemented various initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life in rural areas, including the development of new roads, the expansion of telecommunications services, and the provision of support for local businesses and communities.

Despite these challenges, Martinique's infrastructure is generally well-maintained and efficient, with a strong focus on providing high-quality services to residents and visitors. The territory's strategic location in the Caribbean also makes it an important hub for regional trade and commerce, with a well-developed port system and a growing tourism industry.
