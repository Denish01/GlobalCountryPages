The most common modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and rental cars, with many residents also opting to use their own vehicles. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting the main towns and cities, including the capital Fort-de-France. However, the availability of public transportation can be limited in rural areas, making it more difficult to get around without a car.\n\nThe majority of people in Martinique get around by car, either by owning their own vehicle or by renting one for the duration of their stay. This is due in part to the limited public transportation options in rural areas, as well as the fact that many of the island's attractions are located outside of the main towns and cities. However, for those who do not have access to a car, there are still plenty of options available, including buses and taxis, which can be a convenient and affordable way to get around.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1.50 | $45 | Good coverage of main towns and cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2.50 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.50 | $1.50 | $10-$15 | Available throughout the island |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.50 | $1.25 | $8-$12 | Uber and Kapo available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.25 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in city center |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, no toll roads on the island |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mainly between main towns and cities |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available, no domestic flights within Martinique |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available, no train network on the island |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass, which can provide unlimited travel on buses and other public transportation services.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber and Kapo to get around, as they can often be cheaper than traditional taxis.\n- Be sure to negotiate the fare with your taxi driver before you start your journey, as some drivers may not use the meter.\n- Consider renting a car for the duration of your stay, as this can provide the most flexibility and freedom to explore the island.\n- Be aware of the limited parking options in the city center, and plan your itinerary accordingly.\n- Use the Kapo app to book a minibus or shared taxi, which can be a convenient and affordable way to get around, especially in rural areas.",
