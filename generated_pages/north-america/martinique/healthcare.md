[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Martinique is based on the French model, with a strong emphasis on public healthcare and social security. The system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and social security contributions. The quality of care is high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. In urban areas, such as Fort-de-France, there are many public and private hospitals, clinics, and medical centers, offering a wide range of services, including specialized care. However, in rural areas, access to medical facilities may be more limited, and patients may need to travel to larger towns or cities for specialized care.

The public healthcare system in Martinique provides comprehensive coverage for all residents, including expatriates, with a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and diagnostic tests. Private healthcare is also available, with many private clinics and hospitals offering high-quality care, often with shorter wait times and more personalized attention. In general, the quality of care in Martinique is on par with that in France, with many medical professionals trained in France and speaking French as their primary language.

Overall, the healthcare system in Martinique is well-organized and provides easy access to medical facilities, especially in urban areas. However, it is still important for visitors and expatriates to have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high, and some services may not be covered by the public healthcare system.
