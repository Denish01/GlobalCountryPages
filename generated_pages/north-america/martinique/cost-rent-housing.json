Typical lease terms are 3-6 months for short-term rentals and 1-2 years for long-term rentals. Deposit requirements usually range from one to three months' rent, and tenant rights are protected by French law, which applies in Martinique as an overseas department of France. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Dominica and Saint Lucia, Martinique's housing costs are relatively high, but the island's unique blend of French and Caribbean culture, as well as its stunning natural beauty, make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists.\n\nThe housing market in Martinique is also influenced by the island's tourism industry, with many apartments and houses being rented out as vacation rentals. This can drive up prices, especially in popular areas such as Fort-de-France and the coastal towns. However, for those looking for a more affordable option, there are also apartments and houses available in the suburbs and rural areas. It's worth noting that the cost of living in Martinique is generally higher than in other Caribbean islands, due to its connection to France and the resulting importation of goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | 600-900 | 400-700 | compact, 1-2 rooms |\n| 1 Bedroom | 800-1,200 | 500-900 | 1-2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | 1,200-1,800 | 800-1,400 | family size, 2-3 bedrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | 1,800-2,500 | 1,200-2,000 | spacious, 3-4 bedrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | 3,500-5,000 | prime locations, sea views |\n| Suburbs | 2,500-4,000 | residential areas, amenities nearby |\n| Rural | 1,500-3,000 | countryside, ocean views |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Schoelcher**: a popular neighborhood in Fort-de-France, with a range of apartments and houses available, rent range $800-1,500 USD per month\n- **Fort-de-France city center**: a lively and convenient area, with many amenities and services nearby, rent range $1,000-2,000 USD per month\n- **Les Trois-Îlets**: a coastal town with a mix of modern and traditional apartments, rent range $600-1,200 USD per month\n- **Le Diamant**: a charming town on the west coast, with stunning ocean views, rent range $800-1,500 USD per month\n- **Le François**: a picturesque town on the east coast, with a range of apartments and houses available, rent range $500-1,000 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Martinique [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a rental property, as they can provide valuable insights and guidance\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market can be competitive, especially in popular areas\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment, as this can be more convenient and cost-effective, especially for short-term rentals\n- Be aware of additional costs, such as utilities and internet, which may not be included in the rent\n- [CALLOUT] Be cautious of scams, and always inspect the property thoroughly before signing a lease, to ensure that it meets your needs and expectations.",
