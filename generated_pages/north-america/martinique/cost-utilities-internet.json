The costs of utilities in Martinique are generally stable, with minimal fluctuations throughout the year.

The water supply is also subject to seasonal variation, with higher consumption during the dry summer months.\n\nThe overall quality of the utility infrastructure in Martinique is good, with a focus on sustainability and renewable energy. The island aims to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and increase its use of solar and wind power.
