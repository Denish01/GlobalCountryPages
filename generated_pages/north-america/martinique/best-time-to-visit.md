[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Martinique has a tropical **monsoon climate**, with two main seasons: a dry season and a wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity, moderate temperatures, and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit the island. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by high humidity, frequent rainfall, and a higher risk of **hurricanes** and tropical storms. The dry season is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, snorkeling, and exploring the island's beautiful beaches, while the wet season is better suited for indoor activities such as visiting museums and historical sites.

The climate in Martinique is also influenced by its **topography**, with the mountainous interior of the island experiencing a cooler and more temperate climate than the coastal areas. The eastern side of the island, which is exposed to the trade winds, tends to be cooler and more humid than the western side, which is more sheltered. Understanding the climate zones and seasons is essential for planning a trip to Martinique, as it can help you make the most of your time on the island and avoid any potential weather-related hazards.

The seasons in Martinique also have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season and the wet season being the low season. During the peak season, prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher, and popular attractions and beaches can be more crowded. In contrast, the low season offers a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, with lower prices and a greater sense of tranquility.
