The island's unique blend of flavors and ingredients has resulted in a distinct Creole cuisine, which is characterized by the use of spices, herbs, and fresh seafood. The cuisine is also shaped by the island's geography, with a focus on local ingredients such as **christophine** (a type of squash), **dasheen** (a type of taro), and **yams**. Regional variations can be seen in the different parts of the island, with the north being known for its **boudin créole** (a type of blood sausage) and the south being famous for its **fruits de mer** (seafood).\n\nThe French influence on Martinique's cuisine is evident in the use of ingredients such as **butter** and **garlic**, as well as the preparation of dishes such as **coq au vin** (chicken cooked in red wine). African influences can be seen in the use of spices and herbs such as **thyme** and **scotch bonnet peppers**, as well as the preparation of dishes such as **colombo** (a type of curry). The Caribbean influence is evident in the use of ingredients such as **coconut milk** and **plantains**, as well as the preparation of dishes such as **pepper pot soup**.\n\nMartinique's cuisine is also known for its street food and snacks, which are an integral part of the island's culture. **Accras de morue** (cod fritters) and **boudin créole** are popular street foods, and can be found at markets and food stalls throughout the island.
