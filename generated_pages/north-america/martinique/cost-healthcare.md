[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Martinique's healthcare system is a universal system, which provides access to medical care for all residents, including foreigners, who are required to have health insurance. The public healthcare system in Martinique is generally of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, and a wide range of medical specialties available. However, the public system can be slow, and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, are more expensive, but offer faster access to medical care and a wider range of specialized services. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of medical care, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare services, which may be more familiar and convenient for them.

The healthcare system in Martinique is overseen by the French government, and the island's medical facilities and personnel are subject to French standards and regulations. This means that the quality of medical care in Martinique is generally high, and medical facilities are well-equipped and modern. However, the cost of medical care can be high, especially for foreigners who do not have health insurance. It is highly recommended that visitors to Martinique have health insurance that covers them for medical emergencies, as well as any pre-existing medical conditions they may have.
