However, when it comes to cost of living, there are some significant differences between the two countries. The Bahamas has a more developed economy, with a stronger focus on tourism and financial services, which has led to a higher GDP per capita. On the other hand, Turks and Caicos has a smaller economy, with a greater reliance on tourism and fishing. As a result, the cost of living in the Bahamas is generally lower than in Turks and Caicos, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in determining the cost of living. The Bahamas has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on manufacturing, agriculture, and financial services, which has helped to keep costs down. In contrast, Turks and Caicos has a more limited economy, with a greater reliance on imports, which has driven up costs. Overall, the Bahamas offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Turks and Caicos has its own unique charm and attractions, and may be worth considering for those who are willing to pay a premium for a more exclusive and secluded experience.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bahamas (USD) | Turks and Caicos (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 900 | 1,200 | 25% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 2,500 | 3,500 | 29% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bahamas (USD) | Turks and Caicos (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 20 | 25% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 700 | 29% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 7 | 29% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 3 | 4 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bahamas (USD) | Turks and Caicos (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 70 | 29% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.50 | 20% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bahamas (USD) | Turks and Caicos (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 200 | 25% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 70 | 29% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Bahamas (USD) | Turks and Caicos (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 2,000 | 25% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 3,500 | 29% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 5,500 | 31% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Bahamas is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices that are 25-33% lower than in Turks and Caicos\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices that are 25% lower than in Turks and Caicos\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares that are 33% lower than in Turks and Caicos\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices that are 20-25% lower than in Turks and Caicos\n- **Turks and Caicos is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end luxury goods and services, which may be more readily available due to the country's focus on high-end tourism\n  - Exclusive and secluded experiences, such as private island rentals and luxury yacht charters\n  - Certain types of seafood and local cuisine, which may be more abundant and fresher in Turks and Caicos\n  - Eco-tourism and outdoor activities, such as snorkeling and diving, which may be more readily available in Turks and Caicos\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nThe Bahamas offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.
