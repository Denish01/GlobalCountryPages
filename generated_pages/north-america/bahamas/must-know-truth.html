        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The Bahamas, an archipelago of over 3,000 islands, has a rich and diverse history dating back to the indigenous Lucayan people. The first European to encounter the islands was <strong>Christopher Columbus</strong> in 1492, during his first voyage to the New World. The Spanish established the first European settlement in the Bahamas in 1513, but it was short-lived due to conflicts with the Lucayan people and the lack of gold and other valuable resources. In 1629, the British established the first permanent settlement on the island of Eleuthera, and in 1718, the Bahamas became a British colony. The British rule lasted for over two centuries, with the Bahamas serving as a strategic location for trade and naval operations.</p>
        <p>The Bahamas played a significant role in the <strong>American Revolutionary War</strong>, with the islands serving as a base for privateers and pirates. The British maintained control over the Bahamas until the <strong>American Civil War</strong>, when the islands became a haven for Confederate blockade runners. The Bahamas gained internal self-government in 1964 and achieved full independence from Britain on July 10, 1973. The country has since maintained a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> and a <strong>monarchy</strong>, with the British monarch serving as the head of state.</p>
        <p>The Bahamas has a complex and multifaceted history, with various cultural and economic influences shaping the country's development. The <strong>transatlantic slave trade</strong> had a significant impact on the Bahamas, with thousands of enslaved Africans brought to the islands to work on plantations. The legacy of slavery and colonialism continues to shape the country's identity and inform its relationships with other nations.</p>
        <p>The Bahamas' strategic location in the Caribbean has made it an important hub for trade and commerce. The country's economy has historically been driven by <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>fishing</strong>, and <strong>tourism</strong>, with a growing financial services sector in recent years. The Bahamas has also played a significant role in regional and international organizations, including the <strong>Caribbean Community</strong> and the <strong>United Nations</strong>.</p>
