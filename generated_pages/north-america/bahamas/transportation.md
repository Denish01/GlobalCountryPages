[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Bahamas has several international airports, with the main one being Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS) in Nassau, which receives direct flights from major hubs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. You can also fly into Freeport International Airport (FPO) on Grand Bahama Island, which has direct connections to Florida and other Caribbean islands. If you're coming from the United States, you can also take a ferry or a cruise ship to the Bahamas, with several companies offering services from ports in Florida.

For overland entry, the Bahamas has no shared land borders with any country, as it is an archipelago. However, you can take a ferry or a private boat to the Bahamas from nearby islands or from the United States. The main entry points for private boats are in Nassau and Freeport, where you'll need to clear customs and immigration. Be sure to research the requirements for entering the Bahamas by sea, including any necessary visas, permits, and customs forms.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The Bahamas has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights between the main islands. The main domestic airlines are Bahamasair and Southern Air, which operate flights between Nassau and other islands such as Eleuthera, Abaco, and Exuma. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way flight from Nassau to Eleuthera, for example, can cost around $100-$200. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best prices.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The Bahamas has no rail network, so you won't be able to take a train to get around the country. This is due to the country's geography, with many islands and a lack of landmass connectivity. As a result, other modes of transportation, such as domestic flights, buses, and ferries, are more commonly used.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
The Bahamas has a bus system that connects the main towns and cities on each island. The bus network is operated by the government and private companies, and fares are relatively affordable, with a one-way ticket costing around $1-$2. The buses are not always frequent, however, and the routes may be limited, so it's a good idea to plan ahead and research the schedules in advance. You can also take a coach or shuttle bus to get around, which may be more comfortable and convenient than the public bus system.
