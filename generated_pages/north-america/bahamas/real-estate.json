The market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by a stable economy, attractive tax regime, and proximity to the United States. The capital city, Nassau, and surrounding areas such as Paradise Island and Cable Beach are the most popular locations for real estate investment, with a wide range of properties available, from apartments and condos to single-family homes and **beachfront estates**. The market trend is expected to continue, with prices increasing steadily, particularly in urban areas.\n\nThe urban vs rural divide is significant in the Bahamas, with the majority of the population and economic activity concentrated in Nassau and surrounding areas.

The government has implemented initiatives to encourage development and investment in rural areas, including tax incentives and infrastructure upgrades.\n\nThe current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available and competitive pricing.
