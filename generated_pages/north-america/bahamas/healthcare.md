[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Bahamas' healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a relatively high standard of care, especially in urban areas like Nassau. The public healthcare system is managed by the Ministry of Health, which operates several hospitals and clinics throughout the country. However, many Bahamians and tourists alike prefer to use private healthcare facilities, which are often better equipped and staffed. The quality of care in the Bahamas is generally good, with many medical professionals trained in the United States or Europe. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be scarce.

Despite these limitations, the Bahamas has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on preventive care and public health initiatives. The country has also invested in modernizing its healthcare infrastructure, including the construction of new hospitals and clinics. As a result, the Bahamas is becoming an increasingly popular destination for medical tourism, with many foreigners traveling to the country for procedures such as cosmetic surgery and dental care.

The Bahamas' healthcare system is also supported by a number of international organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). These organizations provide technical assistance and funding to help the Bahamas improve its healthcare system and address key health challenges, such as HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases.
