The rental market is competitive, with many apartments and houses available for rent, particularly in the city center of Nassau. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Control Act**, which regulates rent increases and provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as the United States and Cuba, the Bahamas has a relatively high cost of housing, making it a challenging market for expats and locals alike.\n\nThe housing market in the Bahamas is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many properties being used as **vacation rentals** or **short-term lets**. This can drive up prices and reduce the availability of long-term rentals, particularly in popular areas such as the city center and coastal communities. However, for those who can afford it, the Bahamas offers a unique and desirable lifestyle, with a warm climate, beautiful beaches, and a vibrant culture.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $800-$1,200 | $600-$900 | (basic amenities, shared kitchen) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,800 | $800-$1,400 | (fully furnished, modern appliances) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,500-$2,500 | $1,200-$2,000 | (family size, 2 bathrooms) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | (spacious, luxury finishes) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $3,500-$6,000 | (prime locations, ocean views) |\n| Suburbs | $2,000-$4,000 | (residential areas, family-friendly) |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,500 | (acreage, countryside views) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Cable Beach: $1,500-$3,000 per month for a 2-bedroom apartment, known for its beautiful beaches and luxury resorts\n- Paradise Island: $2,000-$4,000 per month for a 3-bedroom house, popular with expats and tourists alike\n- Nassau Downtown: $1,000-$2,000 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, convenient for work and entertainment\n- Sandyport: $1,200-$2,500 per month for a 2-bedroom townhouse, a family-friendly community with amenities\n- Lyford Cay: $3,000-$6,000 per month for a 3-bedroom house, an exclusive gated community with luxury homes\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Bahamas [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices thoroughly before starting your housing search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find the best properties\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market can be competitive\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, if possible\n- Be aware of **scams** and **fraudulent listings**, and never send money without seeing the property in person\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and internet are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget",
