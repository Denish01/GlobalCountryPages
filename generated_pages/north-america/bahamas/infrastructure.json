  "content": "The infrastructure in Bahamas is well-developed, with a strong focus on tourism and international trade, featuring a mix of modern and aging facilities, including roads, airports, and ports, as well as reliable electricity and water supply systems.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 87%\nRoad Network: 2,700 km, paved and well-maintained\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Bahamas has a high level of infrastructure development, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the quality and capacity of its facilities. The country's strategic location in the Caribbean, with close proximity to the United States, has made it an attractive destination for tourists and businesses alike. However, there is still a noticeable gap between the infrastructure in urban and rural areas, with the capital city of Nassau and the surrounding islands having better access to modern amenities and services. The government has been working to address this disparity through various development projects and initiatives.\n\nThe Bahamas has a strong economy, driven primarily by tourism and financial services, which has enabled the country to invest in its infrastructure. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's transportation systems, including the expansion of the Lynden Pindling International Airport and the development of new port facilities. The government has also been working to improve the efficiency and reliability of its energy and water supply systems, with a focus on reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable practices.\n\nDespite these efforts, the Bahamas still faces challenges in maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure, particularly in the face of natural disasters such as hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to its facilities and systems. The country is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events, which will require significant investments in infrastructure resilience and adaptation measures.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 2,700 km | Good | Well-maintained, with some traffic congestion in urban areas |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in the Bahamas |\n| Airports | 3 international, 20 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, with some limitations in terms of capacity and services |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Facilities are aging, but still functional and well-maintained |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The Bahamas has a relatively reliable electricity supply system, with a mix of fossil fuel-based and renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power.\n- The country has set a target of generating 30% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, as part of its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development.\n- The electricity grid is well-developed, with a high level of access to electricity across the country, including in rural areas.\n- However, the Bahamas is still dependent on imported fossil fuels, which can be subject to price volatility and supply disruptions.\n- The government has been working to promote energy efficiency and conservation, through initiatives such as building codes and appliance standards.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- The Bahamas has a well-developed water supply system, with a high level of access to safe drinking water across the country.\n- The water supply is sourced from a combination of groundwater and desalination, with some wastewater reuse and recycling.\n- Sanitation coverage is also high, with most households having access to modern sewage systems and wastewater treatment facilities.\n- However, there are still some challenges in terms of water conservation and efficiency, particularly in the face of droughts and other climate-related stresses.\n- The government has been working to promote water conservation and efficient use, through initiatives such as water-saving appliances and public awareness campaigns.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- The Bahamas has a well-developed telecommunications sector, with a high level of access to mobile and fixed-line phone services, as well as internet and broadband.\n- Mobile coverage is widespread, with multiple operators providing services across the country.\n- The country has a relatively high level of internet penetration, with many households and businesses having access to high-speed internet services.\n- The government has been working to promote the development of the telecommunications sector, through initiatives such as spectrum allocation and licensing.\n- There are also plans to upgrade the country's telecommunications infrastructure, including the rollout of 5G services and the development of new data centers and cloud computing facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Bahamas is currently implementing a number of major infrastructure development projects, including the expansion of the Lynden Pindling International Airport and the development of new port facilities.\n- The government has also announced plans to invest in the country's energy and water supply systems, including the development of new renewable energy facilities and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.\n- The country is also working to improve its transportation systems, including the development of new roads and highways, and the upgrade of existing public transportation services.\n- The government has been working to promote private sector investment in infrastructure development, through initiatives such as public-private partnerships and concession agreements.\n- The country is also receiving support from international organizations and development partners, including the Inter-American Development Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank, to help finance and implement its infrastructure development plans.",
