[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The Bahamas has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with a high percentage of households having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the cost of utilities can be high, especially for electricity, which is largely generated from imported fossil fuels. The cost of utilities in the Bahamas can be stable, but it is subject to fluctuation due to changes in global energy prices. There is also a seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher costs during the summer months when air conditioning usage is higher.

The Bahamian government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, including the introduction of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient appliances. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for many households, especially low-income families. The high cost of utilities is also a challenge for businesses, particularly those in the tourism sector, which is a significant contributor to the country's economy.
