These districts are further grouped into several regions, each with its unique character and attractions. The country's administrative structure is relatively straightforward, with the capital city of Nassau serving as the center of government and commerce. The districts are responsible for providing local services and governance, while the central government handles national issues such as defense, foreign affairs, and economic development.\n\nThe Bahamas' administrative divisions are designed to promote local autonomy and community involvement, with each district having its own elected representatives and administrative offices. This system allows for a more responsive and effective governance structure, with decision-making power distributed among local leaders and the central government. The country's regional divisions also reflect its geographical diversity, with different districts and regions having distinct cultural, economic, and environmental characteristics.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Nassau** (266,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: colonial architecture, vibrant markets, and a rich history\nBest For: history buffs, culture enthusiasts, and shoppers\n\n**Freeport** (26,000)\nRole: economic hub, port city\nKnown For: industrial and commercial activities, duty-free shopping\nBest For: business travelers, shoppers, and those looking for a more laid-back atmosphere\n\n**Lucaya** (40,000)\nRole: tourist hub, cultural center\nKnown For: beautiful beaches, water sports, and a vibrant nightlife\nBest For: families, couples, and adventure seekers\n\n**Marsh Harbour** (5,000)\nRole: regional hub, economic center\nKnown For: fishing industry, boating, and a relaxed atmosphere\nBest For: outdoor enthusiasts, fishermen, and those looking for a quiet getaway\n\n**Dunmore Town** (1,500)\nRole: historic town, cultural center\nKnown For: colonial architecture, historic sites, and a charming atmosphere\nBest For: history enthusiasts, culture lovers, and those looking for a unique experience\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New Providence | urban, commercial | beaches, nightlife, shopping | Nassau |\n| Grand Bahama | industrial, tourist | duty-free shopping, outdoor activities | Freeport |\n| Abaco | rural, natural | fishing, boating, wildlife | Marsh Harbour |\n| Eleuthera | rural, historic | colonial architecture, historic sites | Dunmore Town |\n| Exuma | natural, tourist | beaches, water sports, wildlife | George Town |\n| Andros | rural, natural | fishing, boating, outdoor activities | Andros Town |\n| Long Island | rural, natural | beaches, fishing, boating | Clarence Town |\n| Cat Island | rural, historic | colonial architecture, historic sites | Arthur's Town |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The northern regions, such as Grand Bahama and Abaco, are more developed and tourist-oriented, with a focus on outdoor activities and water sports.\n- The central regions, such as New Providence and Eleuthera, are more urban and commercial, with a focus on shopping, nightlife, and cultural attractions.\n- The southern regions, such as Exuma and Long Island, are more rural and natural, with a focus on fishing, boating, and outdoor activities.\n- The eastern regions, such as Cat Island and San Salvador, are more historic and cultural, with a focus on colonial architecture, historic sites, and traditional practices.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nThe Bahamas has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, buses, and ferries connecting the different islands and regions.
