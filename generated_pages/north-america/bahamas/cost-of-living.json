[/SECTION]\nThe Bahamas is considered an expensive destination, with prices comparable to those in the United States. The country's strong tourism industry and limited local production contribute to the high cost of living. Compared to its neighbors, the Bahamas is more expensive than Cuba, but less expensive than some parts of the United States, such as Florida. Overall, visitors can expect to pay a premium for accommodations, food, and activities, especially in popular areas like Nassau and Paradise Island.\n\nThe high cost of living in the Bahamas is also driven by the country's reliance on imports, which can be subject to high tariffs and transportation costs. Additionally, the country's remote location and limited infrastructure can make it difficult to find affordable options for accommodations and transportation. However, with some planning and research, visitors can find ways to save money and enjoy their trip to the Bahamas without breaking the bank.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-80 | Basic rooms with shared facilities, often in guesthouses or small hotels |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $150-300 | Comfortable rooms with private bathrooms, amenities like pools and restaurants |\n| Luxury/Resort | $400-1000 | High-end amenities, private beaches, and upscale services |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $1000-3000 | City center: $1500-3000, outside: $800-2000 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-20 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-40 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $50-100 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-5 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-3 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-5 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-300 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 800 | 1500 | 3000 |\n| Food | 500 | 1000 | 2000 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 500 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 200 | 400 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 500 | 1000 |\n| **Total** | **1700** | **3400** | **6900** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting during the off-season (May-October) for lower prices on accommodations and flights.\n- Look for all-inclusive resorts, which can be a cost-effective option for meals and activities.\n- Eat at local eateries and street food stalls, which offer affordable and delicious options.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to save on taxi fares.\n- Take advantage of free activities like visiting the beach, exploring local markets, and attending cultural events.\n- Book accommodations and flights well in advance to secure the best prices.",
