However, the cost of utilities can be high, especially for electricity, which is largely generated from imported fossil fuels. The cost of utilities in the Bahamas can be stable, but it is subject to fluctuation due to changes in global energy prices. There is also a seasonal variation in utility costs, with higher costs during the summer months when air conditioning usage is higher.\n\nThe Bahamian government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, including the introduction of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient appliances. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for many households, especially low-income families. The high cost of utilities is also a challenge for businesses, particularly those in the tourism sector, which is a significant contributor to the country's economy.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $120 | $200 | $300 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | not commonly used |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in property tax |\n| **Total** | **$150** | **$245** | **$360** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $60-80 | 30 Mbps | BTC, Cable Bahamas |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 100 Mbps | BTC, Cable Bahamas |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $20-30 | 5 GB | BTC, Aliv |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $50-70 | 10 GB | BTC, Aliv |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $100-150 | varies | BTC, Cable Bahamas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $13 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $10 | Bahamas-based streaming services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents typically need to provide identification and proof of address to the service provider.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, which can help households budget their energy costs.\n- The best internet providers in the Bahamas are BTC and Cable Bahamas, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, households can use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transportation or walk/bike when possible.\n- Residents can also consider installing solar panels or other renewable energy systems to reduce their reliance on the grid and lower their energy costs.",
