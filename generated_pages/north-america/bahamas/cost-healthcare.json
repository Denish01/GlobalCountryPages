The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer wait times and limited resources. Locals often rely on the public system for basic care, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients typically required to pay out-of-pocket for services. While health insurance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe public healthcare system in the Bahamas is managed by the Ministry of Health, which operates a network of hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. These facilities provide a range of services, including primary care, specialist consultations, and emergency services. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific facility. In contrast, private healthcare facilities in the Bahamas are generally well-equipped and staffed by highly trained medical professionals. These facilities often have affiliations with international healthcare providers, making them a popular choice for foreigners and those seeking high-quality care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $150-$300 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$200 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic surgeries |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, advanced surgeries, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, emergency evacuations, maternity care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices ranging from $5-$20.\n- A doctor's prescription is required for most medications, although some pharmacies may offer basic diagnosis and treatment for minor conditions.\n- Pharmacy hours vary, but most are open from 9am-5pm, Monday-Friday.\n- Some pharmacies offer 24-hour services, especially in tourist areas.\n- Credit cards and cash are widely accepted at pharmacies, although some may not accept foreign currency.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial 919 to reach the local emergency services. Ambulances are available, but response times can vary depending on the location. The best hospitals for foreigners are typically private facilities, such as the Doctor's Hospital or the Princess Margaret Hospital, which offer high-quality care and have affiliations with international healthcare providers. These hospitals often have emergency departments and can provide a range of services, including surgery, intensive care, and diagnostic testing. It is recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations, as some procedures may require specialized care not available in the Bahamas. \nWhen seeking emergency care, it is essential to have a means of payment, as many facilities require upfront payment or proof of insurance before providing treatment. Additionally, some hospitals may have specific requirements or protocols for emergency patients, so it is crucial to be prepared and have all necessary documents and information readily available.",
