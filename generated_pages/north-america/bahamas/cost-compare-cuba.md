[SECTION] Overview: Bahamas vs Cuba [/SECTION]
The Bahamas and Cuba are two neighboring island nations in the Caribbean, each with its unique culture, history, and economic context. The Bahamas is a sovereign nation with a high-income economy, driven by tourism and financial services, whereas Cuba is a socialist state with a planned economy, heavily reliant on agriculture and remittances. The cost of living in the Bahamas is significantly higher than in Cuba, due to its strong economy, high standard of living, and proximity to the United States. In contrast, Cuba's economy has been struggling in recent years, resulting in a lower cost of living, but also limited access to goods and services.

The overall cost of living in the Bahamas is around 30-50% higher than in Cuba, making Cuba a more attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats. However, the Bahamas offers a more developed infrastructure, a wider range of amenities, and a higher standard of living, which may be worth the extra cost for some individuals. The difference in cost of living between the two countries is largely driven by the disparity in rent, food, and transportation costs. While the Bahamas is more expensive, Cuba's unique cultural experiences, stunning natural beauty, and rich history make it an attractive destination for those looking for a more authentic and affordable Caribbean experience.
