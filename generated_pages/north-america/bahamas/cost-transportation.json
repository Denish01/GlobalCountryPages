The most common modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and rental cars, with many residents and tourists also opting to walk or bike in the more populated areas. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services and a comprehensive network of routes, although it can be limited in some of the more rural areas.\n\nIn terms of getting around, most people in the Bahamas rely on private vehicles, with many residents owning cars due to the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system outside of the main towns. However, tourists often opt for taxis or shuttle services, which are readily available at the airports and major hotels. Additionally, many resorts and hotels offer their own transportation services, including shuttle buses and water taxis, making it easy to get around without a car.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1.50 | $90 | Comprehensive network of routes, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in the Bahamas |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly used for shorter journeys |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in the Bahamas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3 | $2 | $10-$20 | Available at airports and major hotels |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5 | $1.50 | $10-$25 | Uber and Lyft available in Nassau and Freeport |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, depending on the airport and destination |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Prices vary depending on the island and location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.30 | Prices vary depending on the island and location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$100 | Economy car, prices vary depending on the rental company and location |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in some areas, prices vary |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable in the Bahamas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Limited services, mostly used for shorter journeys |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$300 | Typical route, prices vary depending on the airline and destination |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in the Bahamas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or using ride-hailing apps instead of taxis.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure safety and avoid overcharging.\n- Always negotiate the fare before getting into a taxi, especially if you're traveling a long distance.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or when using public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for longer periods or for traveling to more rural areas, as public transportation options may be limited.\n- Use **traffic apps** like Waze or Google Maps to navigate the roads and avoid traffic congestion.",
