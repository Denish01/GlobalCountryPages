The Bahamas has a long and complex history, with the first inhabitants arriving around 1000 AD, when the **Lucayan** people, an indigenous tribe, settled on the islands.

In 1492, **Christopher Columbus** landed on the island of Guanahani, which he named San Salvador, and this event marked the beginning of European colonization in the Bahamas. The Spanish colonizers brought with them **slavery**, **disease**, and **violence**, which had a devastating impact on the Lucayan population, and by the mid-16th century, the Lucayans had largely disappeared.

In the 20th century, the Bahamas began to move towards **independence**, with the country gaining internal self-government in 1964 and full independence in 1973. The country has since developed a **tourism-based economy** and has become a popular destination for visitors from around the world.
