[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Bahamas has a high level of infrastructure development, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the quality and capacity of its facilities. The country's strategic location in the Caribbean, with close proximity to the United States, has made it an attractive destination for tourists and businesses alike. However, there is still a noticeable gap between the infrastructure in urban and rural areas, with the capital city of Nassau and the surrounding islands having better access to modern amenities and services. The government has been working to address this disparity through various development projects and initiatives.

The Bahamas has a strong economy, driven primarily by tourism and financial services, which has enabled the country to invest in its infrastructure. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's transportation systems, including the expansion of the Lynden Pindling International Airport and the development of new port facilities. The government has also been working to improve the efficiency and reliability of its energy and water supply systems, with a focus on reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable practices.

Despite these efforts, the Bahamas still faces challenges in maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure, particularly in the face of natural disasters such as hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to its facilities and systems. The country is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events, which will require significant investments in infrastructure resilience and adaptation measures.
