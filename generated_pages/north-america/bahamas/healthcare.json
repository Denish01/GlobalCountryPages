The public healthcare system is managed by the Ministry of Health, which operates several hospitals and clinics throughout the country. However, many Bahamians and tourists alike prefer to use private healthcare facilities, which are often better equipped and staffed. The quality of care in the Bahamas is generally good, with many medical professionals trained in the United States or Europe. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be scarce.\n\nDespite these limitations, the Bahamas has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on preventive care and public health initiatives. The country has also invested in modernizing its healthcare infrastructure, including the construction of new hospitals and clinics. As a result, the Bahamas is becoming an increasingly popular destination for medical tourism, with many foreigners traveling to the country for procedures such as cosmetic surgery and dental care.\n\nThe Bahamas' healthcare system is also supported by a number of international organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). These organizations provide technical assistance and funding to help the Bahamas improve its healthcare system and address key health challenges, such as HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Doctor's Hospital | Nassau | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Princess Margaret Hospital | Nassau | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Yes |\n| Rand Memorial Hospital | Freeport | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Bahamas Medical Center | Nassau | Private | Cosmetic surgery, dental care, physical therapy | Yes |\n| Lyford Cay Hospital | Nassau | Private | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Yes |\n| Marsh Harbour Medical Center | Marsh Harbour | Public | General medicine, emergency care | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expats, as it can help cover the cost of medical care in the event of an emergency.\n- The Bahamas has a number of local insurance options, including the **National Insurance Board**, which provides coverage for Bahamian citizens and residents.\n- **International health insurance** is also available, and can provide coverage for medical care in the Bahamas and other countries.\n- **Expats** should consider purchasing private health insurance that covers them in the Bahamas and other countries, as the cost of medical care can be high.\n- The cost of health insurance in the Bahamas can vary widely, depending on the type of coverage and the individual's age and health status.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors, as it can provide coverage for unexpected medical emergencies and other travel-related expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in the Bahamas, including many common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers.\n- **Pharmacies** are common in urban areas, and many are open late or 24 hours a day.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also widely available, including medications for common ailments such as colds and flu.\n- **Brand-name medications** are often more expensive than generic alternatives, but may be preferred by some individuals.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many medications require a prescription from a licensed physician.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** vaccination is recommended for all travelers to the Bahamas, as the disease is common in the country.\n- **Hepatitis B** vaccination is also recommended, especially for individuals who will be working in healthcare or having sex with multiple partners.\n- **Typhoid** vaccination is recommended for individuals who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for individuals who will be working with animals or spending time in rural areas.\n- **Insect-borne illnesses** such as dengue fever and Zika virus are present in the Bahamas, and travelers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in the Bahamas, and travelers should avoid drinking tap water or eating undercooked seafood.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- The Bahamas is becoming an increasingly popular destination for **medical tourism**, with many foreigners traveling to the country for procedures such as cosmetic surgery and dental care.\n- **Accredited hospitals** such as the Bahamas Medical Center and the Doctor's Hospital offer a range of medical services, including surgery, physical therapy, and rehabilitation.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists, as the cost of medical care in the Bahamas is often lower than in the United States or other developed countries.\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, dental care, and orthopedic surgery.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a **medical emergency**, travelers should call 911 or 919 for assistance.\n- **Ambulance service** is available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** should be identified in advance, and travelers should know how to get to them quickly and safely.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed promptly, and travelers should keep all receipts and documentation related to their medical care.\n- **Emergency evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, and travelers should consider purchasing travel insurance that covers emergency evacuation.",
