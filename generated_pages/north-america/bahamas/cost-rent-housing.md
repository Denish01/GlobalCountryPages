[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Bahamas has a relatively high cost of living, and the housing market is no exception. The rental market is competitive, with many apartments and houses available for rent, particularly in the city center of Nassau. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Control Act**, which regulates rent increases and provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors such as the United States and Cuba, the Bahamas has a relatively high cost of housing, making it a challenging market for expats and locals alike.

The housing market in the Bahamas is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many properties being used as **vacation rentals** or **short-term lets**. This can drive up prices and reduce the availability of long-term rentals, particularly in popular areas such as the city center and coastal communities. However, for those who can afford it, the Bahamas offers a unique and desirable lifestyle, with a warm climate, beautiful beaches, and a vibrant culture.
