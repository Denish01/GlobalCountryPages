[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Bahamas has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with the average internet speed now standing at 15 Mbps download. While this is not extremely fast, it is sufficient for most online activities, including browsing, social media, and streaming. However, there is a noticeable urban vs rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in cities like Nassau and Freeport, compared to more rural areas. In general, the internet in Bahamas is reliable, with most users experiencing minimal downtime and few connectivity issues.

Despite the improvements, the internet in Bahamas can still be affected by occasional outages and slowdowns, particularly during peak hours or in areas with high demand. Additionally, the lack of 5G connectivity may be a drawback for some users, especially those who require high-speed connections for work or other activities. However, for most tourists and casual users, the internet in Bahamas should be more than sufficient for their needs. The government has also been working to improve the country's digital infrastructure, with plans to expand fiber-optic networks and increase internet penetration in rural areas.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Bahamas is a relatively straightforward process, with several carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers, including Batelco, Aliv, and Cable Bahamas, have stores and kiosks located throughout the country, particularly in tourist areas. To purchase a SIM card, you will typically need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some carriers may have additional requirements. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 20 USD, and data plans start from around 10 USD per week for 1GB of data.

It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from one of the main carriers, as they offer the best coverage and speeds. Batelco and Aliv are particularly popular among tourists, as they offer a range of plans and promotions, including data-only and voice-and-data plans. It's also worth noting that some carriers offer prepaid plans, which can be a convenient option for short-term visitors.
