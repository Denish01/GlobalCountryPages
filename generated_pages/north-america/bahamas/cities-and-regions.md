[SECTION] How Bahamas Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Bahamas is an archipelago of over 3,000 islands, cays, and islets, with 31 districts that serve as the primary administrative divisions. These districts are further grouped into several regions, each with its unique character and attractions. The country's administrative structure is relatively straightforward, with the capital city of Nassau serving as the center of government and commerce. The districts are responsible for providing local services and governance, while the central government handles national issues such as defense, foreign affairs, and economic development.

The Bahamas' administrative divisions are designed to promote local autonomy and community involvement, with each district having its own elected representatives and administrative offices. This system allows for a more responsive and effective governance structure, with decision-making power distributed among local leaders and the central government. The country's regional divisions also reflect its geographical diversity, with different districts and regions having distinct cultural, economic, and environmental characteristics.
