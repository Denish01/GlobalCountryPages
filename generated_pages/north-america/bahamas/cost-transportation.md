[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Bahamas has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with a variety of options available to get around the islands. The most common modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and rental cars, with many residents and tourists also opting to walk or bike in the more populated areas. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services and a comprehensive network of routes, although it can be limited in some of the more rural areas.

In terms of getting around, most people in the Bahamas rely on private vehicles, with many residents owning cars due to the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system outside of the main towns. However, tourists often opt for taxis or shuttle services, which are readily available at the airports and major hotels. Additionally, many resorts and hotels offer their own transportation services, including shuttle buses and water taxis, making it easy to get around without a car.
