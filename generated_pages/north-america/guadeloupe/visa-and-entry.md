# Guadeloupe Visa & Entry Requirements

As a territory of France, Guadeloupe's visa requirements are generally aligned with those of France, and citizens of many countries do not need a visa to enter Guadeloupe for tourism or business stays of up to 90 days. 

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Guadeloupe before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Guadeloupe has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of around 100 countries eligible for visa-free access. This includes many countries in the European Union, as well as the United States, Canada, and Australia. The territory's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel and tourism with the need to maintain security and control over who enters the territory. Citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access will need to apply for a visa at the French embassy or consulate in their home country before traveling to Guadeloupe.

Guadeloupe's visa policy is also influenced by its membership in the Schengen Area, a group of European countries that have abolished border controls and adopted a common visa policy. As a result, citizens of countries that are eligible for visa-free access to the Schengen Area are also eligible for visa-free access to Guadeloupe. However, it's worth noting that Guadeloupe is not a member of the Schengen Area in the classical sense, and there may be some differences in the visa requirements and procedures.
