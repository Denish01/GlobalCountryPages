The costs of utilities in Guadeloupe are generally stable, but can fluctuate slightly depending on the season. During the summer months, electricity costs may be higher due to increased demand for air conditioning, while water costs may be lower during the rainy season. The **French** company, EDF, is the primary provider of electricity in Guadeloupe, and the water supply is managed by the local government.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Guadeloupe is also affected by the **Island's** remote location, which can make it more expensive to transport goods and services. However, the **French** government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of living in Guadeloupe, including subsidies for electricity and water. As a result, the cost of utilities in Guadeloupe is relatively comparable to other **French** territories in the Caribbean.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (mostly electric heating) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $25-35 | 10-20 Mbps | Orange, SFR |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 60-100 Mbps | Orange, SFR |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Digicel, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10-20 GB | Digicel, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Orange, SFR |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (Guadeloupe-specific content) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Guadeloupe, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as EDF for electricity and the local government for water.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans are more common and often offer better rates.\n- The best internet providers in Guadeloupe are Orange and SFR, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances and to take advantage of subsidies offered by the **French** government.\n- It is also recommended to monitor usage and adjust consumption habits to minimize waste and reduce costs.",
