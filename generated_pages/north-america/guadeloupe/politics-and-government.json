  "content": "Guadeloupe is governed as an overseas department and region of France, with a political system that reflects its status as a part of the French Republic.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Overseas department and region\nHead of State: President of France, currently Emmanuel Macron\nHead of Government: Prefect of Guadeloupe, currently Alexandre Rochatte\nLegislature: Guadeloupe Regional Council, 42 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: Guadeloupe's stability is closely tied to that of France, with a high level of stability due to its integration into the French system\nCorruption Index: Ranked 23rd out of 180 countries in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, reflecting a relatively low level of corruption\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe political system in Guadeloupe is based on the French model, with a **unitary** system of government. The island is an integral part of France, and as such, it is subject to the same laws and institutions as the rest of the country. The **separation of powers** is a key principle of the French system, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each playing a distinct role in the governance of the island. The **prefect**, who is appointed by the French government, serves as the representative of the state and is responsible for ensuring that the laws and policies of the French government are implemented in Guadeloupe.\n\nThe Guadeloupe Regional Council is the main deliberative assembly of the island, and it is composed of 42 members who are elected by universal suffrage for a term of six years. The council has a range of powers, including the ability to vote on the budget and to make decisions on matters such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The **executive** branch of the government is headed by the prefect, who is assisted by a number of deputy prefects and other officials. The **judicial** branch is composed of a range of courts, including the Court of Appeal and the Tribunal de Grande Instance.\n\nThe political system in Guadeloupe is designed to ensure that the island is integrated into the French system, while also allowing for a degree of autonomy and self-governance. This balance is reflected in the **decentralization** policies that have been implemented in recent years, which have given the island a greater degree of control over its own affairs. However, the island's status as an overseas department and region of France means that it is still subject to the authority of the French government, and that the French state retains a significant degree of control over key areas such as defense and foreign policy.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Prefecture of Guadeloupe | Prefect Alexandre Rochatte | Representative of the French state, responsible for implementing laws and policies |\n| Legislative | Guadeloupe Regional Council | President of the Regional Council, currently Ary Chalus | Deliberative assembly, responsible for voting on budget and making decisions on key areas such as education and healthcare |\n| Judicial | Court of Appeal of Basse-Terre | President of the Court of Appeal | Highest court in Guadeloupe, responsible for hearing appeals and ensuring that the law is applied correctly |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Socialist Party | Center-left | Ary Chalus | 12 | Supports greater autonomy for Guadeloupe, while maintaining close ties with France |\n| Union for a Popular Movement | Center-right | Laurent Bernier | 10 | Supports a strong relationship between Guadeloupe and France, with a focus on economic development |\n| Guadeloupe Communist Party | Left-wing | Jacques Gillot | 6 | Advocates for greater independence for Guadeloupe, and for a more equal relationship with France |\n| Guadeloupe Union | Center | Laurent Sainte-Rose | 8 | Supports a moderate approach to politics, with a focus on economic development and social justice |\n| Progressive Democratic Party | Center-left | Victorin Lurel | 6 | Supports a progressive approach to politics, with a focus on social justice and environmental protection |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Guadeloupe is based on universal suffrage, with all citizens over the age of 18 having the right to vote.\n- Elections are held every six years for the Guadeloupe Regional Council, with the most recent election taking place in 2021.\n- The next election is scheduled to take place in 2028, although the exact date has not yet been confirmed.\n- Voter participation in Guadeloupe is generally high, with turnout rates often exceeding 70%.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Guadeloupe is relatively stable, with a low level of **political violence** and a strong sense of **social cohesion**.\n- However, the island faces a number of challenges, including a high level of **unemployment** and a need for **infrastructure development**.\n- The island's **relationship with France** is also a key issue, with some residents advocating for greater autonomy or even independence.\n- The **economic situation** is a major concern, with a high level of **poverty** and a need for **economic diversification**.\n- The island is also vulnerable to **natural disasters**, such as hurricanes, which can have a significant impact on the economy and infrastructure.\n- In terms of **freedom indices**, Guadeloupe is ranked as a **free** territory by Freedom House, with a high level of **press freedom** and **academic freedom**.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Guadeloupe's foreign relations are largely managed by France, although the island has a degree of autonomy in areas such as **trade** and **tourism**.\n- The island is a member of a number of **international organizations**, including the **United Nations** and the **European Union**.\n- Guadeloupe has a **special relationship** with the **Caribbean Community** (CARICOM), and is an associate member of the organization.\n- The island also has a **cooperation agreement** with the **Organization of Eastern Caribbean States** (OECS), which aims to promote economic development and cooperation in the region.\n- In terms of **diplomatic stance**, Guadeloupe is generally aligned with the **foreign policy** of France, although the island has a degree of flexibility in areas such as **regional relations** and **development cooperation**.",
