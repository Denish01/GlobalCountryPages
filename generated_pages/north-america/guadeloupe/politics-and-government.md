[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The political system in Guadeloupe is based on the French model, with a **unitary** system of government. The island is an integral part of France, and as such, it is subject to the same laws and institutions as the rest of the country. The **separation of powers** is a key principle of the French system, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each playing a distinct role in the governance of the island. The **prefect**, who is appointed by the French government, serves as the representative of the state and is responsible for ensuring that the laws and policies of the French government are implemented in Guadeloupe.

The Guadeloupe Regional Council is the main deliberative assembly of the island, and it is composed of 42 members who are elected by universal suffrage for a term of six years. The council has a range of powers, including the ability to vote on the budget and to make decisions on matters such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The **executive** branch of the government is headed by the prefect, who is assisted by a number of deputy prefects and other officials. The **judicial** branch is composed of a range of courts, including the Court of Appeal and the Tribunal de Grande Instance.

The political system in Guadeloupe is designed to ensure that the island is integrated into the French system, while also allowing for a degree of autonomy and self-governance. This balance is reflected in the **decentralization** policies that have been implemented in recent years, which have given the island a greater degree of control over its own affairs. However, the island's status as an overseas department and region of France means that it is still subject to the authority of the French government, and that the French state retains a significant degree of control over key areas such as defense and foreign policy.
