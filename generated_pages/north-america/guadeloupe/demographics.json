The population growth rate is approximately 0.3%, which is relatively low compared to other Caribbean islands. The island's population is predominantly urban, with about 98% of the population living in urban areas. The population density is around 232 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high compared to other Caribbean territories. The median age is 38 years, and the life expectancy is around 78 years. Guadeloupe's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to a combination of natural increase and migration.\n\nThe population of Guadeloupe is characterized by a high level of urbanization, with the majority of the population living in the capital city of Basse-Terre and other urban areas. The island's urban population is attracted to the amenities and services available in these areas, including education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. However, the high level of urbanization also poses challenges, such as traffic congestion, housing shortages, and environmental degradation. The government of Guadeloupe has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges and promote sustainable development, including investments in public transportation, housing, and environmental protection.\n\nThe population of Guadeloupe is also characterized by a significant diaspora community, with many Guadeloupeans living and working abroad, particularly in France and other European countries. This diaspora community plays an important role in the island's economy, with many individuals sending remittances back to their families and friends in Guadeloupe. However, the diaspora community also poses challenges, such as brain drain and cultural disconnection, which can have negative impacts on the island's social and economic development.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Black or Afro-Caribbean | 80% | Island-wide | Descendants of African slaves |\n| White or European | 10% | Mainly in urban areas | Descendants of French colonizers |\n| Mixed or Mulatto | 5% | Urban and rural areas | Mixed African and European ancestry |\n| Asian or Indian | 3% | Mainly in urban areas | Immigrants from Asia and India |\n| Indigenous or Amerindian | 1% | Rural areas | Descendants of the original inhabitants of the island |\n| Other | 1% | Urban and rural areas | Includes people of other ethnicities, such as Lebanese and Syrian |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Guadeloupe are diverse and reflect the island's complex history and cultural heritage.
