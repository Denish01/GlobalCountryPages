The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and cities. Most people get around Guadeloupe by car, either by renting a vehicle or using taxis. The island's scenic roads and stunning scenery make driving a popular option, but public transportation is also a convenient and affordable way to explore the island.\n\nThe public bus network in Guadeloupe is operated by Karu'Lis, which provides frequent services to most parts of the island. Buses are a great way to get around, especially for shorter journeys, and are relatively inexpensive. Taxis are also widely available, but can be more expensive than buses.
