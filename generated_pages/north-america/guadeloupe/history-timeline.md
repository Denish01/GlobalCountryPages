# Guadeloupe History — Key Events & Timeline

Guadeloupe's history is a complex and multifaceted narrative that spans thousands of years, from the earliest indigenous inhabitants to the present day as an overseas department of France.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The island of Guadeloupe has been inhabited since the **Archaic Period**, around 3000 BC, with the earliest known inhabitants being the **Taino people**, an indigenous tribe that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years earlier. The Taino people developed a thriving society, with their own language, culture, and traditions. In 1493, **Christopher Columbus** arrived in Guadeloupe, marking the beginning of European exploration and colonization. The French established the first permanent settlement in 1635, and the island became a French colony, with the French imposing their language, culture, and customs on the indigenous population.

During the **Colonial Period**, Guadeloupe's economy was driven by the production of **sugar**, **coffee**, and **cotton**, with enslaved Africans being brought to the island to work on plantations. The **Transatlantic Slave Trade** had a profound impact on the island's demographics and culture, with the enslaved population eventually outnumbering the European colonizers. The French Revolution's emphasis on **liberty**, **equality**, and **fraternity** inspired a movement for **abolition** in Guadeloupe, with the enslaved population being freed in 1794.
