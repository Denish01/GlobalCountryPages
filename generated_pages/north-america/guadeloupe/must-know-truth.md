# The Truth About Guadeloupe - History & Real Facts

Guadeloupe is an overseas department and region of France, with a rich history and unique cultural identity that is often misunderstood by the general public. 

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Guadeloupe was first inhabited by the indigenous **Arawak** and **Carib** peoples, with the Arawak arriving around 300 AD and the Carib around 1000 AD. In 1493, Christopher Columbus landed on the island, and it was later colonized by the French in 1635. The French established the first permanent settlement on the island, and it became a French colony. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Guadeloupe's economy was largely based on **sugar production**, with African slaves being brought to the island to work on the plantations. In 1946, Guadeloupe became an overseas department of France, giving it a degree of autonomy while still being under French jurisdiction.
