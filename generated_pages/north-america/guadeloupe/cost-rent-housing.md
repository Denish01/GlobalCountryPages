[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Guadeloupe is relatively stable, with a mix of short-term and long-term rentals available. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under French law, which applies in Guadeloupe as a French territory. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda, Guadeloupe's housing costs are relatively moderate, although prices can vary depending on the location and quality of the accommodation. The housing market in Guadeloupe is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many landlords catering to short-term vacation rentals, which can drive up prices during peak season.

The housing market in Guadeloupe is characterized by a limited supply of affordable housing, particularly in the city center. However, there are efforts to develop new residential areas and renovate existing buildings to meet the growing demand for housing. Expats and foreigners can find a range of accommodation options, from apartments to houses, although prices may be higher than in some other Caribbean islands. It's essential to research and compare prices, as well as consider factors such as location, amenities, and transportation links when looking for a place to live in Guadeloupe.
