The public healthcare system is generally more affordable for locals and foreigners with insurance, while private healthcare services are more expensive but often offer more specialized care and shorter wait times. The system works similarly for locals and foreigners, with the main difference being that foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for services if they do not have insurance. It is recommended that visitors and expats have insurance to cover any medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Guadeloupe is funded by the French government and is free or low-cost for locals and foreigners with insurance. The system includes a network of public hospitals, clinics, and healthcare centers that provide a range of medical services, including emergency care, specialized care, and preventive care. Private healthcare services are also available, including private hospitals and clinics, and are often preferred by foreigners and those who can afford to pay out-of-pocket for services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$60 | $60-$120 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$60 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Specialist care, advanced procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and dosage.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and can cost between $5-$20 per item.\n- Pharmacies are readily available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas.\n- A prescription from a doctor is required for most medication, but some medication can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- The cost of medication can vary depending on the pharmacy and location.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial 15 to reach emergency services.
