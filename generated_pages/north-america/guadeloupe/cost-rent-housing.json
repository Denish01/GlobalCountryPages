Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under French law, which applies in Guadeloupe as a French territory. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda, Guadeloupe's housing costs are relatively moderate, although prices can vary depending on the location and quality of the accommodation. The housing market in Guadeloupe is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many landlords catering to short-term vacation rentals, which can drive up prices during peak season.\n\nThe housing market in Guadeloupe is characterized by a limited supply of affordable housing, particularly in the city center. However, there are efforts to develop new residential areas and renovate existing buildings to meet the growing demand for housing. Expats and foreigners can find a range of accommodation options, from apartments to houses, although prices may be higher than in some other Caribbean islands. It's essential to research and compare prices, as well as consider factors such as location, amenities, and transportation links when looking for a place to live in Guadeloupe.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | 500-800 | 350-600 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | 600-1,200 | 400-900 | standard, furnished or unfurnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | 900-1,800 | 600-1,400 | family size, amenities like balcony or garden |\n| 3 Bedroom | 1,200-2,500 | 800-2,000 | spacious, luxury amenities like pool or sea view |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | 3,000-5,000 | prime locations, historic buildings |\n| Suburbs | 2,000-3,500 | residential areas, modern amenities |\n| Rural | 1,500-2,500 | countryside, scenic views, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Basse-Terre**: the capital city, with a range of accommodation options, from apartments to houses, and a vibrant cultural scene, typical rent range $600-$1,200 USD per month\n- **Sainte-Rose**: a coastal town with a mix of modern and traditional housing, popular with expats, typical rent range $500-$1,000 USD per month\n- **Deshaies**: a picturesque fishing village, with a range of apartments and houses, popular with tourists and expats, typical rent range $400-$900 USD per month\n- **Le Gosier**: a bustling town with a mix of residential and commercial areas, typical rent range $500-$1,200 USD per month\n- **Terre-de-Bas**: a small island with a range of accommodation options, from apartments to houses, popular with expats and nature lovers, typical rent range $400-$1,000 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Guadeloupe [/SECTION]\n- Research and compare prices to find the best value for your budget\n- Consider working with a real estate agent or property manager to find a reliable landlord and a suitable property\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market can be competitive, especially during peak season\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, if possible, to get the best deal\n- Check the condition of the property and the amenities included, such as furniture, appliances, and utilities\n- Be aware of any additional costs, such as agency fees, security deposits, and utility bills, which may not be included in the rent.",
