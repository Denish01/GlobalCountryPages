Public schools in Guadeloupe are generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained teachers and adequate resources. However, some parents may prefer to send their children to private schools, which can offer smaller class sizes and more individualized attention. The language of instruction in Guadeloupe is French, although some schools may offer additional language courses in English or other languages. Compulsory education in Guadeloupe lasts for 10 years, from the age of 6 to 16, and is divided into primary and secondary education.\n\nThe education system in Guadeloupe is overseen by the French Ministry of Education, which ensures that schools in the territory follow the same curriculum and standards as schools in mainland France. This means that students in Guadeloupe can easily transfer to schools in France if they wish to pursue higher education or other opportunities. Additionally, there are several international schools in Guadeloupe that cater to the needs of expatriate families and offer curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the British GCSE.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, but may have large class sizes |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Smaller class sizes, more individualized attention |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Good quality education, with a range of extracurricular activities |\n| Private Secondary | $3,000-$7,000 | More specialized courses, better resources |\n| International School | $8,000-$10,000 | IB or GCSE curriculum, experienced international teachers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $200-$500 | $2,000-$5,000 | University of the French West Indies (UAG) |\n| Private University | $5,000-$10,000 | $8,000-$15,000 | Limited options, but some specialized courses |\n| Top-Ranked University | $8,000-$12,000 | $10,000-$18,000 | UAG, with some highly-rated programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Limited availability, especially outside of main towns |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $30-$75 | Experienced tutors available, especially for core subjects |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | French language courses widely available, some English courses |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100-$200 | Basic supplies, such as books and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for most schools, can be purchased locally |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The University of the French West Indies (UAG) is the top-ranked university in Guadeloupe, with a range of undergraduate and graduate programs.\n- Expatriate families may prefer to send their children to international schools, which offer a more familiar curriculum and teaching style.\n- Scholarship opportunities are limited, but some are available for local students who wish to pursue higher education in France or other countries.\n- Online learning options are becoming more widely available, especially for language courses and professional development.\n- The education system in Guadeloupe is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained teachers and good resources.\n- Parents should research schools carefully and consider factors such as class size, extracurricular activities, and support for students with special needs.",
