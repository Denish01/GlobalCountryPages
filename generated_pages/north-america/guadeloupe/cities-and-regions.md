[SECTION] How Guadeloupe Is Divided [/SECTION]
Guadeloupe is an overseas department of France, and as such, it is divided into two main departments: Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre. These departments are further subdivided into several communes, which are similar to municipalities or towns. The communes are responsible for providing local services such as waste management, transportation, and social services. The departments, on the other hand, are responsible for providing regional services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. This administrative structure allows for a balance between local autonomy and regional coordination.

The two departments of Guadeloupe have distinct characteristics, with Basse-Terre being more mountainous and rural, while Grande-Terre is flatter and more urbanized. This divide has led to different economic and cultural developments in each department, with Basse-Terre focusing more on agriculture and tourism, while Grande-Terre is more focused on industry and commerce. Despite these differences, both departments share a rich cultural heritage and a strong sense of identity as part of the Guadeloupean community.
