Guadeloupe's utility infrastructure is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. The costs of utilities in Guadeloupe are generally stable, but can fluctuate slightly depending on the season. During the summer months, electricity costs may be higher due to increased demand for air conditioning, while water costs may be lower during the rainy season. The **French** company, EDF, is the primary provider of electricity in Guadeloupe, and the water supply is managed by the local government.

The cost of utilities in Guadeloupe is also affected by the **Island's** remote location, which can make it more expensive to transport goods and services. However, the **French** government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of living in Guadeloupe, including subsidies for electricity and water. As a result, the cost of utilities in Guadeloupe is relatively comparable to other **French** territories in the Caribbean.
