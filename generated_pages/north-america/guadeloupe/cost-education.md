[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Guadeloupe is based on the French model, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. Public schools in Guadeloupe are generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained teachers and adequate resources. However, some parents may prefer to send their children to private schools, which can offer smaller class sizes and more individualized attention. The language of instruction in Guadeloupe is French, although some schools may offer additional language courses in English or other languages. Compulsory education in Guadeloupe lasts for 10 years, from the age of 6 to 16, and is divided into primary and secondary education.

The education system in Guadeloupe is overseen by the French Ministry of Education, which ensures that schools in the territory follow the same curriculum and standards as schools in mainland France. This means that students in Guadeloupe can easily transfer to schools in France if they wish to pursue higher education or other opportunities. Additionally, there are several international schools in Guadeloupe that cater to the needs of expatriate families and offer curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the British GCSE.
