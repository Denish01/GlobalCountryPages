The Haitian property market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional housing, with a growing demand for upscale properties in urban areas. The market has been steadily recovering since the 2010 earthquake, with prices increasing by around 10% annually. However, the market remains largely informal, with many transactions taking place outside of the formal sector. Urban areas such as Port-au-Prince and Pétion-Ville tend to have higher property prices compared to rural areas, where prices are generally lower. The **rental market** is also growing, driven by demand from expatriates and international organizations.

The Haitian government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including the creation of a **land registry** and the introduction of new laws to facilitate foreign investment. However, the market still faces challenges such as **bureaucratic hurdles** and **infrastructure constraints**. Despite these challenges, many investors see opportunities in the Haitian property market, particularly in the **tourism sector**, which is expected to drive growth in the coming years.
