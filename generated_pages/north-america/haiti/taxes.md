[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti has a **territorial taxation system**, meaning that only income earned within the country is subject to tax, regardless of the taxpayer's residency status. However, residents of Haiti are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must have a permanent home in Haiti, be present in the country for more than 183 days in a calendar year, or have their center of economic interests in the country.

The tax system in Haiti is overseen by the **Direction Générale des Impôts (DGI)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services. The DGI also offers incentives for businesses and individuals to invest in certain sectors, such as tourism and agriculture, and has implemented measures to improve tax compliance and reduce evasion.
