  "content": "Haiti is governed as a **unitary semi-presidential republic**, with a system that combines elements of presidential and parliamentary systems, where the president serves as head of state and the prime minister as head of government.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Semi-Presidential Republic\nHead of State: President (Ariel Henry, acting)\nHead of Government: Prime Minister (Ariel Henry, acting)\nLegislature: National Assembly, bicameral (Senate and Chamber of Deputies), 119 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 146 out of 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 164 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Haiti is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The president appoints the prime minister, who is the head of government and is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, which is a bicameral body made up of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The National Assembly is responsible for making laws and approving the government's budget. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are enforced fairly.\n\nThe system of government in Haiti is designed to provide a **separation of powers** between the three branches, with each branch having its own distinct powers and responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing the laws, the legislative branch is responsible for making the laws, and the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws. This separation of powers is intended to provide a system of checks and balances, which helps to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful.\n\nHaiti is a **unitary state**, meaning that the central government has authority over all aspects of government, including local governments. This means that the central government is responsible for providing services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure to all parts of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | Ariel Henry, acting | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Office of the Prime Minister | Ariel Henry, acting | Head of government |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Joseph Lambert, President of the Senate | Lawmaking and budget approval |\n| Legislative | Chamber of Deputies | Gary Bodeau, President of the Chamber of Deputies | Lawmaking and budget approval |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | René Sylvestre, President of the Supreme Court | Judicial review and interpretation of laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Haitian Tèt Kale Party (PHTK) | Center-right | Ann Valerie Timothee Milfort | 26 | Pro-government party |\n| Alternative League for Haitian Progress and Emancipation (LAPEH) | Left-wing | Joseph Evens Paul | 10 | Opposition party |\n| Pitit Desalin | Center-left | Jean-Charles Moïse | 8 | Opposition party |\n| Fanmi Lavalas | Left-wing | Jean-Bertrand Aristide | 6 | Opposition party |\n| Rassemblement des Patriotes Haïtiens (RPH) | Right-wing | Himmler Rébu | 4 | Opposition party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Haiti is based on a **mixed system**, with both proportional representation and single-member districts.\n- Elections are held every five years for the president and the National Assembly.\n- The last presidential election was held in 2016, and the next election is scheduled for 2025.\n- Voter participation in Haiti is generally low, with only about 20% of eligible voters participating in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Haiti is **volatile**, with ongoing protests and instability.\n- Key issues facing the country include **poverty**, **corruption**, and **inequality**.\n- Regional dynamics, including the influence of neighboring countries and international organizations, play a significant role in Haitian politics.\n- Haiti ranks low on various freedom indices, including the **Freedom House** index, which ranks the country as \"partly free\".\n- The country is also facing significant **humanitarian challenges**, including a lack of access to basic services such as healthcare and education.\n- The **security situation** in Haiti is also a major concern, with high levels of crime and violence.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Haiti is a member of various international organizations, including the **United Nations**, the **Organization of American States**, and the **Association of Caribbean States**.\n- The country has a **strategic partnership** with the United States, which provides significant economic and military aid.\n- Haiti also has close relations with other countries in the region, including the **Dominican Republic** and **Cuba**.\n- The country is a member of the **Caribbean Community** (CARICOM) and the **Central American Integration System** (SICA).\n- Haiti has a **diplomatic stance** that emphasizes **sovereignty** and **regional cooperation**.",
