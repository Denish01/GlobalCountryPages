The **inflation rate** of 26.9% in 2024 has also driven up prices, making it challenging for locals to afford basic necessities. Despite these challenges, eating out is a popular culture in Haiti, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a variety of traditional dishes. However, home cooking is still the norm, with many people relying on **local markets** to purchase fresh produce and other essentials.\n\nThe high cost of food in Haiti is also driven by the country's limited **agricultural production**, which forces the country to import many basic food items. This, combined with the high cost of transportation and storage, drives up prices and makes it difficult for locals to afford nutritious food. On the other hand, the country's **street food culture** offers a affordable and delicious alternative, with many vendors selling traditional dishes like **rice and beans**, **fried plantains**, and **grilled meat**.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2-$3 | 150-200 HTG | Imported from the US or Europe |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1-$2 | 50-100 HTG | Local production, may vary in quality |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-$3 | 100-150 HTG | Local production, may vary in quality |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 50-100 HTG | Imported from Asia or the US |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 250-350 HTG | Imported from the US or Brazil |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $8-$10 | 400-500 HTG | Imported from the US or Brazil |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 250-350 HTG | Imported from the US or Europe |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 100-150 HTG | Local production, may vary in quality |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 100-150 HTG | Local production, may vary in quality |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 50-100 HTG | Local production, may vary in quality |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 250-350 HTG | Local production, may vary in quality |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-$2 | 50-100 HTG | Local production, may vary in quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | Typical dishes like rice and beans, fried plantains, and grilled meat |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | One person, may include a drink and dessert |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$40 | Three courses, may include a drink and dessert |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | Upscale, may include a drink and dessert |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | May vary depending on location and brand |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | May vary depending on brand and location |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | May vary depending on location and brand |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | May vary depending on brand and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly between **supermarkets** and **local markets**.
