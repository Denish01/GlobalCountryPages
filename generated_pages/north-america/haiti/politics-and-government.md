[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Haiti is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The president appoints the prime minister, who is the head of government and is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, which is a bicameral body made up of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The National Assembly is responsible for making laws and approving the government's budget. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are enforced fairly.

The system of government in Haiti is designed to provide a **separation of powers** between the three branches, with each branch having its own distinct powers and responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing the laws, the legislative branch is responsible for making the laws, and the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws. This separation of powers is intended to provide a system of checks and balances, which helps to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful.

Haiti is a **unitary state**, meaning that the central government has authority over all aspects of government, including local governments. This means that the central government is responsible for providing services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure to all parts of the country.
