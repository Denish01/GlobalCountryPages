[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Haiti are generally higher than the regional average, mainly due to the country's reliance on imported goods and a lack of infrastructure to support local production. The **inflation rate** of 26.9% in 2024 has also driven up prices, making it challenging for locals to afford basic necessities. Despite these challenges, eating out is a popular culture in Haiti, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a variety of traditional dishes. However, home cooking is still the norm, with many people relying on **local markets** to purchase fresh produce and other essentials.

The high cost of food in Haiti is also driven by the country's limited **agricultural production**, which forces the country to import many basic food items. This, combined with the high cost of transportation and storage, drives up prices and makes it difficult for locals to afford nutritious food. On the other hand, the country's **street food culture** offers a affordable and delicious alternative, with many vendors selling traditional dishes like **rice and beans**, **fried plantains**, and **grilled meat**.
