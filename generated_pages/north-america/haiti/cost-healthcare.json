The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and long wait times. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. Having health insurance is recommended, as it can help cover the cost of medical care, especially in private facilities.\n\nThe healthcare system in Haiti is also heavily reliant on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international aid, which can provide essential services, particularly in rural areas. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the provider and the location. In general, medical facilities in urban areas, such as Port-au-Prince, tend to be better equipped and staffed than those in rural areas. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care at private facilities or clinics that cater specifically to expats and international patients.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$20 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private clinics may offer more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private dental clinics may offer more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Private optometrists may offer more comprehensive exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited resources |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Private clinics may offer more specialized surgical care |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$300 | Private maternity clinics may offer more comprehensive care |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Private imaging centers may offer more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $10-$20 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Specialist care, surgery, diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, comprehensive medical care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $5-$20 per month, depending on the type and brand\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and markets, with prices starting from $1-$5\n- Some pharmacies may offer generic or locally produced medication at lower costs\n- Prescription rules can vary, but generally, a doctor's prescription is required for most medication\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- It is recommended to check the expiration dates and authenticity of medication before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 115, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic. Ambulance services are limited, and it may be necessary to arrange for private transportation to a medical facility. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care at private facilities or clinics that cater specifically to expats and international patients. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Haiti include the **Hôpital Universitaire de la Paix** and the **Hôpital Bernard Mevs**, both located in Port-au-Prince. These hospitals offer modern facilities and equipment, as well as staff who speak English and other languages. However, even at these facilities, the cost of medical care can be high, and it is essential to have adequate health insurance coverage or access to funds to cover the cost of treatment.",
