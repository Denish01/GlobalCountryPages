[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Haiti is divided into public and private institutions, with a significant disparity in quality between the two. Public schools are generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in lower academic standards, while private schools offer better facilities, qualified teachers, and higher academic standards. The language of instruction in Haitian schools is primarily **Haitian Creole**, with **French** also being widely used, particularly in private schools. Compulsory education in Haiti lasts for 9 years, from the age of 6 to 15. International schools are available in major cities, offering curricula such as the **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**.

Despite the challenges faced by the education system in Haiti, there are efforts to improve the quality of education, particularly in the private sector. Some private schools have introduced innovative programs, such as **bilingual education** and **STEM education**, to prepare students for the global workforce. Additionally, there are several international organizations and NGOs working to support education in Haiti, providing resources and funding to improve educational infrastructure and teacher training.
