Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: October and November due to heavy rainfall and potential hurricanes. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nHaiti has a tropical climate with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by low humidity and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, with the most significant rainfall occurring in October and November. The country's climate is also influenced by its mountainous terrain, with the higher elevations experiencing cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the coastal areas.\n\nThe dry season is the best time to visit Haiti's beaches, go hiking, and explore the country's cultural and historical sites. The weather is generally sunny and dry, with average temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C). In contrast, the wet season can make travel more challenging, with heavy rainfall and potential flooding, especially in the coastal areas. However, the wet season is also a great time to see Haiti's lush vegetation and waterfalls, which are at their peak during this time.\n\nHaiti's climate zones vary by region, with the northern part of the country experiencing a slightly cooler and drier climate than the southern part. The mountainous regions, such as the Massif du Nord and the Chaîne des Matheux, have a cooler and more temperate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 50°F to 70°F (10°C to 21°C). The coastal areas, such as Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïten, have a hotter and more humid climate, with average temperatures ranging from 80°F to 100°F (27°C to 38°C).\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Sunny and dry | Low | $ | Beaches, hiking, cultural sites |\n| February | Sunny and dry | Low | $ | Carnival celebrations, outdoor activities |\n| March | Sunny and dry | Medium | $$ | Spring break, festivals, and events |\n| April | Sunny and dry | Medium | $$ | Easter celebrations, cultural events |\n| May | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Waterfalls, lush vegetation, and outdoor activities |\n| June | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Summer solstice, outdoor activities |\n| July | Hot and humid | Medium | $$ | Independence Day celebrations, cultural events |\n| August | Hot and humid | Medium | $$ | Summer festivals, and events |\n| September | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Back to school, and outdoor activities |\n| October | Heavy rainfall | Low | $ | Avoid due to heavy rainfall and potential hurricanes |\n| November | Heavy rainfall | Low | $ | Avoid due to heavy rainfall and potential hurricanes |\n| December | Sunny and dry | High | $$$ | Christmas and New Year's celebrations, peak tourist season |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Carnival | February/March | A colorful and vibrant celebration with music, dance, and costumes |\n| Independence Day | January | A celebration of Haiti's independence from France, with parades, music, and cultural events |\n| Easter | March/April | A significant holiday in Haiti, with church services, processions, and traditional foods |\n| Summer Solstice | June | A celebration of the summer solstice, with outdoor activities, and cultural events |\n| Fête Gede | November | A celebration of the voodoo spirit of death, with music, dance, and ceremonies |\n| Christmas and New Year's | December | A festive season with church services, parades, and traditional foods |\n| Festival du Rhum | October | A celebration of Haiti's rum production, with tastings, music, and cultural events |\n| Port-au-Prince International Jazz Festival | September | A festival featuring jazz music from around the world, with performances, and workshops |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The northern region of Haiti, including Cap-Haïten and the surrounding areas, has a slightly cooler and drier climate than the southern region.\n- The mountainous regions, such as the Massif du Nord and the Chaîne des Matheux, have a cooler and more temperate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 50°F to 70°F (10°C to 21°C).\n- The coastal areas, such as Port-au-Prince and Jacmel, have a hotter and more humid climate, with average temperatures ranging from 80°F to 100°F (27°C to 38°C).\n- The island of Île-à-Vache, located off the coast of Les Cayes, has a tropical climate, with average temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C).\n- The **Artibonite** region, located in the central part of the country, has a dry and sunny climate, making it ideal for agricultural activities.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the **shoulder season**, from May to June or September to November, when prices are lower and the weather is still pleasant.\n- Pack lightweight and breathable clothing, as well as waterproof gear, to prepare for the country's tropical climate.\n- Be aware of the potential for **hurricanes** and heavy rainfall during the wet season, and plan accordingly.\n- Avoid traveling during **Haitian holidays**, such as Independence Day and Carnival, when prices are higher and crowds are larger.\n- Learn some basic **Haitian Creole** phrases, such as \"bonjou\" (hello) and \"mèsi\" (thank you), to interact with locals and enhance your travel experience.",
