[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti's utility infrastructure is still developing, with many areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate significantly due to seasonal variation, with higher prices during the dry season (December to May) when water and electricity demand are higher. Additionally, the country's high inflation rate of 26.9% can lead to frequent price increases, making it challenging for residents to budget for their utility expenses.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Haiti is generally poor, with many households relying on alternative sources of energy, such as generators or solar panels, to supplement the unreliable public grid. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but progress has been slow, and many areas still lack access to basic services like electricity and clean water. As a result, utility costs can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited financial resources.
