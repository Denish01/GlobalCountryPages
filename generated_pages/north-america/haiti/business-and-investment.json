  "content": "Doing business in Haiti can be challenging due to its complex regulatory environment and infrastructure limitations, but the country also offers various investment opportunities in sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEase of Doing Business: 179 out of 190 (World Bank ranking context)\nCorporate Tax Rate: 30%\nFDI Inflow: $30 million annual\nSpecial Economic Zones: Yes, 2\nKey Industries: manufacturing, agriculture, construction\nCurrency Stability: Volatile\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]\nThe business environment in Haiti is characterized by a complex regulatory framework and a high level of bureaucracy. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the business climate, but more efforts are needed to simplify procedures and reduce corruption. Foreign investment is generally welcome, but investors often face challenges related to infrastructure, logistics, and security. The government has established several agencies to promote investment and provide support to businesses, including the Haitian Investment Promotion Agency (IHPA) and the Center for Facilitation of Investments (CFI).\n\nDespite the challenges, Haiti offers a strategic location for businesses looking to access the Caribbean and Latin American markets. The country has a young and relatively cheap workforce, with a significant portion of the population speaking French and Haitian Creole. However, the lack of infrastructure, including reliable electricity and transportation, can be a major obstacle for businesses. The government has launched several initiatives to improve the infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the port of Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe level of corruption in Haiti is a significant concern for businesses, with many companies reporting that they have to pay bribes to obtain licenses and permits. The government has taken steps to address corruption, including the establishment of an anti-corruption agency, but more efforts are needed to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\n[SECTION]
