  "content": "The education system in Haiti is a complex and challenging network that offers a range of opportunities for students, from primary education to higher learning, despite facing numerous obstacles and setbacks. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 61.7%\nSchool System: 9 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: French and Haitian Creole\nAcademic Calendar: October to June\nInternational Schools: limited\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 5,000 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Haiti is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 11, is typically provided by public or private schools. Secondary education, which lasts for 4 years, is also compulsory, but the quality and availability of schools vary greatly depending on the region and the type of institution. Tertiary education, which includes universities and other higher learning institutions, offers a range of programs and degrees, but the quality and recognition of these programs can be inconsistent. The education system in Haiti faces numerous challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers.\n\nThe quality of education in Haiti is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, desks, and qualified teachers. Public schools, which are free and open to all, often struggle with overcrowding and limited resources, while private schools, which are fee-based and often more prestigious, tend to offer higher quality education but are out of reach for many families. Despite these challenges, there are many dedicated teachers and educators working to improve the education system in Haiti, and there are some excellent schools and programs available, particularly in the capital city of Port-au-Prince.\n\nOverall, the education system in Haiti is in need of significant reform and investment to improve the quality and accessibility of education for all students. The government and international organizations have launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including programs to improve teacher training, increase access to education for disadvantaged groups, and provide resources and infrastructure to schools. However, much work remains to be done to ensure that all students in Haiti have access to a high-quality education that prepares them for success in their future careers and lives.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
