[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Haiti is located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago, situated in the Caribbean Sea. The country shares the island with the Dominican Republic, with which it borders to the east. The two countries are separated by a 391-kilometer border, with the Dominican Republic occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island. Haiti is surrounded by several bodies of water, including the Caribbean Sea to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the north, and the Gulf of Gonâve to the northwest.

Haiti's strategic location in the Caribbean makes it an important hub for trade and commerce. The country's proximity to the United States, Cuba, and other Caribbean islands has also made it a crucial location for international relations and diplomacy. The border with the Dominican Republic is a significant factor in Haiti's geography, as it has played a major role in shaping the country's history, culture, and economy.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Haiti's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, valleys, and coastal plains. The country's mountainous regions are dominated by the **Massif du Nord** and the **Chaîne des Matheux**, which stretch across the northern and central parts of the country. The highest point in Haiti, **Pic la Selle**, is located in the **Chaîne de la Selle** mountain range in the southeastern part of the country. The mountains are covered with a mix of tropical forests, grasslands, and agricultural lands, which provide a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna.

The coastal regions of Haiti are generally flat and narrow, with several **bays** and **peninsulas** that provide natural harbors and anchorages. The **Gulf of Gonâve** is a large bay that stretches along the western coast of Haiti, providing a sheltered anchorage for ships and boats. The coastal plains are home to several major cities, including **Port-au-Prince**, the capital and largest city of Haiti. The **Artibonite River**, which flows through the central part of the country, is the longest river in Haiti and provides water and fertile soil for agriculture.

The country's terrain has been shaped by a combination of tectonic activity, erosion, and human activity. Haiti is located in a seismically active region, and the country has experienced several major earthquakes in recent years, including the devastating **2010 earthquake** that caused widespread damage and loss of life. The country's terrain has also been affected by deforestation, soil erosion, and other environmental factors, which have contributed to landslides, flooding, and other natural disasters.
