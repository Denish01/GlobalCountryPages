# Best Time to Visit Haiti — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Haiti is during the dry season, from December to May, when the weather is generally sunny and dry, making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploration.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Haiti: December to May. Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: October and November due to heavy rainfall and potential hurricanes. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti has a tropical climate with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by low humidity and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, with the most significant rainfall occurring in October and November. The country's climate is also influenced by its mountainous terrain, with the higher elevations experiencing cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the coastal areas.

The dry season is the best time to visit Haiti's beaches, go hiking, and explore the country's cultural and historical sites. The weather is generally sunny and dry, with average temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C). In contrast, the wet season can make travel more challenging, with heavy rainfall and potential flooding, especially in the coastal areas. However, the wet season is also a great time to see Haiti's lush vegetation and waterfalls, which are at their peak during this time.

Haiti's climate zones vary by region, with the northern part of the country experiencing a slightly cooler and drier climate than the southern part. The mountainous regions, such as the Massif du Nord and the Chaîne des Matheux, have a cooler and more temperate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 50°F to 70°F (10°C to 21°C). The coastal areas, such as Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïten, have a hotter and more humid climate, with average temperatures ranging from 80°F to 100°F (27°C to 38°C).
