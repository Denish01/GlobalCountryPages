[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti's healthcare system is mixed, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and long wait times. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. Having health insurance is recommended, as it can help cover the cost of medical care, especially in private facilities.

The healthcare system in Haiti is also heavily reliant on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international aid, which can provide essential services, particularly in rural areas. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the provider and the location. In general, medical facilities in urban areas, such as Port-au-Prince, tend to be better equipped and staffed than those in rural areas. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care at private facilities or clinics that cater specifically to expats and international patients.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 115, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital or clinic. Ambulance services are limited, and it may be necessary to arrange for private transportation to a medical facility. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care at private facilities or clinics that cater specifically to expats and international patients. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Haiti include the **Hôpital Universitaire de la Paix** and the **Hôpital Bernard Mevs**, both located in Port-au-Prince. These hospitals offer modern facilities and equipment, as well as staff who speak English and other languages. However, even at these facilities, the cost of medical care can be high, and it is essential to have adequate health insurance coverage or access to funds to cover the cost of treatment.
