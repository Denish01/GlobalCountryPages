[SECTION] How Haiti Is Divided [/SECTION]
Haiti is divided into 10 departments, which are further subdivided into 42 arrondissements and 145 communes. The departments are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and each has its own unique character and economy. The departments are: Artibonite, Centre, Grand'Anse, Nippes, Nord, Nord-Est, Nord-Ouest, Ouest, Sud, and Sud-Est. This division allows for more localized governance and decision-making, which is important for a country with diverse regional needs and priorities.

The administrative structure of Haiti is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. The departments are responsible for implementing national policies and programs at the local level, and they work closely with the central government to ensure that the needs of their communities are met. This structure has helped to promote regional development and has enabled Haiti to make progress in areas such as poverty reduction and economic growth.
