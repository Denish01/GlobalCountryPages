Haiti is one of the most affordable countries in the Caribbean, with a GDP per capita (PPP) of $3,194. The cost of living in Haiti is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, making it an attractive destination for expats, digital nomads, and travelers. However, the country's economy is still recovering from the 2010 earthquake and faces significant challenges, including high inflation and limited access to basic services. A budget of $400-600 per month can provide a basic lifestyle, while $800-1,200 per month can offer a more comfortable mid-range lifestyle. For those who want to enjoy a higher standard of living, $1,800-2,500 per month can provide a comfortable lifestyle with access to modern amenities and services.

Compared to neighboring countries, Haiti is generally more affordable than the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola. However, the cost of living in Haiti can vary significantly depending on the location, with Port-au-Prince being the most expensive city. The high inflation rate of 26.9% can also erode the purchasing power of expats and locals alike, making it essential to budget carefully and plan for price increases. Overall, Haiti offers a unique blend of affordability and cultural richness, making it an attractive destination for those who are willing to adapt to the local way of life.
