  "content": "Haiti's infrastructure is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, including a lack of investment, natural disasters, and limited access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 38% of population\nInternet Penetration: 35%\nRoad Network: 4,266 km, poor quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nHaiti's infrastructure is one of the least developed in the Western Hemisphere, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country has made some progress in recent years, with investments in road construction and energy generation, but much work remains to be done. The urban-rural gap is particularly pronounced, with cities such as Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïten having relatively better access to services, while rural areas often lack even the most basic infrastructure. The **2010 earthquake** had a devastating impact on Haiti's infrastructure, and the country is still recovering from the disaster.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are signs of progress, with the government and international donors investing in infrastructure development. The **Inter-American Development Bank** and the **World Bank** are among the key partners supporting Haiti's infrastructure development efforts. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps and support the country's economic development.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure is a major constraint to Haiti's economic growth, with businesses and individuals often forced to rely on expensive and unreliable private providers for services such as electricity and water. This not only increases costs but also undermines the competitiveness of Haitian businesses. Addressing the infrastructure gap is therefore critical to supporting the country's economic development and improving the living standards of its citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 4,266 km | Poor | Many roads are in disrepair, and traffic congestion is a major problem in urban areas |\n| Railways | none | - | Haiti has no rail network |\n| Airports | 4 international, 2 domestic | Moderate | The main airport, Toussaint Louverture International Airport, is in need of upgrading |\n| Ports | 2 major | Poor | The ports of Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïten are in need of modernization |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Haiti's power generation is largely based on imported fossil fuels, which are expensive and subject to price volatility\n- The country has significant potential for **renewable energy**, particularly solar and wind power, but this remains largely untapped\n- Electricity access is limited, with only 38% of the population having access to electricity\n- Power outages are frequent, and the reliability of the grid is a major concern\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy and improve the efficiency of the grid\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to safe drinking water is a major challenge, with many people relying on untreated water sources\n- Sanitation coverage is also limited, with only 30% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities\n- In rural areas, the situation is particularly dire, with many people lacking access to even basic water and sanitation services\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve access to water and sanitation, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sanitation facilities\n- **Water-borne diseases** such as cholera remain a major public health concern, particularly in the aftermath of natural disasters\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile phone coverage is relatively widespread, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile services\n- Internet penetration is lower, at around 35%, but is increasing rapidly\n- The country has seen significant investment in **fiber-optic cables**, which has improved the quality and reliability of internet services\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support economic development and improve public services\n- **4G** services are available in some areas, but coverage is limited, and **5G** services are not yet available\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a number of major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of new roads and the upgrade of existing ones\n- The **Caracol Industrial Park** is a major development project that aims to promote economic growth and job creation in the north of the country\n- The **Port-au-Prince Port** is being upgraded to improve the efficiency and capacity of the port\n- The government has also launched initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy and improve the efficiency of the grid\n- International donors such as the **Inter-American Development Bank** and the **World Bank** are providing significant funding for infrastructure development projects in Haiti",
