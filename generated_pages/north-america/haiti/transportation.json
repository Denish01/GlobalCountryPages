  "content": "To get around in Haiti, you can use a combination of taxis, buses, and rental cars, as well as domestic flights, although the transportation infrastructure is generally underdeveloped and can be challenging to navigate.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Toussaint Louverture International Airport (PAP)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nHaiti has two main international airports: Toussaint Louverture International Airport (PAP) in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïten International Airport (CAP) in Cap-Haïten. Toussaint Louverture International Airport is the primary entry point for most visitors, with direct flights from major hubs such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and New York. You can also enter Haiti overland from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. The main overland entry points are at the border towns of Dajabón and Jimaní.\n\nIf you're planning to travel to Haiti from Europe or other parts of the world, you may need to connect through a major hub such as Miami or Panama City. Some airlines that operate flights to Haiti include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Spirit Airlines. It's a good idea to research and book your flights in advance, as prices can vary depending on the time of year and availability. Additionally, be sure to check the latest travel advisories and requirements, such as visa requirements and health certificates, before planning your trip.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nHaiti has a limited domestic air network, with few scheduled flights between major cities. However, some airlines such as Sunrise Airways and Missionary Flights International offer charter flights and private plane rentals. If you need to travel within Haiti, you may be able to find domestic flights from Port-au-Prince to other major cities such as Cap-Haïten or Jérémie. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, and it's often easier to work with a local travel agent or tour operator. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $300 per person, depending on the route and airline.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nHaiti has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. This is due in part to the country's rugged terrain and lack of investment in transportation infrastructure. As a result, visitors and locals alike rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and private cars.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nHaiti has a network of intercity buses and coaches that connect major cities and towns. Companies such as Caribe Tours and Capital Coach Line operate bus services from Port-au-Prince to other parts of the country. However, the quality of the buses and roads can vary greatly, and travel times can be long and unpredictable. Costs for bus travel can range from $10 to $50 per person, depending on the route and type of bus.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Port-au-Prince, other major cities | $0.50-$1.00 | Crowded and unpredictable |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10 per ride | Negotiate the fare before you start |\n| Ride-Hailing | Port-au-Prince, other major cities | $5-$10 per ride | Use local apps such as Heetch or Yucca |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Some cities | $2-$5 per ride | Not always available |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Haiti, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a **car rental** agreement or ownership documents.\n- Road conditions in Haiti are generally poor, with many roads in disrepair or unpaved.\n- Fuel costs can be high, with gasoline prices averaging around $5 per gallon.\n- When renting a car, be sure to choose a reputable company and inspect the vehicle carefully before you drive away.\n- Hazards on the road can include potholes, **traffic congestion**, and **aggressive driving**.\n- It's also a good idea to hire a local driver or guide, especially if you're not familiar with the roads and traffic customs in Haiti.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** and **theft** when using public transportation or taxis, and always negotiate the fare before you start.\n- Use **local currency** (Haitian gourde) or **US dollars** for transportation costs, as credit cards may not be widely accepted.\n- Download **local apps** such as Heetch or Yucca for ride-hailing and transportation services.\n- Avoid traveling at night, especially on rural roads, due to **safety concerns** and poor road conditions.\n- Consider hiring a **local guide** or driver to help you navigate the roads and transportation systems.\n- Be prepared for **delays** and **cancellations** when using public transportation or domestic flights.\n- Always wear a **seatbelt** and follow local **traffic laws** when driving or riding in a vehicle.\n- Keep your **valuables** secure and be mindful of your surroundings when using public transportation or walking in crowded areas.",
