[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti's rental market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional housing, with a high demand for apartments in the city center. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through informal negotiations. Compared to its regional neighbors, Haiti's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center, due to the high demand for housing and limited supply. However, the cost of living in Haiti is still relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and foreigners.

The housing market in Haiti is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including the high inflation rate of 26.9% and the limited availability of credit. As a result, many Haitians rely on informal housing arrangements, such as renting rooms or apartments in shared houses. The government has implemented initiatives to improve the housing sector, including the construction of new housing units and the provision of subsidies for low-income families. However, much work remains to be done to address the country's housing needs, particularly in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake that devastated the country.
