  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Haiti can vary significantly depending on the location, usage, and provider, with a typical monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment ranging from $150 to $300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($50 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: HTG\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nHaiti's utility infrastructure is still developing, with many areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate significantly due to seasonal variation, with higher prices during the dry season (December to May) when water and electricity demand are higher. Additionally, the country's high inflation rate of 26.9% can lead to frequent price increases, making it challenging for residents to budget for their utility expenses.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Haiti is generally poor, with many households relying on alternative sources of energy, such as generators or solar panels, to supplement the unreliable public grid. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but progress has been slow, and many areas still lack access to basic services like electricity and clean water. As a result, utility costs can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited financial resources.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | Prepaid meters available |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | Metered usage, plus fixed monthly fee |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | Propane tanks, no piped gas |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | Included in water bill or separate |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Digicel, Natcom |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-100 | 60 Mbps | Digicel, Natcom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Digicel, Natcom |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | Digicel, Natcom |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Digicel, Natcom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | Available with international credit card |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | Available with international credit card |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Limited content, Haitian Creole and French |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents typically need to visit the provider's office in person and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget their energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Haiti are Digicel and Natcom, which offer a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can consider using energy-efficient appliances, conserving water, and negotiating with providers for better rates.\n- It's also a good idea to regularly review and adjust utility plans to ensure they are still meeting household needs and budgets.",
