        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Haiti, a sovereign country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean, has a rich and complex history. The island was first inhabited by the <strong>Taino</strong> people, an indigenous group that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1492, Christopher Columbus landed on the island, and it became a Spanish colony. In 1697, the western part of the island was ceded to France, and it became known as Saint-Domingue. The French established a prosperous colony, with sugar, coffee, and indigo plantations that relied heavily on <strong>slave labor</strong>. The enslaved population, which consisted of Africans brought to the island by the French, developed a unique culture and language, known as <strong>Haitian Creole</strong>.</p>
        <p>In 1791, a slave revolt led by <strong>Boukman</strong>, <strong>Toussaint Louverture</strong>, and <strong>Jean-Jacques Dessalines</strong> began, and it would eventually lead to the establishment of Haiti as the first independent black nation in the world. The Haitian Revolution, which lasted from 1791 to 1804, was a successful rebellion that overthrew the French colonial government and established Haiti as a sovereign state. On January 1, 1804, Haiti declared its independence, with Dessalines as its first leader. The country's early years were marked by struggle and conflict, including a civil war and the assassination of Dessalines in 1806.</p>
        <p>The 19th and 20th centuries saw Haiti experience a series of coups, dictatorships, and foreign interventions. In 1915, the United States occupied Haiti, and the country remained under American control until 1934. The Duvalier dynasty, which ruled Haiti from 1957 to 1986, was marked by authoritarianism and human rights abuses. In 1990, Haiti held its first democratic elections, and <strong>Jean-Bertrand Aristide</strong> was elected president. However, his presidency was cut short by a military coup in 1991. Aristide was restored to power in 1994, and he served as president until 2004, when he was ousted in a second coup.</p>
        <p>Today, Haiti continues to face significant challenges, including poverty, corruption, and environmental degradation. Despite these challenges, the country has made progress in recent years, with improvements in healthcare, education, and economic development. Haiti's unique culture, which reflects its African, French, and indigenous heritage, is an important part of its identity and a source of pride for its people.</p>
