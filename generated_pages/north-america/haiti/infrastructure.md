# Haiti Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Haiti's infrastructure is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, including a lack of investment, natural disasters, and limited access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 38% of population
Internet Penetration: 35%
Road Network: 4,266 km, poor quality
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti's infrastructure is one of the least developed in the Western Hemisphere, with significant gaps in access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country has made some progress in recent years, with investments in road construction and energy generation, but much work remains to be done. The urban-rural gap is particularly pronounced, with cities such as Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïten having relatively better access to services, while rural areas often lack even the most basic infrastructure. The **2010 earthquake** had a devastating impact on Haiti's infrastructure, and the country is still recovering from the disaster.

Despite these challenges, there are signs of progress, with the government and international donors investing in infrastructure development. The **Inter-American Development Bank** and the **World Bank** are among the key partners supporting Haiti's infrastructure development efforts. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps and support the country's economic development.

The lack of infrastructure is a major constraint to Haiti's economic growth, with businesses and individuals often forced to rely on expensive and unreliable private providers for services such as electricity and water. This not only increases costs but also undermines the competitiveness of Haitian businesses. Addressing the infrastructure gap is therefore critical to supporting the country's economic development and improving the living standards of its citizens.
