[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering services. However, the public sector is underfunded and understaffed, leading to a significant shortage of medical professionals and equipment. The private sector, on the other hand, offers better quality care, but is often unaffordable for the majority of the population. The quality of care varies greatly depending on the location, with urban areas having more access to healthcare facilities and skilled professionals than rural areas. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Haiti has one of the highest infant mortality rates and one of the lowest life expectancies in the Western Hemisphere.

The public healthcare system in Haiti is free, but it is often overcrowded and understaffed. Patients may have to wait for hours or even days to receive treatment, and medical supplies are often in short supply. In contrast, private healthcare facilities offer better quality care, but are often expensive and out of reach for most Haitians. Many Haitians rely on traditional medicine and spiritual healing, which can be ineffective and even harmful in some cases. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the construction of new hospitals and the training of medical professionals.

Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Haiti remains fragile and vulnerable to natural disasters and other crises. The 2010 earthquake, for example, devastated the country's healthcare infrastructure, leaving many hospitals and clinics destroyed or severely damaged. The international community has provided significant aid and support to help rebuild and strengthen the healthcare system, but much work remains to be done to ensure that all Haitians have access to quality healthcare.
