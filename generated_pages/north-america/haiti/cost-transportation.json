The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of maintenance being major issues. In larger cities like Port-au-Prince, the traffic can be chaotic, and the roads are often in disrepair. Despite these challenges, the Haitian people have adapted to the situation, and the transportation system, although imperfect, is a vital part of daily life.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Haiti are taptaps, motos, and taxis. Taptaps are the most affordable option, but they can be crowded and uncomfortable. Motos are a popular choice for shorter distances, but they can be hazardous, especially for passengers who are not familiar with the local traffic rules. Taxis are widely available, but the fares can be high, especially for tourists. The government has made efforts to improve the transportation infrastructure, but much work remains to be done to provide a safe and efficient transportation system for the population.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage, often overcrowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Haiti |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Routes vary, often unreliable |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Haiti |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5.00 | $1.00 | $10-$20 | Fares can be negotiated |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3.00 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Heetch, TapRide available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Prices can vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | Prices can vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$100 | Economy car, prices vary depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2.00-$5.00 | Limited toll roads, prices can vary |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | Limited routes, often uncomfortable |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited routes, often expensive |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Haiti |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using taptaps or motos for shorter distances.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure safety.\n- Always negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey.\n- Be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas or at night.\n- Consider renting a car with a driver if you plan to travel extensively outside of cities.\n- Download local transportation apps, such as Heetch or TapRide, to help navigate the transportation system.",
