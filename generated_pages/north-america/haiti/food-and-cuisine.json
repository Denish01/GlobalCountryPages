The cuisine is known for its bold flavors, aromas, and spices, with a focus on fresh ingredients such as vegetables, fruits, and meats. Haitian cooking often involves slow-cooking methods, such as stewing and braising, which help to tenderize tougher cuts of meat and bring out the deep flavors of the ingredients. Regional variations in Haitian cuisine are also notable, with different parts of the country specializing in different types of dishes, such as the **Pikliz**-spiced meats of the north and the **Akara**-fried plantains of the south.\n\nHaitian cuisine is also heavily influenced by the country's history of slavery and colonization, with many dishes reflecting the resourcefulness and creativity of enslaved Africans who were forced to make do with limited ingredients. As a result, Haitian cuisine is characterized by its use of scraps and leftovers, which are often transformed into delicious and filling meals. The cuisine is also known for its use of **Epis**, a spicy condiment made from a mixture of onions, bell peppers, and chili peppers, which adds flavor and heat to many dishes.\n\nIn addition to its rich cultural heritage, Haitian cuisine is also shaped by the country's geography and climate. The country's tropical climate and rugged terrain make it an ideal place for growing a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains, which are often used in traditional dishes. The cuisine is also influenced by the country's coastal location, with many dishes featuring fresh seafood and other seafood products.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type |
