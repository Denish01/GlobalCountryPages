  "content": "The population of Haiti is comprised of approximately 11.7 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that shape the country's cultural identity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 11.7 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 1.2%\nMedian Age: 23.6 years\nUrban Population: 57%\nPopulation Density: 426 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 63.5 years\nFertility Rate: 3.1 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nHaiti's population is relatively small compared to other countries in the region, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, which is higher than the average for countries in the Caribbean. The country's urban population accounts for about 57% of the total population, with many people migrating to cities such as Port-au-Prince in search of better economic opportunities. However, this rapid urbanization has put a strain on the country's infrastructure and resources. The population density is approximately 426 people per square kilometer, making Haiti one of the most densely populated countries in the region.\n\nThe population of Haiti is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the country and to other countries. Many Haitians have migrated to the Dominican Republic, the United States, and other countries in search of better economic opportunities. This migration has had a significant impact on the country's demographics, with many young people leaving the country in search of work. However, remittances from these migrants have also contributed significantly to the country's economy.\n\nHaiti's population has also been affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which have had a devastating impact on the country's infrastructure and population. The 2010 earthquake, for example, killed an estimated 220,000 people and left many more without homes or livelihoods. The country is still recovering from the effects of this disaster, and the population is still vulnerable to future natural disasters.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Black | 95% | Throughout the country | Descendants of African slaves |\n| Mulatto | 4% | Primarily in urban areas | Mixed African and European ancestry |\n| White | 1% | Primarily in urban areas | Descendants of European colonizers |\n| Amerindian | 0.5% | Primarily in rural areas | Indigenous people of the Caribbean |\n| Other | 0.5% | Throughout the country | Includes people of Asian, Middle Eastern, and other ancestries |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Haiti are diverse, but the majority of the population is black, with approximately 95% of the population identifying as such. The mulatto population, which accounts for about 4% of the population, has historically held a significant amount of power and influence in the country. The white population, which accounts for about 1% of the population, is primarily composed of descendants of European colonizers. The Amerindian population, which accounts for about 0.5% of the population, is primarily composed of indigenous people who have lived in the Caribbean for thousands of years. The ethnic relations in Haiti are complex, with a history of tension and conflict between different groups. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement towards greater unity and reconciliation among the different ethnic groups.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Haitian Creole** is the most widely spoken language in Haiti, with approximately 90% of the population speaking it as their first language.\n- **French** is the official language of Haiti, and it is spoken by about 40% of the population, primarily in formal settings and among the educated elite.\n- **English** is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among young people and those in the tourism industry.\n- **Spanish** is also spoken by some people in Haiti, particularly in the border regions with the Dominican Republic.\n- **Other languages**, such as African languages and indigenous languages, are also spoken by small populations in Haiti.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 55% | Official religion of Haiti |\n| Protestant | 30% | Includes a variety of denominations, such as Baptist and Methodist |\n| Vodou | 10% | Traditional Haitian religion, often practiced in combination with other religions |\n| Other | 5% | Includes Islam, Judaism, and other minority religions |\n[/TABLE]\nThe religious landscape in Haiti is diverse, with a mix of traditional and modern religions.
