[SECTION] How Expensive Is Haiti? [/SECTION]
Haiti is considered an affordable destination, with a cost of living that is lower compared to many other countries in the Caribbean. The country's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including natural disasters and political instability, which has kept prices relatively low. However, prices can vary depending on the location, with Port-au-Prince being the most expensive city. Compared to its neighbor, the Dominican Republic, Haiti is generally cheaper, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers.

In general, Haiti offers a unique blend of French and African influences, with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty. From the beautiful beaches to the vibrant markets, Haiti has a lot to offer visitors. However, the country's infrastructure and services can be limited, particularly outside of major cities.
