[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti's population is relatively small compared to other countries in the region, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, which is higher than the average for countries in the Caribbean. The country's urban population accounts for about 57% of the total population, with many people migrating to cities such as Port-au-Prince in search of better economic opportunities. However, this rapid urbanization has put a strain on the country's infrastructure and resources. The population density is approximately 426 people per square kilometer, making Haiti one of the most densely populated countries in the region.

The population of Haiti is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the country and to other countries. Many Haitians have migrated to the Dominican Republic, the United States, and other countries in search of better economic opportunities. This migration has had a significant impact on the country's demographics, with many young people leaving the country in search of work. However, remittances from these migrants have also contributed significantly to the country's economy.

Haiti's population has also been affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which have had a devastating impact on the country's infrastructure and population. The 2010 earthquake, for example, killed an estimated 220,000 people and left many more without homes or livelihoods. The country is still recovering from the effects of this disaster, and the population is still vulnerable to future natural disasters.
