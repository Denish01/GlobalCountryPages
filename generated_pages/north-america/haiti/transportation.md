[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Haiti has two main international airports: Toussaint Louverture International Airport (PAP) in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïten International Airport (CAP) in Cap-Haïten. Toussaint Louverture International Airport is the primary entry point for most visitors, with direct flights from major hubs such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and New York. You can also enter Haiti overland from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. The main overland entry points are at the border towns of Dajabón and Jimaní.

If you're planning to travel to Haiti from Europe or other parts of the world, you may need to connect through a major hub such as Miami or Panama City. Some airlines that operate flights to Haiti include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Spirit Airlines. It's a good idea to research and book your flights in advance, as prices can vary depending on the time of year and availability. Additionally, be sure to check the latest travel advisories and requirements, such as visa requirements and health certificates, before planning your trip.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Haiti has a limited domestic air network, with few scheduled flights between major cities. However, some airlines such as Sunrise Airways and Missionary Flights International offer charter flights and private plane rentals. If you need to travel within Haiti, you may be able to find domestic flights from Port-au-Prince to other major cities such as Cap-Haïten or Jérémie. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, and it's often easier to work with a local travel agent or tour operator. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $300 per person, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Haiti has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. This is due in part to the country's rugged terrain and lack of investment in transportation infrastructure. As a result, visitors and locals alike rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and private cars.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Haiti has a network of intercity buses and coaches that connect major cities and towns. Companies such as Caribe Tours and Capital Coach Line operate bus services from Port-au-Prince to other parts of the country. However, the quality of the buses and roads can vary greatly, and travel times can be long and unpredictable. Costs for bus travel can range from $10 to $50 per person, depending on the route and type of bus.

[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]
