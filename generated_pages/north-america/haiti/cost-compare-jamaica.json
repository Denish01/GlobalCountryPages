Jamaica, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy with a strong tourism sector and a growing services industry.

However, Jamaica offers a more developed infrastructure and a higher standard of living, which may justify the higher costs for some expats and visitors.\n\nThe cost of living difference between Haiti and Jamaica is significant, with Haiti being approximately 20-30% cheaper overall. This is largely due to the lower cost of accommodation and food in Haiti, as well as the country's lower overall price level. However, Jamaica offers a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which may make it a more attractive option for some visitors and expats. In terms of specific costs, Haiti is generally cheaper for accommodation, food, and transportation, while Jamaica is more expensive for these categories. However, Jamaica may offer better value for money in terms of quality of life and access to amenities.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Haiti (USD) | Jamaica (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 400 | 100% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 300 | 100% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 800 | 100% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Haiti (USD) | Jamaica (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 100% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 80 | 60% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 50% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 100% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Haiti (USD) | Jamaica (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 100% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 100% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Haiti (USD) | Jamaica (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 60% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 50% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 100% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Haiti (USD) | Jamaica (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% savings |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% savings |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% savings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Haiti is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation: Haiti offers significantly cheaper accommodation options, with prices for apartments and houses being 50-100% lower than in Jamaica.\n- Food: Haiti has a more affordable food scene, with meals at restaurants and groceries being 50-100% cheaper than in Jamaica.\n- Transportation: Haiti has lower transportation costs, with taxis and fuel being 50-100% cheaper than in Jamaica.\n- Utilities: Haiti has lower utility costs, with internet and mobile plans being 50-100% cheaper than in Jamaica.\n- **Jamaica is cheaper for:**\n- Quality of life: Jamaica offers a higher standard of living and better access to amenities, which may justify the higher costs for some expats and visitors.\n- Tourism infrastructure: Jamaica has a more developed tourism infrastructure, with better roads, airports, and tourist facilities.\n- Education: Jamaica has a more developed education system, with better schools and universities.\n- Healthcare: Jamaica has a more developed healthcare system, with better hospitals and medical facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nHaiti and Jamaica offer different value propositions for visitors and expats.
