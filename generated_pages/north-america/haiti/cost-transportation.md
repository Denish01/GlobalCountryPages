[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Haiti's transportation network is limited, with most people relying on **taptaps** (colorfully decorated trucks or buses) and **motos** (motorcycles) to get around. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of maintenance being major issues. In larger cities like Port-au-Prince, the traffic can be chaotic, and the roads are often in disrepair. Despite these challenges, the Haitian people have adapted to the situation, and the transportation system, although imperfect, is a vital part of daily life.

The main transportation modes in Haiti are taptaps, motos, and taxis. Taptaps are the most affordable option, but they can be crowded and uncomfortable. Motos are a popular choice for shorter distances, but they can be hazardous, especially for passengers who are not familiar with the local traffic rules. Taxis are widely available, but the fares can be high, especially for tourists. The government has made efforts to improve the transportation infrastructure, but much work remains to be done to provide a safe and efficient transportation system for the population.
