[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Panama has been steadily growing over the years, with a moderate growth rate of 1.3% per annum. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a high total fertility rate and a relatively low mortality rate. The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 67% of the population living in urban areas. The capital city, Panama City, is the largest urban center, accounting for a significant proportion of the country's population. Panama's strategic location and economic growth have also made it a popular destination for migrants from other parts of Central and South America.

The country's population is expected to continue growing, driven by a young population and a relatively high fertility rate. However, the population growth rate is expected to slow down in the coming years due to declining fertility rates and an increasing proportion of the population reaching retirement age. The government has implemented various policies to manage population growth and urbanization, including investing in education and family planning programs.

Panama's population is also characterized by a significant proportion of international migrants, with many people coming to the country to work on the Panama Canal or in other industries. This has contributed to the country's cultural diversity and has helped to drive economic growth.
