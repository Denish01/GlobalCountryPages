[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Panama's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being largely funded by the government and the private system being driven by private insurance and out-of-pocket payments. The quality of care in Panama is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics having modern equipment and well-trained staff. However, there can be significant disparities in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas like Panama City having access to more advanced medical facilities and specialized care. The public healthcare system provides coverage for all citizens, including expats who have obtained residency, but the private system is often preferred by those who can afford it due to its higher standard of care and shorter wait times.

The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the public healthcare system, which includes a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. The public system provides a range of services, including emergency care, surgical services, and preventive care, but it can be overcrowded and underfunded, leading to long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private system offers a wider range of services, including specialized care and advanced medical procedures, but it can be expensive and may not be accessible to all.

Overall, Panama's healthcare system is well-developed and provides a high standard of care, especially in urban areas. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including disparities in access to care and the need for increased funding and resources.
