The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with approximately 67% of the population living in urban areas. The capital city, Panama City, is the largest urban center, accounting for a significant proportion of the country's population.

However, the population growth rate is expected to slow down in the coming years due to declining fertility rates and an increasing proportion of the population reaching retirement age.
