Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with laws in place to regulate rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Panama's housing costs are relatively moderate, with Costa Rica being more expensive and Colombia being more affordable. The country's **strategic location** and **growing economy** have made it an attractive destination for expats and investors, driving up demand for housing and rental properties.\n\nThe Panamanian government has implemented various initiatives to promote **affordable housing** and regulate the rental market. For example, the **rent control law** limits annual rent increases to 10% of the previous year's rent. Additionally, the government has established programs to provide **subsidized housing** for low-income families and individuals. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Panama remains competitive, and renters should be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property. It's also essential to work with a reputable real estate agent and to thoroughly review the lease agreement before signing.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$900 | $300-$600 | (typical quality, 30-50 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | (what to expect, 50-80 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,200 | (family size, 80-120 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$1,800 | (spacious, 120-180 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$3,500 | (prime locations, such as **Punta Pacifica** and **Obarrio**) |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | (residential areas, such as **Albrook** and **Clayton**) |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | (if applicable, such as **Boquete** and **Bocas del Toro**) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Punta Pacifica**: a modern, upscale neighborhood with high-rise apartments and stunning ocean views, typical rent range $1,000-$2,000 per month\n- **Obarrio**: a bustling commercial district with a mix of old and new buildings, typical rent range $800-$1,500 per month\n- **Albrook**: a quiet, residential neighborhood with easy access to the city center, typical rent range $600-$1,200 per month\n- **Casco Viejo**: a historic, charming neighborhood with a vibrant nightlife, typical rent range $800-$1,500 per month\n- **Clayton**: a suburban neighborhood with a mix of apartments and houses, typical rent range $400-$1,000 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Panama [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly and visit properties in person before making a decision\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property and navigate the rental process\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms, if possible, and make sure to review the contract carefully before signing\n- Be aware of **scams** and **fraudulent** activities, and never pay a deposit without verifying the property's ownership and the agent's credentials\n- Utilities, such as water and electricity, are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished ones, so be prepared to purchase or rent furniture if necessary\n- Consider hiring a **lawyer** to review the contract and provide guidance on the rental process, especially if you're not fluent in **Spanish**.",
