[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Panama has two main international airports: Tocumen International Airport (PTY) and Panama Pacific International Airport (BLB). Tocumen International Airport is the primary hub for international flights, with direct connections to major cities in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. You can fly directly to Panama from cities like Miami, New York, Amsterdam, and Madrid, among others. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from Costa Rica to the west and Colombia to the east. If you're planning to enter Panama by land, you can take a bus or drive from these neighboring countries.

If you're traveling from within the Americas, you can also consider flying into Panama Pacific International Airport, which serves as a hub for regional flights. Additionally, many cruise ships stop at ports in Panama, providing another option for getting to the country. Regardless of how you arrive, you'll find that Panama has a well-developed transportation infrastructure, making it easy to get around and explore the country.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Panama has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airlines are Copa Airlines and Air Panama, which offer flights to various destinations, including popular tourist spots like Bocas del Toro and Boquete. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agency, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 USD per person, one way. It's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best rates.

Panama has a limited rail network, with no high-speed options available. The country's rail system is primarily used for freight transportation, and there are no passenger trains that connect major cities. However, there are some tourist trains that operate on a limited basis, offering scenic rides through the countryside. One example is the Panama Canal Railway, which runs from Panama City to Colón and offers stunning views of the canal. If you're interested in taking a train ride, it's best to check with local tour operators or travel agencies for availability and booking information.

Prices vary depending on the route and class of service, but you can expect to pay around $10 to $50 USD per person, one way.
