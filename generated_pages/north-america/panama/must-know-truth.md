# The Truth About Panama - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Panama has a rich and complex history, with various cultures and empires vying for control over the region. The first inhabitants of Panama were indigenous peoples, including the Cueva and Coclé cultures, who arrived around 10,000 BC. The Spanish colonization of Panama began in 1501, when Rodrigo de Bastidas became the first European to explore the region. In 1519, Panama City was founded by Pedro Arias de Ávila, and it became an important center for trade and commerce in the Spanish Empire. Panama declared its independence from Spain on November 28, 1821, and became part of the Republic of Gran Colombia, which also included present-day Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela.

In 1830, Panama became part of the Republic of New Granada, which later became the Republic of Colombia. However, Panama's strategic location and economic importance led to tensions with Colombia, and on November 3, 1903, Panama declared its independence from Colombia with the support of the United States. The United States played a significant role in Panama's early years as an independent nation, particularly with the construction of the Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914. The canal was a major engineering feat that connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and had a significant impact on global trade and commerce.

Panama's early years as an independent nation were marked by political instability and power struggles, with various factions vying for control. In 1968, a military coup led by General Omar Torrijos took power, and Torrijos implemented a range of economic and social reforms. After Torrijos' death in 1981, General Manuel Noriega took power, and his regime was marked by corruption, human rights abuses, and tensions with the United States. In 1989, the United States invaded Panama, and Noriega was ousted. Since then, Panama has transitioned to a democratic government and has experienced significant economic growth and development.

Today, Panama is a **sovereign** nation with a **presidential** system of government. The country has a diverse economy, with major industries including finance, logistics, and tourism. Panama's strategic location and business-friendly environment have made it an attractive destination for foreign investment and trade. The country is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the World Trade Organization.
