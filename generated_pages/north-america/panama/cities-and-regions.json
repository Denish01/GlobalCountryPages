The provinces are further divided into districts, corregimientos, and corregimientos are divided into barrios. Additionally, there are 3 indigenous regions, known as comarcas, which are autonomous territories with their own governance structures. The provinces and comarcas are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and they play a significant role in the country's governance and development. The 10 provinces of Panama are Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, Cocle, Colon, Darien, Herrera, Los Santos, Panama, Panama Oeste, and Veraguas.\n\nThe administrative structure of Panama is designed to provide a framework for the country's governance, economic development, and social services. The provinces and comarcas have a significant degree of autonomy, which allows them to manage their own affairs and make decisions that are in the best interest of their residents. The central government, on the other hand, is responsible for providing overall direction and guidance, as well as ensuring that the country's laws and policies are enforced consistently across all provinces and comarcas.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Panama City** (880,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its modern skyscrapers, vibrant nightlife, and rich cultural heritage\nBest For: business travelers, cultural enthusiasts, and foodies\n**Colon** (220,000)\nRole: port city, industrial center\nKnown For: its strategic location on the Caribbean coast and its role in the country's economy\nBest For: business travelers, historians, and those interested in industry and commerce\n**David** (140,000)\nRole: provincial capital, commercial center\nKnown For: its pleasant climate, beautiful parks, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: tourists, nature lovers, and those interested in exploring the country's interior\n**La Chorrera** (110,000)\nRole: provincial capital, agricultural center\nKnown For: its rich agricultural land, beautiful scenery, and outdoor recreational opportunities\nBest For: nature lovers, outdoor enthusiasts, and those interested in agriculture and rural life\n**Penonome** (80,000)\nRole: provincial capital, commercial center\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and traditional festivals\nBest For: tourists, cultural enthusiasts, and those interested in history and tradition\n**Santiago** (70,000)\nRole: provincial capital, commercial center\nKnown For: its pleasant climate, beautiful scenery, and outdoor recreational opportunities\nBest For: tourists, nature lovers, and those interested in exploring the country's interior\n**Chitre** (60,000)\nRole: provincial capital, commercial center\nKnown For: its rich cultural heritage, historic architecture, and traditional festivals\nBest For: tourists, cultural enthusiasts, and those interested in history and tradition\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bocas del Toro | tropical, Caribbean | beautiful beaches, coral reefs, eco-tourism | Bocas del Toro |\n| Chiriqui | mountainous, cool climate | coffee plantations, hiking, outdoor recreation | David |\n| Cocle | coastal, tropical | beautiful beaches, historic sites, cultural festivals | Penonome |\n| Colon | coastal, industrial | port city, industrial center, commercial hub | Colon |\n| Darien | jungle, remote | wilderness adventure, eco-tourism, indigenous communities | La Palma |\n| Herrera | coastal, tropical | beautiful beaches, historic sites, cultural festivals | Chitre |\n| Los Santos | coastal, tropical | beautiful beaches, historic sites, cultural festivals | Las Tablas |\n| Panama | metropolitan, urban | modern city, cultural center, economic hub | Panama City |\n| Panama Oeste | metropolitan, urban | suburban area, commercial center, residential | La Chorrera |\n| Veraguas | coastal, tropical | beautiful beaches, historic sites, cultural festivals | Santiago |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Panama differ significantly in terms of culture, with the indigenous regions having a distinct cultural identity and the provinces having a more mestizo culture.\n- The economy of the regions also varies, with some provinces having a strong industrial base and others relying on agriculture or tourism.\n- The climate of the regions differs, with the coastal provinces having a tropical climate and the mountainous regions having a cooler climate.\n- The language spoken in the regions is predominantly Spanish, but there are also several indigenous languages spoken in the comarcas.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nPanama has a well-developed transportation system, with domestic flights, buses, and taxis available. The country's main airport, Tocumen International Airport, is located in Panama City and offers flights to major cities around the world. Domestic flights are also available to major cities and tourist destinations. The bus system is extensive and affordable, with buses connecting major cities and towns. Taxis are also widely available, but it's recommended to use licensed taxis or ride-sharing services. Driving in Panama can be challenging, especially in urban areas, due to heavy traffic and congestion. However, the country's roads are generally well-maintained, and renting a car can be a good option for exploring the countryside.
