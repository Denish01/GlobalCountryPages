[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Panama is a sovereign country located in Central America, connecting North America to South America. It is situated on the Isthmus of Panama, a narrow strip of land that bridges the two continents. The country is bordered by Costa Rica to the west and Colombia to the east. To the north, Panama is bounded by the Caribbean Sea, while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south. The country's unique geography makes it a crucial transportation hub, with the Panama Canal connecting the two oceans and allowing ships to pass through the continent.

The country's borders with Costa Rica and Colombia are largely defined by natural features, such as rivers and mountain ranges. The border with Costa Rica is approximately 330 kilometers long, while the border with Colombia is around 225 kilometers long. Panama's coastline is approximately 2,490 kilometers long, with the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The country's strategic location makes it an important hub for international trade and commerce.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Panama's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, forests, and coastal plains. The country's mountainous regions are dominated by the **Cordillera Central**, a range that stretches from the border with Costa Rica to the border with Colombia. The highest point in the country is **Volcan Baru**, an active volcano that rises to an elevation of 3,475 meters. The mountainous regions are home to a variety of ecosystems, including cloud forests, rainforests, and paramo grasslands.

The country's coastal plains are narrow and fertile, with many rivers flowing into the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The **Panama Canal**, one of the most important waterways in the world, crosses the country from east to west, connecting the two oceans. The canal is approximately 80 kilometers long and allows ships to pass through the continent, saving time and fuel. Panama's forests are also an important feature of the country's landscape, with many national parks and protected areas preserving the country's rich biodiversity.

Panama's landscape is also characterized by a variety of islands, including the **Pearl Islands** and the **San Blas Islands**. These islands are located off the coast of Panama and are known for their beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and diverse marine life. The country's geography is also home to many rivers, including the **Chagres River**, which flows into the Caribbean Sea, and the **Tuira River**, which flows into the Pacific Ocean.
