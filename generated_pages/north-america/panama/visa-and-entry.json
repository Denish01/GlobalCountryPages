[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nPanama has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country's strategic location and growing economy have made it an attractive destination for tourists, business travelers, and expats. Citizens of over 100 countries can enter Panama visa-free, making it a popular destination for international travelers. The Panamanian government has also implemented various initiatives to facilitate the entry of foreign visitors, including the introduction of an electronic visa system and a special visa program for remote workers.\n\nThe visa policy in Panama is designed to promote tourism, trade, and investment, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. The government has established a range of visa categories, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. Visitors can stay in Panama for up to 180 days, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 180 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 180 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 180 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 180 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 180 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply at a Panamanian embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Panama without a visa and stay for up to 180 days.
