However, there are also several regional dialects and minority languages spoken in Panama, including indigenous languages such as Kuna and Ngäbere, as well as English, which is widely spoken in tourist areas and among businesspeople. The English proficiency of Panamanians is moderate, with many people in the service industry and tourism sector speaking some English, but it is still a good idea to learn some basic Spanish phrases to communicate effectively. The Latin script is used to write Spanish, and the language belongs to the Romance language family, which also includes languages such as French, Italian, and Portuguese.\n\nIn addition to Spanish, there are also several indigenous languages spoken in Panama, including Kuna, which is spoken by the Kuna people, who live in the San Blas Islands, and Ngäbere, which is spoken by the Ngäbere people, who live in the western part of the country. These languages are an important part of Panama's cultural heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote them. English is also widely spoken in Panama, particularly in tourist areas and among businesspeople, and it is often used as a second language in international communication.\n\nThe use of language in Panama is also influenced by the country's history and cultural diversity. Many Panamanians have a mix of Spanish, African, and indigenous ancestry, and this is reflected in the language and customs of the country. For example, many Panamanians use African-influenced words and phrases in their everyday language, and the country's music and dance traditions also reflect its cultural diversity. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Panama is complex and diverse, with a mix of Spanish, indigenous languages, and English, as well as African and other cultural influences.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola | OH-lah | formal |\n| Hello (informal) |Hola, ¿cómo estás? | OH-lah KOH-moh eh-STAH | informal |\n| Thank you | Gracias | GRAH-see-ahs |  |\n| Please | Por favor | pohr fah-VOHR |  |\n| Yes / No | Sí / No | SEE / NOH |  |\n| Excuse me | Con permiso | kohn pehr-MEE-soh |  |\n| How much? | ¿Cuánto cuesta? | KWAHN-toh KWEHS-tah |  |\n| Where is...? | ¿Dónde está...? | DOHN-deh eh-STAH |  |\n| I don't understand | No entiendo | noh ehn-tee-EHN-doh |  |\n| Do you speak English? | ¿Habla inglés? | AHB-lah eeng-lee-EHZ |  |\n| Help! | ¡Ayuda! | ah-YOO-dah |  |\n| Goodbye | Adiós | ah-DEE-yos | formal |\n| Goodbye (informal) | Hasta luego | AH-stah LOH-goh | informal |\n| Sorry | Lo siento | LOH see-en-toh |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Uno | OO-noh |\n| 2 | Dos | DOH-s |\n| 3 | Tres | TRAY-s |\n| 4 | Cuatro | KWAH-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | SIHN-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | SAY-s |\n| 7 | Siete | SEE-eht-eh |\n| 8 | Ocho | OH-choh |\n| 9 | Nueve | NWAY-vay |\n| 10 | Diez | DEE-ez |\n| 100 | Cien | SEE-ehn |\n| 1000 | Mil | MEEL |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when communicating with Panamanians, using formal language and titles such as \"señor\" or \"señora\" until you are invited to use first names.\n- Learn some basic Spanish phrases, such as \"gracias\" (thank you) and \"por favor\" (please), to show respect and appreciation for the culture.\n- Use body language and gestures to communicate, such as waving or using hand gestures to get attention.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered rude or insulting, such as pointing with the index finger or using the \"okay\" sign.\n- Be patient and try to understand the local accent and dialect, which may be different from the Spanish you are used to.\n- Use a dictionary or phrasebook to help with communication, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you don't understand something.\n- Be mindful of the formal and informal levels of communication, using formal language with strangers or in formal situations, and informal language with friends or in casual situations.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app such as Google Translate or iTranslate to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a language class or use online resources to learn basic Spanish phrases and grammar.\n- Use online translation tools such as Microsoft Translator or Babylon to translate text and web pages.\n- Ask your hotel or tour operator for a list of recommended translation services or language schools in the area.",
