Panama's internet quality is generally good, with an average speed of 15 Mbps download, which is sufficient for streaming, browsing, and other online activities. However, there is a noticeable urban vs rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections found in cities like Panama City, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and fewer options. The internet reliability in Panama is also relatively high, with few reports of frequent outages or disruptions, making it a good destination for remote workers and digital nomads.

In terms of infrastructure, Panama has invested heavily in its telecommunications sector, with a focus on expanding coverage and improving speeds. This has resulted in a well-developed network of fiber-optic cables, cell towers, and other infrastructure, which supports the country's growing demand for internet services. Additionally, many cafes, restaurants, and other public places offer free WiFi, making it easy to stay connected while on the go.

Getting a SIM card in Panama is relatively straightforward, with several options available for tourists and visitors. The main carriers, including Claro, Digicel, and Movistar, offer a range of prepaid plans and SIM cards specifically designed for tourists, which can be purchased at airports, carrier stores, and other retail outlets. To buy a SIM card, you will typically need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some carriers may have additional requirements. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as this will ensure that you have access to the best coverage and speeds.

When selecting a carrier, consider factors such as coverage, speed, and data limits, as well as any additional features or perks that may be included. For example, some carriers may offer free roaming in other countries, or additional data allowances for social media or streaming services.
