The country has made significant strides in recent years to improve security and reduce crime rates. However, as with any travel destination, there are areas that are considered safer than others, and visitors should take normal precautions to protect themselves and their belongings. The capital city, Panama City, is a bustling metropolis with a mix of modern and historic neighborhoods, and visitors should be aware of their surroundings, especially at night.\n\nPanama's safety record is also influenced by its geography and climate. The country is prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and hurricanes, which can affect travel plans and safety. Additionally, the border regions with Colombia and Costa Rica can be considered higher-risk areas due to the presence of organized crime groups and smuggling activities. However, these areas are generally not frequented by tourists, and the Panamanian government has implemented measures to improve security and cooperation with neighboring countries.\n\n[SECTION] Safety By Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/Region | Safety Level | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Panama City | High | Modern and historic neighborhoods, well-patrolled by police |\n| Canal Zone | High | Popular tourist area, well-secured and monitored |\n| Boquete | High | Safe and welcoming town in the Chiriqui Highlands |\n| Bocas del Toro | Moderate | Popular island destination, some petty crime and scams reported |\n| Colon | Low | High crime rates, avoid walking alone at night |\n| Darien Province | Low | Remote and rugged region, bordering Colombia, avoid non-essential travel |\n| Gamboa | Moderate | Popular eco-tourism destination, some reports of petty crime |\n| San Blas Islands | Moderate | Autonomous territory, some reports of petty crime and scams |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Common Risks & Scams [/SECTION]\n- **Pickpocketing** and **theft** are common in crowded areas and tourist hotspots.\n- **Scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced tours or fake police officers, have been reported.\n- **Traffic accidents** are a risk, especially when driving at night or in rural areas.\n- **Petty crime** such as **mugging** and **burglary** can occur in urban areas.\n- **Credit card skimming** and **ATM scams** have been reported, especially in tourist areas.\n- **Protests** and **demonstrations** can occur, especially in Panama City, and may affect travel plans.\n- **Wildlife encounters**, such as with snakes or spiders, can be a risk in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Health & Medical [/SECTION]\n- **Vaccinations:** Hepatitis A and typhoid fever vaccinations are recommended for travel to Panama.\n- **Water Safety:** Tap water is not safe to drink, and bottled or filtered water is recommended.\n- **Medical Facilities:** Modern medical facilities are available in Panama City and other major towns, but quality and availability may be limited in rural areas.
