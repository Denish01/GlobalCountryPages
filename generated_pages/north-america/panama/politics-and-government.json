The **president** serves as both the head of state and head of government, and is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The **National Assembly**, a unicameral legislature, is composed of 71 members who are also directly elected by the people for five-year terms. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of nine judges appointed by the president and confirmed by the National Assembly.\n\nThe political system in Panama is designed to provide **checks and balances** between the different branches of government, with the goal of preventing any one branch from becoming too powerful. The president has the power to appoint ministers and other high-ranking officials, but the National Assembly has the power to approve or reject these appointments. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has the power to declare laws and government actions unconstitutional.\n\nPanama's **unitary system** of government means that the central government has a high degree of control over the country's various regions and municipalities. However, the government has also implemented a number of **decentralization** initiatives in recent years, aimed at giving more power and autonomy to local governments.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Laurentino Cortizo | Head of state and head of government |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | President of the National Assembly | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Judicial review and interpretation of laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) | Center-left | Laurentino Cortizo | 30 | Largest party in the National Assembly |\n| Panameñista Party (PPA) | Center-right | José Isabel Blandón | 18 | Second-largest party in the National Assembly |\n| Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement (MOLIRENA) | Center-right | Francisco Millán | 5 | Third-largest party in the National Assembly |\n| People's Party (PP) | Center-left | Aníbal Martínez | 4 | Smaller party with representation in the National Assembly |\n| Independent | Independent | Various | 14 | Independents hold a significant number of seats in the National Assembly |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The **electoral system** in Panama is based on direct elections, with the president and members of the National Assembly elected by the people for five-year terms.\n- **Elections** are held every five years, with the most recent presidential election taking place in 2019.\n- The **last election** saw Laurentino Cortizo elected as president, with a turnout of over 70% of eligible voters.\n- The **next election** is scheduled to take place in 2024, with a number of candidates already announcing their intention to run.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Panama has a **high level of political stability**, with a strong tradition of democratic governance and respect for the rule of law.\n- However, the country still faces a number of **key challenges**, including corruption, inequality, and poverty.\n- The **current political climate** is characterized by a high degree of polarization, with debates over issues such as economic policy and social reform.\n- Panama's **regional dynamics** are also complex, with the country playing a key role in regional organizations such as the Central American Integration System (SICA).\n- The country has a **high level of freedom**, with a strong tradition of respect for human rights and the rule of law.\n- However, there are still **concerns about corruption** and the influence of organized crime in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Panama has a **long-standing relationship** with the United States, with the two countries cooperating on a range of issues including trade, security, and counter-narcotics.\n- The country is also a member of a number of **international organizations**, including the United Nations, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n- Panama has a **key role to play in regional trade**, with the country serving as a major hub for international commerce and trade.\n- The country has also **strengthened its ties** with other countries in the region, including Costa Rica and Colombia.\n- Panama has a **strong commitment to multilateralism**, with the country playing an active role in regional and international organizations.",
