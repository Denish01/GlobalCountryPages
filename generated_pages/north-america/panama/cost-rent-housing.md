[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Panama is relatively stable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with laws in place to regulate rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Panama's housing costs are relatively moderate, with Costa Rica being more expensive and Colombia being more affordable. The country's **strategic location** and **growing economy** have made it an attractive destination for expats and investors, driving up demand for housing and rental properties.

The Panamanian government has implemented various initiatives to promote **affordable housing** and regulate the rental market. For example, the **rent control law** limits annual rent increases to 10% of the previous year's rent. Additionally, the government has established programs to provide **subsidized housing** for low-income families and individuals. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Panama remains competitive, and renters should be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property. It's also essential to work with a reputable real estate agent and to thoroughly review the lease agreement before signing.
