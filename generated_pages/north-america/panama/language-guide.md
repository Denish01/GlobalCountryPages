[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Panama is dominated by Spanish, which is the official language and the primary means of communication for the vast majority of the population. However, there are also several regional dialects and minority languages spoken in Panama, including indigenous languages such as Kuna and Ngäbere, as well as English, which is widely spoken in tourist areas and among businesspeople. The English proficiency of Panamanians is moderate, with many people in the service industry and tourism sector speaking some English, but it is still a good idea to learn some basic Spanish phrases to communicate effectively. The Latin script is used to write Spanish, and the language belongs to the Romance language family, which also includes languages such as French, Italian, and Portuguese.

In addition to Spanish, there are also several indigenous languages spoken in Panama, including Kuna, which is spoken by the Kuna people, who live in the San Blas Islands, and Ngäbere, which is spoken by the Ngäbere people, who live in the western part of the country. These languages are an important part of Panama's cultural heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote them. English is also widely spoken in Panama, particularly in tourist areas and among businesspeople, and it is often used as a second language in international communication.

The use of language in Panama is also influenced by the country's history and cultural diversity. Many Panamanians have a mix of Spanish, African, and indigenous ancestry, and this is reflected in the language and customs of the country. For example, many Panamanians use African-influenced words and phrases in their everyday language, and the country's music and dance traditions also reflect its cultural diversity. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Panama is complex and diverse, with a mix of Spanish, indigenous languages, and English, as well as African and other cultural influences.
