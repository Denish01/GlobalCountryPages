The cost of living in Panama is driven up by the country's strategic location and the high demand for goods and services, particularly in Panama City. However, the country's **geographic location** allows for easy access to a wide range of fresh produce, which helps to keep prices down. Eating out is a popular culture in Panama, with many restaurants and cafes offering a range of local and international cuisine at affordable prices. However, home cooking is also common, and many Panamanians prefer to buy fresh ingredients at local markets to prepare traditional dishes.\n\nThe **inflation rate** in Panama is relatively low, at 0.7% in 2024, which helps to keep food prices stable. However, the cost of **health expenditure** and **education** can be high, which may impact the amount of money that people have available to spend on food. Despite this, Panama has a high **GDP per capita PPP** of $41,369, which suggests that many people have a relatively high disposable income to spend on food and other goods.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 5.25 PAB | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.00 | 7.00 PAB | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.80 | 6.30 PAB | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 4.20 PAB | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 21.00 PAB | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 35.00 PAB | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 10.50 PAB | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 5.25 PAB | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 3.50 PAB | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 2.80 PAB | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 28.00 PAB | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.20 | 4.20 PAB | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like sancocho or empanadas) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person, including drink) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | (3 courses, including drink) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | (upscale, including drink) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market.

Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have **fixed prices**, but they may offer **sales** and **promotions** on certain items.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **cheapest way to eat** is to buy food at local markets or street food stalls, where you can find traditional dishes like sancocho or empanadas for under $5 USD.\n- **Local staples** like rice, beans, and corn are good value and can be bought in bulk at low prices.\n- **Fresh produce** is widely available and relatively cheap, with many markets offering a wide range of fruits and vegetables.\n- **Avoid buying imported goods**, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local products.\n- **Try local specialties** like ceviche or tamales, which are delicious and affordable.\n- **Eat at local restaurants**, which offer a range of traditional dishes at affordable prices, and are a great way to experience the local culture.",
