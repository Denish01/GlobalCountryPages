  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Panama can vary, but on average, a medium-sized apartment of 85 square meters can expect to pay around $150-200 per month for basic utilities and $30-50 per month for internet.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($175 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($40 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: PAB\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nPanama has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most areas having access to reliable electricity, water, and gas services. However, costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity bills during the dry season (December to April) due to increased demand for air conditioning. The overall quality of utility services is generally good, but some areas may experience occasional power outages or water shortages. The country's inflation rate of 0.7% (2024) has helped keep utility costs relatively stable, but it's still important to monitor bills and adjust usage accordingly.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Panama can also vary depending on the region, with urban areas like Panama City tend to have higher costs than rural areas. Additionally, the type of accommodation can also impact utility costs, with apartments in high-rise buildings tend to have higher costs than houses or smaller apartments. It's worth noting that the government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of renewable energy sources, which may help reduce utility costs in the long run.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $60 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $15 | $25 | $35 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$105** | **$165** | **$235** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $25-35 | 10-20 Mbps | Cable & Wireless, Claro |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | Cable & Wireless, Claro |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Claro, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Claro, Digicel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Cable & Wireless, Claro |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8.99 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $9.99 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5-10 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's best to contact the providers directly, such as **EDMET** for electricity and **IDAAN** for water, and provide the necessary documentation, including proof of address and identification.\n- Consider using prepaid electricity plans, which can help you save money by monitoring your usage and avoiding surprise bills.\n- When choosing an internet provider, look for **Cable & Wireless** or **Claro**, which offer reliable and fast connections.\n- To save on utility bills, try to reduce your energy consumption by using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- Consider bundling your phone and internet services to get a better deal and simplify your billing process.",
