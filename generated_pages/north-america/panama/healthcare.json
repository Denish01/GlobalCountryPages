  "content": "Panama offers a mixed healthcare system with a combination of public and private hospitals, providing a relatively high standard of care, especially in urban areas like Panama City.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 4/5\nEmergency Number: 911\nHospital Standard: Excellent\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nPanama's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being largely funded by the government and the private system being driven by private insurance and out-of-pocket payments. The quality of care in Panama is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics having modern equipment and well-trained staff. However, there can be significant disparities in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas like Panama City having access to more advanced medical facilities and specialized care. The public healthcare system provides coverage for all citizens, including expats who have obtained residency, but the private system is often preferred by those who can afford it due to its higher standard of care and shorter wait times.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the public healthcare system, which includes a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. The public system provides a range of services, including emergency care, surgical services, and preventive care, but it can be overcrowded and underfunded, leading to long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private system offers a wider range of services, including specialized care and advanced medical procedures, but it can be expensive and may not be accessible to all.\n\nOverall, Panama's healthcare system is well-developed and provides a high standard of care, especially in urban areas. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including disparities in access to care and the need for increased funding and resources.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital Punta Pacifica | Panama City | Private | Cardiology, oncology, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Hospital Nacional | Panama City | Public | Emergency care, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinica Biblica | Panama City | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Hospital Chiriqui | David | Public | Emergency care, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Hospital Mae Lewis | Panama City | Private | Women's health, pediatrics, general medicine | Yes |\n| Centro Medico Paitilla | Panama City | Private | General medicine, surgery, specialty care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Private health insurance is recommended for expats and foreigners, as it provides access to better quality care and shorter wait times.\n- Local insurance options are available, including companies like ASSA and Pan American Life, which offer a range of plans and coverage options.\n- Coverage for expats is available, including plans that provide international coverage and emergency medical evacuation.\n- Costs for health insurance vary depending on the provider and the level of coverage, but can range from $50 to $500 per month.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, so it's worth checking with your employer to see what options are available.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are widely available in Panama, including prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n- Prescription requirements vary depending on the medication, but many medications are available without a prescription.\n- Common brands like **Johnson & Johnson** and **Pfizer** are widely available, as well as local brands and generics.\n- Costs for medications can vary, but many medications are relatively affordable, with prices similar to those in the US.\n- Pharmacists are generally well-trained and can provide advice on medications and health issues.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for travelers to Panama, especially those who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Malaria** and **dengue fever** are present in some areas of Panama, especially in rural areas, so precautions like insect repellent and mosquito nets are recommended.\n- **Zika** and **chikungunya** are also present in Panama, so pregnant women and others who are at risk should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- Water safety is a concern in some areas, especially in rural areas where water may not be treated, so it's recommended to drink bottled or filtered water.\n- Food safety is generally good in Panama, but it's still important to take precautions like washing your hands and avoiding undercooked meat and seafood.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Panama is a popular destination for medical tourism, with many hospitals and clinics offering specialized care and advanced medical procedures.\n- Popular procedures include **cosmetic surgery**, **orthopedic surgery**, and **dental care**, which can be significantly cheaper than in the US or other countries.\n- Accredited hospitals like Hospital Punta Pacifica and Clinica Biblica offer high-quality care and specialized services, and many have international accreditation and certification.\n- Cost savings can be significant, with some procedures costing 50-75% less than in the US or other countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In an emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- Ambulance services are available, but may not be reliable in all areas, so it's a good idea to have a plan in place in case of an emergency.\n- Nearest hospitals and clinics can be found online or through your hotel or tour operator.\n- Insurance claims can be complex, so it's a good idea to have a copy of your insurance policy and to contact your insurance provider as soon as possible in case of an emergency.\n- It's also a good idea to have a **personal emergency fund** in case of unexpected medical expenses.",
