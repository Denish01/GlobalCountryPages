[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Panama is generally a safe country to visit, with low levels of violent crime and a strong tourist infrastructure. The country has made significant strides in recent years to improve security and reduce crime rates. However, as with any travel destination, there are areas that are considered safer than others, and visitors should take normal precautions to protect themselves and their belongings. The capital city, Panama City, is a bustling metropolis with a mix of modern and historic neighborhoods, and visitors should be aware of their surroundings, especially at night.

Panama's safety record is also influenced by its geography and climate. The country is prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and hurricanes, which can affect travel plans and safety. Additionally, the border regions with Colombia and Costa Rica can be considered higher-risk areas due to the presence of organized crime groups and smuggling activities. However, these areas are generally not frequented by tourists, and the Panamanian government has implemented measures to improve security and cooperation with neighboring countries.
