# Panama History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Panama is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans over 10,000 years, from the earliest indigenous cultures to the modern-day nation, with key events including the construction of the Panama Canal, the country's independence from Colombia, and its emergence as a major economic hub in Central America.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Panama began with the arrival of indigenous peoples from Asia over 10,000 years ago, with the **Cueva de los Vientos** and **Cocle** cultures being two of the most notable pre-colonial civilizations. These early cultures developed complex societies, with their own systems of government, economy, and social hierarchy. The arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century marked the beginning of the colonial period, during which Panama became a major hub for trade and commerce, with the city of **Panama Viejo** being founded in 1519. The colonial period was marked by the exploitation of Panama's natural resources, as well as the introduction of African slaves and European diseases, which had a devastating impact on the indigenous population.

In the 19th century, Panama became a major player in the **Latin American independence movement**, with the country declaring its independence from Spain in 1821 and joining the **Gran Colombia**. However, this union was short-lived, and Panama eventually became part of Colombia in 1830. The construction of the **Panama Canal** in the late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a major turning point in the country's history, with the canal being completed in 1914 and becoming one of the most important waterways in the world. The canal's construction had a profound impact on Panama's economy and society, with the country becoming a major hub for international trade and commerce.

The 20th century saw Panama experience a series of **military coups** and **dictatorships**, including the regime of **Omar Torrijos**, who ruled the country from 1968 to 1981. The **United States invasion of Panama** in 1989 marked a major turning point in the country's history, with the invasion leading to the overthrow of **Manuel Noriega** and the establishment of a democratic government. Today, Panama is a **sovereign nation** with a growing economy and a rich cultural heritage, with the country continuing to play an important role in regional and international affairs.

In recent years, Panama has experienced significant economic growth, with the country becoming a major hub for finance, trade, and tourism. The **Panama Canal expansion** project, which was completed in 2016, has further solidified the country's position as a major player in international trade. However, Panama still faces a number of challenges, including **corruption** and **inequality**, which continue to be major concerns for the country's government and citizens.
