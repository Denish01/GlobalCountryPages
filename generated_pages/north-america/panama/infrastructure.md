[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Panama has made significant strides in developing its infrastructure, with a focus on improving transportation networks, energy generation, and telecommunications. The country has invested heavily in modernizing its road network, with a mix of highways, urban roads, and rural roads. However, there is still a notable urban-rural gap, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Recent investments in infrastructure development have been driven by the government's efforts to promote economic growth, improve living standards, and enhance the country's competitiveness.

The Panamanian government has implemented various initiatives to address the infrastructure gap, including public-private partnerships and foreign investment. These efforts have resulted in the development of new transportation projects, energy generation facilities, and telecommunications infrastructure. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services remains limited.

Panama's infrastructure development has also been influenced by its strategic location, with the Panama Canal being a major shipping route and a significant contributor to the country's economy. The canal's expansion, completed in 2016, has increased the country's capacity to handle larger ships and has boosted trade and economic activity.
