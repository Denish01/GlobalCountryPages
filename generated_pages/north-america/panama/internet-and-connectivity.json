The internet reliability in Panama is also relatively high, with few reports of frequent outages or disruptions, making it a good destination for remote workers and digital nomads.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, Panama has invested heavily in its telecommunications sector, with a focus on expanding coverage and improving speeds.

Additionally, many cafes, restaurants, and other public places offer free WiFi, making it easy to stay connected while on the go.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Panama is relatively straightforward, with several options available for tourists and visitors.

To buy a SIM card, you will typically need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some carriers may have additional requirements. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as this will ensure that you have access to the best coverage and speeds.\n\nWhen selecting a carrier, consider factors such as coverage, speed, and data limits, as well as any additional features or perks that may be included.
