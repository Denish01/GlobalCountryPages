  "content": "Panama's infrastructure is well-developed, with significant investments in recent years, particularly in the transportation and energy sectors, resulting in a relatively high standard of living and economic growth.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 94% of population\nInternet Penetration: 54%\nRoad Network: 15,137 km, with a mix of modern highways and rural roads\nRail Network: 355 km, primarily used for freight transport\nMajor Airports: 4 international, 20 domestic\nMajor Ports: 6, with the Panama Canal being a major shipping route\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nPanama has made significant strides in developing its infrastructure, with a focus on improving transportation networks, energy generation, and telecommunications. The country has invested heavily in modernizing its road network, with a mix of highways, urban roads, and rural roads. However, there is still a notable urban-rural gap, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. Recent investments in infrastructure development have been driven by the government's efforts to promote economic growth, improve living standards, and enhance the country's competitiveness.\n\nThe Panamanian government has implemented various initiatives to address the infrastructure gap, including public-private partnerships and foreign investment. These efforts have resulted in the development of new transportation projects, energy generation facilities, and telecommunications infrastructure. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services remains limited.\n\nPanama's infrastructure development has also been influenced by its strategic location, with the Panama Canal being a major shipping route and a significant contributor to the country's economy. The canal's expansion, completed in 2016, has increased the country's capacity to handle larger ships and has boosted trade and economic activity.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 15,137 km | Good | Modern highways connect major cities, while rural roads are often in poor condition |\n| Railways | 355 km | Moderate | Primarily used for freight transport, with limited passenger services |\n| Airports | 4 international, 20 domestic | Good | Major airports, such as Tocumen International Airport, offer modern facilities and services |\n| Ports | 6 major | Excellent | The Panama Canal is a major shipping route, with several ports along the canal and on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Panama's power generation mix is dominated by **hydroelectric power**, which accounts for approximately 60% of the country's electricity generation.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing **renewable energy** production, with a goal of reaching 70% of total energy production by 2050.\n- **Energy efficiency** measures have been implemented to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainable development.\n- Panama's power grid is relatively reliable, with an average of 2-3 **power outages** per year.\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote **energy access** in rural areas, where many communities lack access to electricity.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but may not be potable in rural areas.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** is a significant challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on **rainwater harvesting** or **wells**.\n- The government has implemented programs to improve **water quality** and increase access to **wastewater treatment** facilities.\n- **Water conservation** efforts are being promoted to reduce water waste and protect this vital resource.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic** networks are being expanded to increase **broadband** access and improve internet speeds.\n- **4G/5G rollout** is underway, with several mobile operators offering high-speed internet services.\n- **Postal services** are provided by the national postal service, Correos de Panamá.\n- **Internet penetration** is relatively low, with approximately 54% of the population having access to the internet.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Panama Canal expansion** project, completed in 2016, has increased the canal's capacity and boosted trade and economic activity.\n- The **Panama City Metro** project, which includes the construction of new metro lines and stations, aims to improve public transportation in the capital city.\n- The **Inter-American Highway** project, which will connect Panama to the rest of Central America, is expected to improve regional trade and economic integration.\n- The **Renewable Energy** project, which aims to increase renewable energy production, has received funding from international organizations and is expected to be completed by 2025.\n- The **Water and Sanitation** project, which aims to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, is being implemented in rural areas with funding from international donors.",
