  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Panama varies depending on the type of service and provider, with public healthcare services generally being more affordable than private ones, and health expenditure per capita averaging around $1,558 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,558 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 40.5% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: PAB\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nPanama's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, but it is more affordable and widely available. Locals often rely on the public system for basic care, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare services. The public system is funded through a combination of government funding and social security contributions, while private healthcare is typically paid out-of-pocket or through private insurance. Having health insurance is not mandatory in Panama, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help cover the costs of more complex medical procedures.\n\nThe healthcare system in Panama is generally well-equipped to handle basic medical needs, but it can be limited in terms of specialized care and advanced medical technology. Many doctors and medical professionals in Panama are trained in the US or Europe, and speak English, making it easier for foreigners to navigate the healthcare system. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, and between urban and rural areas. In general, private hospitals and clinics in Panama City and other major urban areas tend to offer higher quality care and more advanced medical technology than public facilities or those in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Basic medical care, hospital stays, and some procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Advanced medical care, specialized procedures, and full hospital coverage |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and brand\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and generally affordable, with prices starting at around $5\n- Many pharmacies in Panama are well-stocked and offer a wide range of medications, including some that may not be available in other countries\n- Prescription rules are generally similar to those in the US and Europe, with some medications requiring a doctor's prescription and others being available over-the-counter\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but can be limited in rural areas\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts or special promotions, especially for frequent customers or those with private insurance\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call 911 or go to the nearest hospital or emergency room. Many hospitals in Panama have 24-hour emergency services, and some may have specialized emergency departments, such as trauma centers or cardiac care units. Ambulance services are also available, but may not always be reliable or promptly available, especially in rural areas. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at a private hospital or clinic, as these tend to have better equipment and more English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Panama include the Hospital Punta Pacifica and the Clinica Hospital San Fernando, both of which are located in Panama City and offer a wide range of medical services, including emergency care.",
