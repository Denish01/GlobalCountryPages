# Best Time to Visit Panama — Month-by-Month Guide

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Panama has a tropical climate with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by clear skies, low humidity, and minimal rainfall. This period is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, birdwatching, and visiting the country's beautiful beaches. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by heavy rainfall, high humidity, and occasional hurricanes. During this time, some roads and attractions may be closed, and outdoor activities may be limited.

The country's climate varies across different regions, with the Pacific coast being generally drier than the Caribbean coast. The highlands, such as Boquete, have a cooler climate than the low-lying areas, making them a popular destination for those seeking to escape the heat. Understanding the seasons and climate zones is essential for planning a trip to Panama, as it can significantly impact the quality of your travel experience.

The dry season is the best time to visit Panama's popular attractions, such as the Panama Canal, the old town of Panama City, and the beautiful islands of Bocas del Toro. During this time, the weather is pleasant, and the crowds are smaller, making it easier to explore the country's rich history, culture, and natural beauty.
