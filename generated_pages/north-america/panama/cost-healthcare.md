[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Panama's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, but it is more affordable and widely available. Locals often rely on the public system for basic care, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare services. The public system is funded through a combination of government funding and social security contributions, while private healthcare is typically paid out-of-pocket or through private insurance. Having health insurance is not mandatory in Panama, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help cover the costs of more complex medical procedures.

The healthcare system in Panama is generally well-equipped to handle basic medical needs, but it can be limited in terms of specialized care and advanced medical technology. Many doctors and medical professionals in Panama are trained in the US or Europe, and speak English, making it easier for foreigners to navigate the healthcare system. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, and between urban and rural areas. In general, private hospitals and clinics in Panama City and other major urban areas tend to offer higher quality care and more advanced medical technology than public facilities or those in rural areas.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call 911 or go to the nearest hospital or emergency room. Many hospitals in Panama have 24-hour emergency services, and some may have specialized emergency departments, such as trauma centers or cardiac care units. Ambulance services are also available, but may not always be reliable or promptly available, especially in rural areas. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at a private hospital or clinic, as these tend to have better equipment and more English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Panama include the Hospital Punta Pacifica and the Clinica Hospital San Fernando, both of which are located in Panama City and offer a wide range of medical services, including emergency care.
