[SECTION] How Panama Is Divided [/SECTION]
Panama is divided into 10 provinces, each with its own provincial capital. The provinces are further divided into districts, corregimientos, and corregimientos are divided into barrios. Additionally, there are 3 indigenous regions, known as comarcas, which are autonomous territories with their own governance structures. The provinces and comarcas are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and they play a significant role in the country's governance and development. The 10 provinces of Panama are Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, Cocle, Colon, Darien, Herrera, Los Santos, Panama, Panama Oeste, and Veraguas.

The administrative structure of Panama is designed to provide a framework for the country's governance, economic development, and social services. The provinces and comarcas have a significant degree of autonomy, which allows them to manage their own affairs and make decisions that are in the best interest of their residents. The central government, on the other hand, is responsible for providing overall direction and guidance, as well as ensuring that the country's laws and policies are enforced consistently across all provinces and comarcas.
