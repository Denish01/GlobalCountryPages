[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic is easily accessible by air, with several international airports receiving direct flights from major hubs in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. The main entry points are Punta Cana International Airport (PUJ) and Santo Domingo Las Américas International Airport (SDQ), which offer a wide range of amenities and services, including currency exchange, restaurants, and car rental desks. Additionally, the country can be reached by land from Haiti, with several border crossings along the border, although this option is less common due to the limited road network and security concerns.

For those traveling from neighboring islands or other parts of the Caribbean, there are also ferry services and charter flights available, although these may be less frequent and more expensive than flying into one of the main airports. It's worth noting that the Dominican Republic has a well-developed tourism infrastructure, with many resorts and hotels offering shuttle services or private transfers from the airport, making it easy to get to your destination without having to worry about transportation.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights between major cities and tourist destinations. The main domestic airlines are **Dominican Wings** and **Air Century**, which operate flights from Santo Domingo to Punta Cana, Puerto Plata, and other destinations. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be high and availability limited. A one-way ticket can cost between $100 and $200, depending on the route and time of year. It's also worth considering booking a package deal that includes flights and accommodation, as these can often be more cost-effective than booking separately.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has no rail network, making it necessary to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around. This can make traveling between cities and towns more time-consuming and less convenient, especially for those who are used to the efficiency of train travel. However, the country's road network is relatively well-developed, with many major highways and roads connecting the main population centers and tourist destinations.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity routes and connecting major cities and towns. The main bus companies are **Caribe Tours** and **Expreso Bavaro**, which offer frequent departures and relatively comfortable seats. Prices are generally low, with a one-way ticket costing between $5 and $20, depending on the route and distance. However, the quality of the buses and roads can vary, and travel times can be long, especially on shorter routes where buses may stop frequently to pick up and drop off passengers.
