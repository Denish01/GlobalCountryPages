  "content": "To get around in the Dominican Republic, you can use a combination of taxis, buses, and rental cars, as well as domestic flights to travel between major cities and tourist destinations.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Punta Cana International Airport (PUJ), Santo Domingo Las Américas International Airport (SDQ)\nDomestic Air Network: moderate\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: Uber, local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe Dominican Republic is easily accessible by air, with several international airports receiving direct flights from major hubs in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. The main entry points are Punta Cana International Airport (PUJ) and Santo Domingo Las Américas International Airport (SDQ), which offer a wide range of amenities and services, including currency exchange, restaurants, and car rental desks. Additionally, the country can be reached by land from Haiti, with several border crossings along the border, although this option is less common due to the limited road network and security concerns.\n\nFor those traveling from neighboring islands or other parts of the Caribbean, there are also ferry services and charter flights available, although these may be less frequent and more expensive than flying into one of the main airports. It's worth noting that the Dominican Republic has a well-developed tourism infrastructure, with many resorts and hotels offering shuttle services or private transfers from the airport, making it easy to get to your destination without having to worry about transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe Dominican Republic has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights between major cities and tourist destinations. The main domestic airlines are **Dominican Wings** and **Air Century**, which operate flights from Santo Domingo to Punta Cana, Puerto Plata, and other destinations. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be high and availability limited. A one-way ticket can cost between $100 and $200, depending on the route and time of year. It's also worth considering booking a package deal that includes flights and accommodation, as these can often be more cost-effective than booking separately.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThe Dominican Republic has no rail network, making it necessary to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, to get around. This can make traveling between cities and towns more time-consuming and less convenient, especially for those who are used to the efficiency of train travel. However, the country's road network is relatively well-developed, with many major highways and roads connecting the main population centers and tourist destinations.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThe Dominican Republic has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity routes and connecting major cities and towns. The main bus companies are **Caribe Tours** and **Expreso Bavaro**, which offer frequent departures and relatively comfortable seats. Prices are generally low, with a one-way ticket costing between $5 and $20, depending on the route and distance. However, the quality of the buses and roads can vary, and travel times can be long, especially on shorter routes where buses may stop frequently to pick up and drop off passengers.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | Santo Domingo | $0.50 | Limited routes and hours |\n| City Bus | Major cities | $1-$2 | Frequent departures, variable quality |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10/km | Metered, but prices can be negotiated |\n| Ride-Hailing | Major cities | $5-$10 | Uber and local alternatives available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Some tourist areas | $5-$10 | Not a common mode of transport |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in the Dominican Republic, you will need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a credit card to rent a car.\n- The road quality in the Dominican Republic is moderate, with many major highways and roads connecting the main population centers and tourist destinations.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, with gasoline prices averaging around $1.50 per liter.\n- Car rental companies are widely available, especially at airports and in tourist areas, but be sure to research and compare prices before booking.\n- Hazards to watch out for include aggressive drivers, potholes, and pedestrians, especially in urban areas.\n- It's also a good idea to consider renting a car with a driver, especially if you're not comfortable driving in a foreign country or don't speak Spanish.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of scams and overcharging, especially when using taxis or ride-hailing services, and always agree on a price before starting your journey.\n- Use reputable bus companies and avoid traveling at night, especially on shorter routes where buses may stop frequently to pick up and drop off passengers.\n- Download the **Uber** app or a local alternative to get around major cities and tourist areas.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic laws, as fines can be steep and enforcement is becoming more common.\n- Consider purchasing travel insurance that covers transportation and medical emergencies, especially if you plan to engage in adventure activities or travel to remote areas.\n- Learn some basic Spanish phrases, such as \"¿Cuánto cuesta?\" (how much does it cost?) and \"¿Dónde está...?\" (where is...?), to help you navigate and communicate with locals.\n- Be patient and flexible when traveling, as transportation in the Dominican Republic can be unpredictable and subject to delays, especially during peak travel seasons.",
