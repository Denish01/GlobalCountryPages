[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most areas having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the summer months due to increased demand for electricity. The overall quality of the utility infrastructure is good, but there can be occasional outages and disruptions, especially during heavy rainfall or high winds. The cost of utilities is also affected by the country's inflation rate, which was 3.3% in 2024, and the GDP per capita PPP, which was $27,542 in 2024.

The cost of utilities in the Dominican Republic can also vary depending on the location, with cities like Santo Domingo and Punta Cana tend to have higher costs than rural areas. Additionally, the cost of utilities can be affected by the type of accommodation, with apartments and houses in gated communities tend to have higher costs than those in urban areas. It's worth noting that the country has a relatively high out-of-pocket health spend, with 25.1% of health expenditure per capita being paid out-of-pocket, which can affect the overall cost of living.
