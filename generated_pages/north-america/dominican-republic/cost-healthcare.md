[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has a mixed healthcare system, which combines public and private healthcare services. Public healthcare services are generally more affordable and accessible to locals, while private healthcare services cater to those who can afford to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance. For locals, the public healthcare system provides basic medical care, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries, at a relatively low cost. However, the quality of public healthcare services can vary significantly, and wait times can be long. For foreigners, private healthcare services are often the preferred option, as they offer higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost.

The need for insurance in the Dominican Republic is recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can add up quickly, and public healthcare services may not be sufficient to cover all medical needs. Many private hospitals and clinics require payment upfront, and having insurance can help alleviate the financial burden of medical expenses. Additionally, some private insurance plans may also cover medical evacuation to other countries, which can be essential in case of a serious medical emergency.
