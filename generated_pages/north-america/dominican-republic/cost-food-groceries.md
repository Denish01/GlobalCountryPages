[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in the Dominican Republic can be significant. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices ranging from 10-20% higher than those found at local markets. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and may have better quality control. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more authentic shopping experience, with fresh produce and local products available at competitive prices. It's worth noting that bargaining is a common practice at local markets, and visitors can often negotiate prices with vendors.

When shopping at local markets, it's best to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, as well as local products like coffee, chocolate, and rum. These products are often cheaper and of better quality than those found in supermarkets. Supermarkets, on the other hand, may be a better option for imported goods, such as dairy products, meat, and canned goods. It's also worth noting that some supermarkets may offer discounts and promotions, especially for bulk purchases.
