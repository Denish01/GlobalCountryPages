[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in the Dominican Republic is overseen by the Ministry of Education, with a focus on providing free and compulsory education to all citizens. Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, with limited resources and outdated infrastructure. However, there are some notable exceptions, such as the public universities, which are considered to be of high quality. The language of instruction is Spanish, although some private schools may offer English or other languages as a secondary option. Compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary school, and international schools are available for expatriates and those seeking a more global education.

The quality of education in the Dominican Republic can vary significantly depending on the institution and location. Private schools, particularly those in larger cities like Santo Domingo, tend to have better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum. International schools, on the other hand, often follow a foreign curriculum, such as the International Baccalaureate or the American curriculum, and may have a more diverse student body. These schools can provide a high-quality education, but often come with a higher price tag.
