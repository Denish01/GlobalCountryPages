  "content": "Healthcare in the Dominican Republic is a mixed system, combining public and private providers, with a range of options available for both locals and foreign visitors, but quality and accessibility can vary greatly depending on location and type of care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 911\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Dominican Republic's healthcare system is structured around a mix of public and private providers, with the public system primarily serving the local population and the private system catering to those who can afford it, including foreigners. The quality of care varies, with some private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality, modern facilities and equipment, while public hospitals often struggle with limited resources and outdated equipment. In urban areas, such as Santo Domingo, access to healthcare is generally better, with a range of options available, including specialized clinics and hospitals. In contrast, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare, with fewer options and longer travel times to reach medical facilities.\n\nThe public healthcare system in the Dominican Republic is generally considered to be underfunded and understaffed, which can result in long wait times and limited availability of specialized care. However, the private sector has seen significant investment in recent years, with many modern, well-equipped hospitals and clinics catering to the growing expat and tourist populations. Despite these improvements, the overall quality of care in the Dominican Republic is still considered to be lower than in many developed countries, and visitors are often advised to take out private health insurance to cover any medical expenses.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has made significant strides in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to care, particularly in rural areas. However, challenges remain, including a shortage of medical professionals, limited availability of specialized care, and inadequate infrastructure. As a result, visitors to the country are advised to take necessary precautions, including getting vaccinated before traveling and taking out private health insurance to cover any medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Centro Medico Dominicano | Santo
