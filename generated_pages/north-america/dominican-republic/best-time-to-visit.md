[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity and pleasant temperatures, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by high humidity and frequent rain showers. The country is divided into several climate zones, including a tropical zone in the low-lying areas and a subtropical zone in the mountainous regions. The climate varies significantly depending on the region, with the coastal areas being generally hotter and more humid than the mountainous regions.

The dry season is the best time to enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and water sports, as the weather is generally sunny and dry. The wet season, on the other hand, is better suited for indoor activities such as visiting museums, shopping, and relaxing at a resort. The seasons also affect the prices of accommodations and tourist services, with the dry season being the peak season and the wet season being the low season.

The Dominican Republic is also susceptible to hurricanes, which can occur from June to November. The country has a well-developed hurricane preparedness and response system, but it is still important for visitors to be aware of the risks and take necessary precautions.
