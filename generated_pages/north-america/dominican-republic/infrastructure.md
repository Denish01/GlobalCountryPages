[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has made significant strides in developing its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. The country has invested heavily in modernizing its infrastructure, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth. However, despite these efforts, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has implemented several initiatives aimed at bridging this gap, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities.

The country's infrastructure development is also driven by the tourism industry, which is a major contributor to the country's economy. The government has invested in improving the country's airports, ports, and transportation networks to facilitate the movement of tourists and goods. Additionally, the country has made significant progress in expanding its energy generation capacity, with a focus on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.

However, despite these advances, the country still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including a lack of access to basic services in rural areas, inadequate waste management, and a reliance on imported fuels. The government has recognized these challenges and has implemented several initiatives aimed at addressing them, including the development of new energy generation facilities, the expansion of the country's water and sanitation systems, and the improvement of the country's transportation networks.
