[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Dominican Republic is relatively active, with a mix of short-term and long-term rentals available. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, and deposit requirements are usually equivalent to one or two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Dominican Republic's **Ley de Arrendamientos** (Rent Law), which provides guidelines for rent increases, eviction procedures, and other aspects of the landlord-tenant relationship. Compared to its regional neighbors, the Dominican Republic's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in many Caribbean islands but higher than in some Central American countries.

The Dominican Republic's housing market is also influenced by the country's growing economy and tourism industry, which has led to an increase in demand for rental properties, particularly in popular tourist areas. As a result, prices for rentals and property purchases have risen in recent years, especially in areas with high demand. However, the market remains relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region, making it an attractive option for expats and foreign investors.
