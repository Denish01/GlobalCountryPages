[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has a well-developed transportation system, with various modes of transport available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major cities and towns. However, the quality of roads can vary, and traffic congestion is a common issue in larger cities like Santo Domingo. Most people get around using public buses or taxis, which are affordable and widely available.

In addition to public transportation, many locals also use **motoconchos** (motorcycle taxis) or **guaguas** (minibuses) to get around, especially in rural areas. These modes of transport are often cheaper than traditional taxis but may not be as safe. The government has also invested in improving the country's road network, with many highways and roads being upgraded or constructed in recent years.
