The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major cities and towns. However, the quality of roads can vary, and traffic congestion is a common issue in larger cities like Santo Domingo. Most people get around using public buses or taxis, which are affordable and widely available.\n\nIn addition to public transportation, many locals also use **motoconchos** (motorcycle taxis) or **guaguas** (minibuses) to get around, especially in rural areas. These modes of transport are often cheaper than traditional taxis but may not be as safe. The government has also invested in improving the country's road network, with many highways and roads being upgraded or constructed in recent years.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Good coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Limited routes, often crowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3-$5 | $1-$2 | $5-$10 | Be sure to agree on fare before starting journey |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$3 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Uber, Cabify available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, prices vary depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80-$1.20 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70-$1.10 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, prices vary depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Prices vary depending on route |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Frequent services, prices vary depending on bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Typical route, prices vary depending on airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider using public buses or **guaguas** instead of taxis or ride-hailing services.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure safety and fair prices.\n- Always agree on the fare before starting your journey, especially when using metered taxis.\n- Be aware of traffic congestion and plan your journey accordingly, especially during peak hours.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or intercity travel, as it can be more cost-effective than taking taxis or buses.\n- Use apps like **Google Maps** or **Waze** to navigate the roads and avoid traffic congestion.",
