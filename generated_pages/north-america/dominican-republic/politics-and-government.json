The **National Congress**, the country's legislature, is composed of two chambers: the **Senate** and the **Chamber of Deputies**. The Senate has 32 members, each representing one of the country's provinces, while the Chamber of Deputies has 183 members, elected by proportional representation.\n\nThe Dominican Republic's **electoral system** is based on universal suffrage, with all citizens over the age of 18 having the right to vote.
