        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The Dominican Republic is a sovereign country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea. The island was inhabited by the Taino people, an indigenous group, before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1496, Christopher Columbus's brother, Bartholomew Columbus, founded the first European settlement in the New World, La Navidad, on the northern coast of the island. The Spanish established the first permanent settlement, Santo Domingo, in 1498, which became the capital of the Spanish colony. The Dominican Republic declared its independence from Spain on February 27, 1844, after a long struggle led by Juan Pablo Duarte, Ramón Matías Mella, and Francisco del Rosario Sánchez.</p>
        <p>The country's early years of independence were marked by instability and conflict with neighboring Haiti, which had also gained independence from France in 1804. The two countries have a complex and often tumultuous relationship, with the Dominican Republic having been occupied by Haiti from 1822 to 1844. The Dominican Republic's independence was recognized by the United States in 1866, and the country has since maintained a complex relationship with its larger neighbor to the north.</p>
        <p>The Dominican Republic's history has been shaped by its strategic location in the Caribbean, with the country serving as a hub for trade and commerce in the region. The country's economy has been driven by agriculture, with sugar, tobacco, and coffee being major exports. The Dominican Republic has also been influenced by its cultural heritage, with a mix of Spanish, African, and indigenous Taino traditions shaping the country's music, art, and literature.</p>
        <p>In the 20th century, the Dominican Republic experienced a period of rapid economic growth and modernization, driven by tourism, remittances from abroad, and foreign investment. The country has also made significant progress in terms of human development, with improvements in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.</p>
