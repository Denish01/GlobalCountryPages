[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in the Dominican Republic is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, also known as **basic education**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 14 and lasts for 8 years. Secondary education, or **middle education**, is also compulsory and lasts for 2 years, after which students can choose to pursue a **baccalaureate** or a **technical** education. The quality of education in the Dominican Republic varies significantly between public and private institutions, with private schools generally offering higher quality education and better resources. Public schools, on the other hand, often face challenges such as overcrowding, lack of resources, and inadequate infrastructure.

The Dominican Republic has made significant progress in increasing access to education in recent years, with a significant increase in enrollment rates at all levels. However, the system still faces challenges such as high dropout rates, particularly among disadvantaged groups, and a shortage of qualified teachers. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including programs to improve teacher training and increase access to education for disadvantaged groups.

Despite these challenges, the education system in the Dominican Republic has produced many talented and successful individuals who have made significant contributions in various fields, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The system has also undergone significant reforms in recent years, aimed at improving the quality of education and increasing access to education for all.
