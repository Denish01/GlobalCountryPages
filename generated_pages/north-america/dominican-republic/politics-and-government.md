[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic's political system is based on the principles of **representative democracy**, where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The system is divided into three branches: the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial**, each with separate and independent powers. The **separation of powers** is designed to prevent any one branch from dominating the others, ensuring a system of **checks and balances**. The Dominican Republic is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and a single, unified system of laws.

The **presidential system** gives the President significant powers, including the ability to appoint ministers and other high-ranking officials. The President is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and has the power to negotiate and sign international treaties. The **National Congress**, the country's legislature, is composed of two chambers: the **Senate** and the **Chamber of Deputies**. The Senate has 32 members, each representing one of the country's provinces, while the Chamber of Deputies has 183 members, elected by proportional representation.

The Dominican Republic's **electoral system** is based on universal suffrage, with all citizens over the age of 18 having the right to vote. Elections are held regularly, with the President and members of the National Congress serving four-year terms. The country's **political parties** play a significant role in the electoral process, with several major parties competing for power.
