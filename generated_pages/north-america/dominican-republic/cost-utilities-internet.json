  "content": "The average cost of utilities and internet in the Dominican Republic can range from $150 to $300 per month for a medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and location.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($40 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: DOP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Dominican Republic has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most areas having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the summer months due to increased demand for electricity. The overall quality of the utility infrastructure is good, but there can be occasional outages and disruptions, especially during heavy rainfall or high winds. The cost of utilities is also affected by the country's inflation rate, which was 3.3% in 2024, and the GDP per capita PPP, which was $27,542 in 2024.\n\nThe cost of utilities in the Dominican Republic can also vary depending on the location, with cities like Santo Domingo and Punta Cana tend to have higher costs than rural areas. Additionally, the cost of utilities can be affected by the type of accommodation, with apartments and houses in gated communities tend to have higher costs than those in urban areas. It's worth noting that the country has a relatively high out-of-pocket health spend, with 25.1% of health expenditure per capita being paid out-of-pocket, which can affect the overall cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-40 | 10-20 Mbps | Claro, Orange |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-60 | 50-100 Mbps | Claro, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Claro, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10-20 GB | Claro, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $60-80 | varies | Claro, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's recommended to contact the local providers, such as Claro or Orange, and provide proof of address and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for those who want to control their energy consumption and avoid surprise bills.\n- The best internet providers in the Dominican Republic are Claro and Orange, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it's recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of seasonal promotions and discounts.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts or bundles.",
