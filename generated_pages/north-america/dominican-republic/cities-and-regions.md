[SECTION] How Dominican Republic Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces, each with its own provincial capital, and the National District, which encompasses the capital city of Santo Domingo. The provinces are further divided into municipalities, which are the basic administrative units of the country. This administrative structure allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while the central government maintains control over key areas such as foreign policy, defense, and national economic planning.

The division of the country into provinces and municipalities has historical roots, dating back to the colonial period. Over time, the provinces have developed distinct cultural and economic profiles, reflecting the diversity of the country's geography, climate, and natural resources. Understanding the administrative structure of the Dominican Republic is essential for navigating the country and appreciating the unique characteristics of each region.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
The Dominican Republic has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, buses, and taxis available throughout the country. The capital city of Santo Domingo is a major transportation hub, with flights and buses connecting to most major cities and tourist destinations. The country's roads are generally in good condition, making driving a viable option, especially for those who want to explore the countryside and get off the beaten path. However, traffic in the capital city and other urban areas can be heavy, and driving at night is not recommended due to poor road conditions and lack of street lighting.

For those who prefer not to drive, public transportation is a good option, with buses and taxis available throughout the country. The bus system is efficient and affordable, with routes connecting most major cities and towns. Taxis are also widely available, although they can be more expensive than buses. Additionally, many tourist destinations and resorts offer shuttle services and private transportation options, making it easy to get around without a car. [CALLOUT] Be sure to negotiate the price before getting into a taxi, as meters are not always used.
