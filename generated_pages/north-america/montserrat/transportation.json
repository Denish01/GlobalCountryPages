  "content": "To get around in Montserrat, you can use a combination of taxis, rental cars, and buses, as the island has a limited public transportation system and no rail network. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): John A. Osborne Airport, MNI\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe primary point of entry to Montserrat is the John A. Osborne Airport, which receives flights from neighboring islands such as Antigua and Barbuda. There are no direct flights from major international hubs, so travelers typically connect through airports in the Caribbean, such as V.C. Bird International Airport in Antigua or Princess Juliana International Airport in St. Maarten. The airport in Montserrat is small and offers limited facilities, but it provides a convenient entry point for visitors.\n\nTo get to Montserrat, you can fly into the John A. Osborne Airport from Antigua, which is a common gateway to the island. From Antigua, you can take a ferry or a flight to Montserrat. The ferry ride takes around 4-5 hours, while flights are much quicker, taking around 20 minutes. There are no overland entry points to Montserrat, as it is an island territory. Visitors can also arrive by private boat or yacht, but they must clear customs and immigration upon arrival.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nMontserrat has a limited domestic air network, with most flights connecting the island to neighboring Antigua and Barbuda. The main airline operating in the region is FlyMontserrat, which offers regular flights between Montserrat and Antigua. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons. The cost of a one-way ticket from Antigua to Montserrat can range from $100 to $200, depending on the time of year and availability. \n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nMontserrat has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the island. The lack of a rail system is due to the island's small size and limited population, making it more practical to rely on road transportation. As a result, visitors must use alternative modes of transportation, such as taxis, buses, or rental cars, to get around the island.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThe public bus system in Montserrat is limited, with most buses operating on a fixed route between the capital town of Brades and other villages on the island. The buses are not very frequent, and the service can be unreliable, so it's best to plan ahead and check the schedule in advance. The cost of a bus ride is around $1-$2, making it a relatively affordable option for getting around. However, the buses may not be the most convenient option for visitors, especially those with limited time on the island.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | none | n/a | Montserrat has no metro or subway system |\n| City Bus | Brades, other villages | $1-$2 | Limited service and frequency |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $10-$20 | Available at the airport and in towns |\n| Ride-Hailing | limited | $10-$20 | Local alternatives such as island taxis |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | none | n/a | Not available in Montserrat |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Montserrat, you need a valid driver's license from your home country or an international driver's license.\n- The road quality in Montserrat is moderate, with some roads being narrow and winding, especially in the hills.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high in Montserrat, so it's essential to factor this into your budget when renting a car.\n- Car rental companies are available at the airport and in the capital town of Brades, offering a range of vehicles from economy cars to SUVs.\n- Hazards on the road include steep hills, sharp curves, and pedestrians, so drivers need to be cautious and alert.\n- It's also important to note that driving is on the left-hand side of the road in Montserrat, which may require some adjustment for visitors from countries where driving is on the right-hand side.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of the limited public transportation options and plan ahead to ensure you have a reliable way to get around the island.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or rental car services to avoid scams and ensure your safety.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to minimize the risk of accidents.\n- Download local transportation apps or maps to help navigate the island and find the best routes.\n- Be prepared for occasional **traffic congestion** in the capital town of Brades, especially during rush hour.\n- Consider renting a 4x4 vehicle if you plan to explore the island's rugged terrain and hills.\n- Keep some cash on hand, as not all transportation providers accept credit or debit cards.\n- Respect local customs and traditions, especially when interacting with taxi drivers or other transportation providers.",
