# The Truth About Montserrat - History & Real Facts

Most people are unaware of the complex history, unique cultural heritage, and ongoing challenges faced by the island territory of Montserrat, which has been a British overseas territory since 1632.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Montserrat was first inhabited by the indigenous **Arawak** people, who migrated to the island from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. The island was discovered by **Christopher Columbus** in 1493, and it was named after the **Santa Maria de Montserrate** monastery in Catalonia, Spain. In 1632, the island was colonized by English settlers, who established the first permanent settlement at **Plymouth**. Montserrat remained a British colony throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, with the British government exercising control over the island's internal and external affairs.

During the 20th century, Montserrat, like many other British colonies, began to push for greater autonomy and self-governance. In 1960, the island was granted **associated statehood**, which gave it a degree of internal self-governance while the British government retained responsibility for defense and foreign affairs. However, Montserrat did not pursue full independence, and it remains a British overseas territory to this day. In 1995, the island was devastated by a series of volcanic eruptions, which forced the evacuation of the capital city, Plymouth, and led to a significant decline in the island's population.

The **Soufrière Hills volcano** remains active, and the island is still recovering from the devastating effects of the eruptions. The British government has provided significant financial and logistical support to help the island recover and rebuild. Today, Montserrat is a **British overseas territory**, with a population of approximately 4,386 people and a total area of 102 square kilometers. The island has a **parliamentary democracy** system, with a premier and a legislative council.

The island's history and cultural heritage are reflected in its architecture, music, and art. The **Plymouth Museum** showcases the island's history, while the **Montserrat National Trust** works to preserve the island's natural and cultural heritage. The island's **cuisine** is a fusion of British, African, and Caribbean influences, with popular dishes such as **goat water** and **pepper pot soup**.
