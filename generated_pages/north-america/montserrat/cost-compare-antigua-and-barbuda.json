  "content": "Montserrat is generally cheaper than Antigua and Barbuda, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMontserrat GDP per Capita (PPP): 13,780\nAntigua and Barbuda GDP per Capita (PPP): 24,029\nMontserrat Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nAntigua and Barbuda Inflation Rate: 3.1%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Montserrat\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Montserrat vs Antigua and Barbuda [/SECTION]\nMontserrat and Antigua and Barbuda are two neighboring island territories in the Caribbean, with distinct economic profiles. Montserrat, a British overseas territory, has a smaller population and a more limited economy, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Antigua and Barbuda is an independent nation with a more developed tourism industry, which drives up prices for accommodations, food, and other services. As a result, Montserrat is generally cheaper than Antigua and Barbuda, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower. This makes Montserrat an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable Caribbean lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Montserrat's economy is largely driven by agriculture, fishing, and remittances from abroad, while Antigua and Barbuda's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on tourism, financial services, and manufacturing. This diversification has led to higher prices in Antigua and Barbuda, particularly in the capital city of St. John's. However, Montserrat's smaller size and more limited economy also mean that it has fewer amenities and services available, which can be a drawback for some residents.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montserrat (USD) | Antigua and Barbuda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 300 | 450 | 33% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 1,200 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montserrat (USD) | Antigua and Barbuda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 20 | 25% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 400 | 25% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 4 | 25% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montserrat (USD) | Antigua and Barbuda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.50 | 2.50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.00 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montserrat (USD) | Antigua and Barbuda (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 70 | 29% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Montserrat (USD) | Antigua and Barbuda (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Montserrat is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 30-40% lower than in Antigua and Barbuda\n- Food and dining, with meal prices that are 25-30% lower\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices that are 20-40% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices that are 20-30% lower\n- **Antigua and Barbuda is cheaper for:**\n- Luxury goods and high-end services, which are more widely available in Antigua and Barbuda\n- Air travel, with a larger international airport and more frequent flights\n- Entertainment and leisure activities, with a wider range of options available\n- Shopping, with a larger selection of stores and markets\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nMontserrat and Antigua and Barbuda offer distinct lifestyles and cost of living profiles, making them suitable for different types of residents.
