[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Montserrat's housing market is relatively small and limited, with a high demand for rentals, particularly in the **city center** of Brades, which has become the de facto capital since the volcanic eruption in 1997. The typical lease term is one to two years, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Restriction Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Antigua and Barbuda, Montserrat's housing costs are relatively moderate, although the limited supply and high demand can drive up prices.

The housing market in Montserrat is also influenced by the island's **volcanic history**, which has led to a shift in population and development towards the north. As a result, areas such as Brades, Cork Hill, and Salem have seen an increase in housing construction and rentals. However, the market remains relatively **unregulated**, and tenants should be cautious when signing leases and ensure they understand their rights and responsibilities. The cost of living in Montserrat is also relatively high, due to the island's dependence on imports and limited economic activity.
