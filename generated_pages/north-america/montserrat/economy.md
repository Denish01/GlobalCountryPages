[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Montserrat has a small, open economy that is heavily reliant on imports and foreign investment. The island's economy is classified as upper-middle income, with a relatively high GDP per capita compared to other Caribbean territories. The economy has been growing steadily in recent years, driven by a rebound in tourism and construction activity. However, the island's economic development is still hindered by its small size, limited natural resources, and vulnerability to natural disasters.

The government of Montserrat has been working to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on a few key sectors. This includes initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, improve the business environment, and attract foreign investment. Despite these efforts, the economy remains fragile and is susceptible to external shocks, such as changes in the global economy or natural disasters.

Montserrat's economy is also closely tied to the United Kingdom, which provides significant financial support to the island. The UK has provided funding for various development projects, including infrastructure upgrades and social programs. This support has helped to stabilize the economy and promote economic growth, but it also means that Montserrat's economy is closely linked to the UK's economic fortunes.
