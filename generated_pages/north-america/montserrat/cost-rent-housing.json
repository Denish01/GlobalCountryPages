The typical lease term is one to two years, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Restriction Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Antigua and Barbuda, Montserrat's housing costs are relatively moderate, although the limited supply and high demand can drive up prices.\n\nThe housing market in Montserrat is also influenced by the island's **volcanic history**, which has led to a shift in population and development towards the north. As a result, areas such as Brades, Cork Hill, and Salem have seen an increase in housing construction and rentals. However, the market remains relatively **unregulated**, and tenants should be cautious when signing leases and ensure they understand their rights and responsibilities. The cost of living in Montserrat is also relatively high, due to the island's dependence on imports and limited economic activity.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $500-$700 | $350-$550 | basic amenities, shared kitchen/bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$900 | $450-$700 | standard apartment, separate kitchen/bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $900-$1,400 | $700-$1,100 | family-sized apartment, full kitchen/bathroom |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $900-$1,400 | spacious apartment, multiple bedrooms/bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$3,500 | prime locations, close to amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,800-$2,800 | residential areas, some amenities nearby |\n| Rural | $1,000-$1,800 | rural areas, limited amenities, scenic views |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Brades: $800-$1,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, modern amenities, and a vibrant community\n- Cork Hill: $600-$1,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, scenic views, and a quiet atmosphere\n- Salem: $500-$900 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, historic charm, and a close-knit community\n- Old Towne: $400-$800 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, historic architecture, and a lively atmosphere\n- Woodlands: $350-$700 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, rural setting, and a peaceful environment\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Montserrat [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and landlords thoroughly to avoid **scams** and ensure a safe and secure living environment\n- Work with a reputable **real estate agent** to find a suitable rental property\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms carefully, and ensure you understand all **fees** and **charges**\n- Check the property's **condition** and **maintenance** before signing a lease\n- Consider **furnished** apartments, as they can be more convenient and cost-effective\n- Be prepared for **utility costs**, such as electricity and water, which are typically not included in the rent",
