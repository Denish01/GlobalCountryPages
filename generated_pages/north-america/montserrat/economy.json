  "content": "Montserrat's economy is driven by a mix of tourism, financial services, and agriculture, with a strong focus on rebuilding and development after the devastating volcanic eruptions in the 1990s. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($0.06 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($13,870 estimate)\nIncome Classification: Upper-Middle\nMain Industries: Tourism, Financial Services, Agriculture\nCurrency: XCD\nUnemployment Rate: (6% approximate)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 76 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nMontserrat has a small, open economy that is heavily reliant on imports and foreign investment. The island's economy is classified as upper-middle income, with a relatively high GDP per capita compared to other Caribbean territories. The economy has been growing steadily in recent years, driven by a rebound in tourism and construction activity. However, the island's economic development is still hindered by its small size, limited natural resources, and vulnerability to natural disasters.\n\nThe government of Montserrat has been working to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on a few key sectors. This includes initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, improve the business environment, and attract foreign investment. Despite these efforts, the economy remains fragile and is susceptible to external shocks, such as changes in the global economy or natural disasters.\n\nMontserrat's economy is also closely tied to the United Kingdom, which provides significant financial support to the island. The UK has provided funding for various development projects, including infrastructure upgrades and social programs. This support has helped to stabilize the economy and promote economic growth, but it also means that Montserrat's economy is closely linked to the UK's economic fortunes.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tourism | 30% | The tourism sector is a significant contributor to Montserrat's economy, with visitors drawn to the island's natural beauty and unique culture. |\n| Financial Services | 20% | Montserrat has a well-developed financial services sector, with several international banks and financial institutions operating on the island. |\n| Agriculture | 15% | Agriculture is a smaller but still important sector, with crops such as bananas, mangoes, and vegetables being grown for both domestic consumption and export. |\n| Construction | 15% | The construction sector is a significant employer and contributor to the economy, with many projects focused on rebuilding and developing the island's infrastructure. |\n| Manufacturing | 10% | The manufacturing sector is relatively small, but includes companies producing goods such as textiles, electronics, and food products. |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Electronics**, such as computers and telecommunications equipment\n- **Food products**, including fruit, vegetables, and meat\n- **Textiles**, such as clothing and fabrics\n- **Chemicals**, including pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals\n- **Machinery**, including equipment for the construction and manufacturing sectors\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food products**, including grains, dairy products, and meat\n- **Machinery**, including equipment for the construction and manufacturing sectors\n- **Transportation equipment**, including cars, trucks, and buses\n- **Electronics**, such as computers and telecommunications equipment\n- **Chemicals**, including pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- United Kingdom\n- United States\n- Antigua and Barbuda\n- Guadeloupe\n- Ireland\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The island has a well-developed road network, with several main roads connecting the major towns and villages.\n- The airport, John A.

The tourism sector is expected to remain a key driver of growth, with several new hotels and resorts under development. The financial services sector is also expected to continue to grow, with several new companies setting up operations on the island.\n\nHowever, the economy still faces several challenges, including its vulnerability to natural disasters and its reliance on a few key sectors. The government is working to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on imports, but this will require significant investment in infrastructure and human capital. Several major projects are underway, including the development of a new port and the expansion of the airport, which are expected to support economic growth and development in the coming years.",
