Road Network: 40 km, paved and well-maintained
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 1
Major Ports: 1
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Montserrat's infrastructure has undergone significant development and improvement in recent years, driven by investments from the UK government and international organizations. The island's geography, with its volcanic terrain and steep slopes, poses challenges to infrastructure development, but the government has made efforts to upgrade and expand its systems. The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is relatively narrow, with most residents having access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in terms of internet penetration and mobile coverage.

The government of Montserrat has implemented various initiatives to enhance the island's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, the upgrade of the airport, and the development of renewable energy sources. These efforts aim to support the island's economic growth, improve the quality of life for residents, and enhance its attractiveness to tourists. Despite these advancements, Montserrat's infrastructure remains vulnerable to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and volcanic eruptions, which can cause significant damage and disruption to essential services.

The island's infrastructure development is also influenced by its relationship with the UK, which provides financial and technical assistance to support the island's growth and development. This partnership has enabled Montserrat to access expertise, funding, and resources that might not be available otherwise, and has helped to drive progress in areas such as energy, transportation, and telecommunications.
