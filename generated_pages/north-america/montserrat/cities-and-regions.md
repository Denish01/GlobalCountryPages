[SECTION] How Montserrat Is Divided [/SECTION]
Montserrat is divided into three parishes: Saint Anthony, Saint Georges, and Saint Peter. Each parish has its own unique character and plays a distinct role in the island's economy and culture. The parishes are not further subdivided into smaller administrative units, and the island's small size means that many services and amenities are centralized in the main towns. The government of Montserrat is responsible for providing services and infrastructure to all parts of the island, regardless of parish boundaries.

The island's division into parishes is largely historical and reflects the island's colonial past. The parishes were established by the British colonial authorities, and each one has its own church and other community facilities. Today, the parishes continue to play an important role in the island's social and cultural life, with many community events and festivals taking place at the parish level.
