The population of Montserrat has been affected by several factors, including volcanic eruptions and economic challenges. In 1997, a volcanic eruption forced the evacuation of the capital city, Plymouth, and many residents were relocated to other parts of the island or abroad. This has had a significant impact on the population, with many young people leaving the island in search of better economic opportunities. Despite these challenges, the population of Montserrat remains resilient, with a strong sense of community and cultural identity.

The population of Montserrat is also affected by migration patterns, with many people moving to the island for work or to join family members.
