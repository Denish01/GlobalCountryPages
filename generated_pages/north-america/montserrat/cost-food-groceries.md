Food prices in Montserrat are generally higher than the regional average due to the island's remote location and reliance on imports. The cost of living in Montserrat is driven up by the high cost of transportation, which affects the prices of groceries and other essential items.

However, home cooking is also a common practice, especially among locals who prefer to buy fresh produce from the market and cook traditional dishes.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Montserrat can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, especially for imported items, while local markets offer fresh produce at lower prices. However, the quality and variety of products may be limited at local markets. It's recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while opting for supermarkets for packaged goods and imported items.

When shopping at local markets, it's essential to **haggle** and negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases. Vendors often expect customers to bargain, and it's a common practice in Montserrat. On the other hand, supermarkets have fixed prices, and bargaining is not an option. To save money, it's best to shop at local markets for essentials like produce, meat, and dairy products, while opting for supermarkets for non-essential items.
