[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Montserrat has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity and moderate temperatures, making it the best time to visit the island. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by high humidity and heavy rainfall, with the most significant risk of hurricanes occurring between September and November. The island's climate is also influenced by its location in the **Leeward Islands**, where the trade winds bring warm air from the equator. The **tropical climate** means that temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year, with average highs ranging from 77°F to 88°F (25°C to 31°C).

The dry season is the best time to enjoy outdoor activities such as **hiking**, **swimming**, and **snorkeling**, as the weather is generally calm and sunny. In contrast, the wet season can make it difficult to engage in these activities due to the heavy rainfall and strong winds. However, the wet season is also a time of **renewal** and **growth**, as the rain brings new life to the island's **flora** and **fauna**. Visitors who don't mind the rain can still enjoy the island's **natural beauty**, including its **waterfalls**, **hot springs**, and **rainforests**.

The seasons also affect the island's **tourism industry**, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, **hotels** and **resorts** are fully booked, and **tour operators** offer a wide range of activities and tours. In contrast, the wet season is the low season, and many **tourist facilities** may be closed or operate on reduced hours. However, visitors who come during the wet season can often find **discounts** and **special offers**, making it a good time to visit for those on a **budget**.
