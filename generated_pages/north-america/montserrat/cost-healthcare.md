[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Montserrat's healthcare system is a mix of public and private services, with the government providing basic healthcare to all residents, including foreigners, through the Montserrat Hospital and several health centers. However, the quality of public healthcare can be limited, and wait times for specialized care can be long, which is why many people choose to use private healthcare services, which are generally of higher quality but more expensive. Locals and foreigners can access both public and private healthcare services, but foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for private care or have private insurance to cover the costs.

The healthcare system in Montserrat is generally well-organized, with a range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and specialist consultations. However, the system can be limited by the island's small size and remote location, which can make it difficult to access specialized care or emergency services. As a result, many people choose to travel to other islands or countries for medical care, which can be expensive and may require private insurance. It is recommended that visitors and residents have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare in Montserrat can be high, especially for private services.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or visit the emergency room at the Montserrat Hospital.

For more serious emergencies, medical evacuation to another island or country may be necessary, which can be expensive and may require private insurance.
