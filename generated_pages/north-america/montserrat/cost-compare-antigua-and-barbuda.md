[SECTION] Overview: Montserrat vs Antigua and Barbuda [/SECTION]
Montserrat and Antigua and Barbuda are two neighboring island territories in the Caribbean, with distinct economic profiles. Montserrat, a British overseas territory, has a smaller population and a more limited economy, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Antigua and Barbuda is an independent nation with a more developed tourism industry, which drives up prices for accommodations, food, and other services. As a result, Montserrat is generally cheaper than Antigua and Barbuda, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower. This makes Montserrat an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable Caribbean lifestyle.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Montserrat's economy is largely driven by agriculture, fishing, and remittances from abroad, while Antigua and Barbuda's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on tourism, financial services, and manufacturing. This diversification has led to higher prices in Antigua and Barbuda, particularly in the capital city of St. John's. However, Montserrat's smaller size and more limited economy also mean that it has fewer amenities and services available, which can be a drawback for some residents.
