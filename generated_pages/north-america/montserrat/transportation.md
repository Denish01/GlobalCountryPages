[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The primary point of entry to Montserrat is the John A. Osborne Airport, which receives flights from neighboring islands such as Antigua and Barbuda. There are no direct flights from major international hubs, so travelers typically connect through airports in the Caribbean, such as V.C. Bird International Airport in Antigua or Princess Juliana International Airport in St. Maarten. The airport in Montserrat is small and offers limited facilities, but it provides a convenient entry point for visitors.

To get to Montserrat, you can fly into the John A. Osborne Airport from Antigua, which is a common gateway to the island. From Antigua, you can take a ferry or a flight to Montserrat. The ferry ride takes around 4-5 hours, while flights are much quicker, taking around 20 minutes. There are no overland entry points to Montserrat, as it is an island territory. Visitors can also arrive by private boat or yacht, but they must clear customs and immigration upon arrival.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Montserrat has a limited domestic air network, with most flights connecting the island to neighboring Antigua and Barbuda. The main airline operating in the region is FlyMontserrat, which offers regular flights between Montserrat and Antigua. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons. The cost of a one-way ticket from Antigua to Montserrat can range from $100 to $200, depending on the time of year and availability. 

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Montserrat has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the island. The lack of a rail system is due to the island's small size and limited population, making it more practical to rely on road transportation. As a result, visitors must use alternative modes of transportation, such as taxis, buses, or rental cars, to get around the island.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
The public bus system in Montserrat is limited, with most buses operating on a fixed route between the capital town of Brades and other villages on the island. The buses are not very frequent, and the service can be unreliable, so it's best to plan ahead and check the schedule in advance. The cost of a bus ride is around $1-$2, making it a relatively affordable option for getting around. However, the buses may not be the most convenient option for visitors, especially those with limited time on the island.
