  "content": "The history of Montserrat is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans from the earliest known indigenous inhabitants to its current status as a British Overseas Territory.\n\n[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]\nThe island of Montserrat has been inhabited since the pre-Columbian era, with the first recorded inhabitants being the **Arawak** people, an indigenous group that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1493, **Christopher Columbus** sighted the island on his second voyage to the New World, and it was later colonized by English settlers in 1632. The English established a **sugar plantation** economy, which relied heavily on the labor of enslaved Africans. The island changed hands several times between the English and French during the 17th and 18th centuries, with the English ultimately gaining control in 1632. During the 19th century, Montserrat became a major producer of **sugar**, **cotton**, and **tobacco**, with the island's economy relying heavily on these crops.
