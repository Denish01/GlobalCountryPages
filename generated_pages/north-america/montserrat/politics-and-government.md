[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Montserrat's political system is based on the principles of a constitutional monarchy, with the King of the United Kingdom serving as the head of state. The monarch is represented in Montserrat by the Governor, who is appointed by the British monarch on the advice of the British government. The head of government is the Premier, who is the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Premier is responsible for advising the Governor on the exercise of the royal prerogative and for overseeing the administration of the government. The Legislative Assembly is a unicameral body, composed of 11 members who are elected by universal adult suffrage for a term of five years. The Assembly is responsible for making laws for the peace, order, and good government of Montserrat.

The government of Montserrat is divided into three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The executive branch is headed by the Premier and is responsible for the administration of the government. The legislative branch is composed of the Legislative Assembly, which is responsible for making laws. The judicial branch is composed of the courts, which are responsible for interpreting the laws and resolving disputes. The system of government in Montserrat is based on the principles of the **separation of powers**, which provides for a system of checks and balances between the three branches of government.

The government of Montserrat is also guided by the principles of **representative democracy**, which provides for the representation of the people of Montserrat in the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is elected by the people of Montserrat, and its members are responsible for representing the interests of their constituents. The government of Montserrat is also accountable to the people, and is required to provide regular reports on its activities and to answer questions from the public.
