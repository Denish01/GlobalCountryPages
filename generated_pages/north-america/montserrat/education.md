The education system in Montserrat is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education is compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 11, and is provided by seven government-run primary schools. Secondary education is also compulsory, and is provided by two government-run secondary schools, which offer a range of subjects and prepare students for the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) exams. Tertiary education is not available on the island, and students who wish to pursue higher education must do so abroad, often in the United Kingdom or other Caribbean islands.

The quality of education in Montserrat is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and a range of extracurricular activities. The education system is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards and overseeing the administration of schools. While there are some private schools on the island, the majority of students attend government-run schools, which are free and open to all residents.

The education system in Montserrat faces some challenges, including limited resources and a lack of opportunities for tertiary education. However, the government has made efforts to improve the system in recent years, including the introduction of new curriculum standards and the provision of training and support for teachers. Despite these challenges, the education system in Montserrat provides students with a solid foundation for future success, and many students go on to pursue higher education and careers abroad.
