The main transportation modes on the island are **taxi services**, **rental cars**, and **minibus services**. The quality of public transit is limited, but most people get around using taxis or private vehicles. The island has a few main roads, and traffic is generally light, making it easy to navigate.\n\nThe island's small size and limited public transportation options mean that many residents and visitors rely on private vehicles or taxis to get around. However, there are some minibus services available, particularly in the capital city of **Plymouth**. These services can be a more affordable option for short trips, but they may not be as frequent or reliable as taxi services.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2-$3 | $50-$70 | Limited coverage, mostly in Plymouth |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $3-$5 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly in Plymouth |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $10-$15 | $2-$3 | $15-$25 | Available throughout the island |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $50-$70 | To Plymouth, can be arranged through taxi services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Can vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10-$1.30 | Can vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, can vary depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options, can vary depending on location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, no toll roads on the island |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus | N/A | Not available, island is small and most transportation is local |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available, no domestic flights |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available, no train services on the island |\n| Ferry to Antigua | $50-$100 | Can be arranged through private operators |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using minibus services or sharing a taxi with other passengers.\n- Be sure to agree on a fare with your taxi driver before starting your journey, as some drivers may not use meters.\n- Consider renting a car for the day to explore the island, as public transportation options can be limited.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas.\n- Use reputable taxi services or rental agencies to ensure your safety and security.\n- Download maps or guidebooks to help navigate the island, as some areas may not have reliable internet or GPS coverage.",
