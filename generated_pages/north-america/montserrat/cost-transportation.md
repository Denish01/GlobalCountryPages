[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Montserrat is a small island territory in the Caribbean, and getting around can be relatively easy. The main transportation modes on the island are **taxi services**, **rental cars**, and **minibus services**. The quality of public transit is limited, but most people get around using taxis or private vehicles. The island has a few main roads, and traffic is generally light, making it easy to navigate.

The island's small size and limited public transportation options mean that many residents and visitors rely on private vehicles or taxis to get around. However, there are some minibus services available, particularly in the capital city of **Plymouth**. These services can be a more affordable option for short trips, but they may not be as frequent or reliable as taxi services.
