  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Montserrat can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but with potentially longer wait times and less specialized care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,243\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 15.6%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XCD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMontserrat's healthcare system is a mix of public and private services, with the government providing basic healthcare to all residents, including foreigners, through the Montserrat Hospital and several health centers. However, the quality of public healthcare can be limited, and wait times for specialized care can be long, which is why many people choose to use private healthcare services, which are generally of higher quality but more expensive. Locals and foreigners can access both public and private healthcare services, but foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for private care or have private insurance to cover the costs.\n\nThe healthcare system in Montserrat is generally well-organized, with a range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and specialist consultations. However, the system can be limited by the island's small size and remote location, which can make it difficult to access specialized care or emergency services. As a result, many people choose to travel to other islands or countries for medical care, which can be expensive and may require private insurance. It is recommended that visitors and residents have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare in Montserrat can be high, especially for private services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics are generally less expensive, but may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may have more experience and better equipment, but are more expensive |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Private dental clinics may offer more advanced treatments and better equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have limited eye care services, while private clinics may offer more comprehensive exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Private labs may offer faster results and more advanced testing, but are more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public hospital emergency room visits may be less expensive, but may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable rooms and better amenities, but are more expensive |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons and better equipment, but are more expensive |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Public hospitals may have less expensive delivery services, but may have fewer amenities |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Private hospitals may offer more advanced imaging services, but are more expensive |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Public hospitals may have less expensive imaging services, but may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public hospital visits, basic medical care, and some prescriptions |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private hospital visits, specialist consultations, and advanced medical care |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be expensive in Montserrat, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 or more per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medication is generally less expensive, with prices ranging from $5 to $20\n- Pharmacies are available in the main towns, but may have limited hours and selection\n- Some prescription medication may not be available on the island, and may need to be ordered from elsewhere\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medication with you when traveling to Montserrat\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or visit the emergency room at the Montserrat Hospital.
