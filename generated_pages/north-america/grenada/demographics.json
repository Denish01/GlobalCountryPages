The population growth rate is relatively slow, at about 0.5% per year, which is due to a combination of low fertility rates and emigration. The urban population accounts for about 39% of the total population, with the majority of people living in rural areas. The population density is approximately 318 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high compared to other Caribbean islands. Grenada's population is expected to continue growing slowly, with a projected increase of about 10% by 2030.\n\nThe population of Grenada is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the country and to other countries. Many Grenadians have emigrated to other countries, such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, in search of better economic opportunities. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with many Grenadians maintaining strong ties to their homeland. Within the country, there is also a significant amount of migration from rural areas to urban areas, particularly to the capital city of St. George's, in search of better job opportunities and access to services.\n\nThe population of Grenada is also affected by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which can have a significant impact on the country's population and economy. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused significant damage and displacement, with many people forced to seek shelter in other countries. The country has since made significant progress in rebuilding and recovering from the disaster, but the risk of natural disasters remains a significant challenge for the population.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| African | 82% | Nationwide | Descendants of enslaved Africans |\n| Mixed | 13% | Nationwide | Mixed African, European, and indigenous ancestry |\n| European | 2% | Mainly in urban areas | Mainly of British, French, and German descent |\n| Indigenous | 1% | Rural areas | Kalinago people, the indigenous people of Grenada |\n| Asian | 1% | Mainly in urban areas | Mainly of Indian and Chinese descent |\n| Other | 1% | Nationwide | Includes people of other ethnicities, such as Lebanese and Syrian |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Grenada are diverse and reflect the country's complex history and cultural heritage.
