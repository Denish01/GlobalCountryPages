The property market in Grenada is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional homes, apartments, and villas, with a growing demand for luxury properties and vacation rentals. The current market conditions are relatively stable, with a steady increase in property prices over the past few years, driven by a growing tourism industry and a limited supply of new developments.

Urban areas, such as St. George's and Grand Anse, tend to be more expensive than rural areas, where land and property prices are generally lower.
