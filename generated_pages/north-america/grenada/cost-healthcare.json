  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Grenada varies depending on the type of service and provider, with public healthcare services generally being more affordable than private ones, and a health expenditure per capita of $526.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $526 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 48.5% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XCD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGrenada's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the public system can be overwhelmed at times, and wait times for non-emergency procedures can be long. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the first point of contact for medical care, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. Private healthcare providers in Grenada offer high-quality medical care, often with shorter wait times and more personalized attention. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Grenada is generally well-organized, with a network of public hospitals, health centers, and private clinics. The main public hospital is the General Hospital in St. George's, which provides a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, surgery, and maternity care. Private hospitals and clinics, such as the St. Augustine's Medical Services and the Grenada Hospital, also offer a range of medical services, often with more modern equipment and facilities. While the public healthcare system is generally affordable, private healthcare can be quite expensive, and health insurance is often necessary to cover the costs.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may have more modern equipment |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dentists may offer more cosmetic services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$30 | $30-$50 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may have more modern facilities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$2,000 | Private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Private hospitals may offer more personalized care |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public hospital care, doctor visits, and basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private hospital care, specialist consultations, and advanced procedures |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Global coverage, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies, with prices varying depending on the type and brand of medication.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices generally lower than in the US.\n- Some common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, may be available without a prescription at pharmacies.\n- Pharmacy hours are generally from 8am to 6pm, Monday to Friday, and 8am to 1pm on Saturdays.\n- Some pharmacies may offer delivery services or online ordering with delivery.\n- Prices for medications can vary depending on the pharmacy and location, so it's a good idea to compare prices before making a purchase.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's best to call 911 or go to the nearest hospital. The General Hospital in St. George's is the main public hospital and provides 24-hour emergency care. Private hospitals, such as the St. Augustine's Medical Services, also offer emergency care, often with more modern equipment and facilities. Ambulance services are available, but may not always be reliable, so it's a good idea to have a Plan B, such as a taxi or private transportation. For foreigners, it's recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations, as the quality of medical care in Grenada may not be up to the standards of developed countries.\n\nFor emergency care, the best hospitals for foreigners are generally the private hospitals, such as the St. Augustine's Medical Services and the Grenada Hospital, which offer high-quality medical care and modern facilities. These hospitals often have English-speaking staff and may have more experience in treating foreign patients. However, even at private hospitals, the quality of care may not always be up to the standards of developed countries, so it's still important to have health insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations. In the event of a serious medical emergency, it may be necessary to evacuate to a nearby country, such as Trinidad and Tobago or the US, for further treatment. [CALLOUT] It's always a good idea to research the local healthcare system and have a plan in place before traveling to Grenada. [/CALLOUT]",
