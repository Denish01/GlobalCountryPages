# The Truth About Grenada - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Grenada, a sovereign island nation, is located in the southernmost part of the Caribbean Sea, northeast of Venezuela. The island was first inhabited by the indigenous **Kaliningo** people, who migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1498. The Kaliningo people called the island **Camahogne**. In 1498, Columbus named the island **Concepción**, and it was later renamed Grenada by Spanish explorers. The French established the first European settlement in 1649, and the island became a French colony. In 1762, Grenada was ceded to the British, and it remained a British colony until it gained independence on February 7, 1974.

The road to independence was long and complex. Grenada was a member of the **West Indies Federation**, a short-lived attempt at a Caribbean confederation, from 1958 to 1962. After the federation dissolved, Grenada began to move towards independence. The island's first prime minister, **Eric Gairy**, played a key role in the independence movement. On February 7, 1974, Grenada became an independent nation, with Gairy as its first prime minister.

Grenada's early years of independence were marked by political instability and economic challenges. In 1979, a Marxist revolution led by **Maurice Bishop** overthrew the Gairy government, and a new government was established. However, this government was short-lived, and in 1983, a U.S.-led military invasion, known as **Operation Urgent Fury**, toppled the government and restored democratic rule.

Today, Grenada is a **parliamentary democracy** and a member of the **Commonwealth of Nations**. The island nation has a diverse economy, with a mix of agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The country continues to develop its infrastructure and economy, while maintaining its rich cultural heritage and natural beauty.
