[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Grenada is a tropical island located in the Caribbean, with a climate that is characterized by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from January to April, is the best time to visit Grenada, with dry and sunny weather, low humidity, and average temperatures ranging from 75°F to 85°F (24°C to 30°C). The wet season, which runs from May to November, is characterized by high humidity, frequent rain showers, and a higher risk of hurricanes and tropical storms. The wet season is also the low season for tourism, with lower prices and fewer crowds.

The dry season is the peak season for tourism in Grenada, with the highest number of visitors arriving between December and April. During this time, the island is bustling with activity, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are at their highest. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer visitors and lower prices. However, the risk of hurricanes and tropical storms is higher during this time, and some tourist facilities may be closed.

The seasons in Grenada also affect the types of activities and events that take place on the island. During the dry season, outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and water sports are popular, while the wet season is better suited for indoor activities such as visiting museums, galleries, and historic sites. The island also hosts several festivals and events throughout the year, including the Grenada Carnival, which takes place in August, and the Grenada Music Festival, which takes place in June.
