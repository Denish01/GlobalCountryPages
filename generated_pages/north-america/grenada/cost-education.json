The country has a well-developed public education system, with 12 years of compulsory education, starting from primary school at the age of 5 and ending with secondary school at the age of 17. While public education is generally free or subsidized, the quality can vary depending on the school and location. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher level of education quality, but at a higher cost. International schools are also available, catering to expatriate families and offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).\n\nThe education system in Grenada is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, administering exams, and providing resources to schools. The country has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with a literacy rate of 96% and a high enrollment rate in primary and secondary schools. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the quality of education in some public schools and the limited availability of specialized programs, such as vocational training or special needs education.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on school and location |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Range depends on school reputation and location |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on school and location |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Range depends on school reputation and location |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | Offers IB or CIE curriculum, catering to expatriate families |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $2,000-$4,000 | $4,000-$6,000 | St. George's University is a popular public university |\n| Private University | $4,000-$6,000 | $6,000-$8,000 | Offers specialized programs, such as business or healthcare |\n| Top-Ranked University | $6,000-$8,000 | $8,000-$10,000 | St. George's University is a top-ranked university in the region |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Depends on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Depends on tutor's qualifications and subject |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Offers English language courses for international students |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Depends on school requirements and quality of supplies |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Depends on school requirements and quality of uniform |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expatriate families are international schools, which offer a high-quality education and a curriculum that is recognized globally.\n- Scholarships are available for local and international students, but are often competitive and limited in number.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular, with many universities and colleges offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The education quality in Grenada is generally good, but can vary depending on the school and location, with some public schools facing challenges in terms of resources and infrastructure.\n- Expatriate families should research schools thoroughly and consider factors such as curriculum, extracurricular activities, and school community when choosing a school for their children.\n- Grenada is a popular destination for medical students, with St. George's University being a top-ranked medical school in the region.",
