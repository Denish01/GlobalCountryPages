[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Grenada's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and telecommunications services. However, the costs of these services can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the peak tourist season (December to April) leading to increased prices. The electricity cost, in particular, can vary depending on the usage, with a higher cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for larger apartments or households with high energy consumption.

The overall cost of living in Grenada is relatively high compared to other Caribbean islands, and the utility costs are no exception. However, the government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of electricity and promote the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities remains a significant expense for households and businesses in Grenada, with the average monthly utility bill accounting for a substantial portion of the overall expenses.

- To set up utilities, it's recommended to contact the providers (such as Grenada Electricity Services Ltd. or National Water and Sewerage Authority) at least a week in advance to schedule the connection.
- Prepaid electricity plans can be a cost-effective option for small households or apartments, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience.
- Flow and Digicel are the main internet and phone service providers in Grenada, offering a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.
- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or walking/cycling instead of driving.
- It's also a good idea to monitor your usage and adjust your habits accordingly to avoid unexpected high bills.
