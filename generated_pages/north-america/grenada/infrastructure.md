[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Grenada's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other Caribbean islands, with a strong focus on tourism and a growing economy. Recent investments have been made in upgrading the island's roads, airports, and ports, with a focus on improving access to rural areas. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure access, with many rural areas lacking reliable access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these gaps, including the development of new infrastructure projects and the upgrading of existing facilities.

The island's infrastructure has also been impacted by natural disasters, including hurricanes and storms, which have caused significant damage to roads, buildings, and other critical infrastructure. As a result, the government has had to invest in reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts, which have placed a strain on the island's resources. Despite these challenges, Grenada's infrastructure continues to improve, with a focus on sustainability and resilience.

Grenada's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location in the Caribbean, with the island serving as a key hub for regional trade and commerce. The government has invested in upgrading the island's ports and airports, with a focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs. This has helped to attract new businesses and investments to the island, including in the tourism and manufacturing sectors.
