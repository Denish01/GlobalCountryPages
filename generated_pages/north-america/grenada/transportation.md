[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Grenada's main international airport is the Maurice Bishop International Airport, located in the southern part of the island, about 8 kilometers from the capital city of St. George's. The airport receives direct flights from major hubs such as Miami, New York, and London, as well as connections from other Caribbean islands. If you're coming from neighboring islands, you can also take a ferry or a charter flight. The main overland entry point is the port in St. George's, where you can arrive by ferry or cruise ship.

To get to Grenada, you can fly into the Maurice Bishop International Airport or take a ferry from neighboring islands such as Trinidad and Tobago or Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The airport is served by several major airlines, including American Airlines, British Airways, and Caribbean Airlines, among others. Once you arrive, you can take a taxi or bus to your destination, or rent a car to explore the island on your own.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Grenada has a limited domestic air network, with no scheduled flights between the main island and the smaller islands that make up the Grenadines. However, you can take a charter flight or a ferry to get to the smaller islands, such as Carriacou and Petite Martinique. If you do need to take a domestic flight, you can book with a local airline such as SVG Air or Grenadines Air Alliance. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $100 to $200, depending on the route and the airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Grenada has no rail network, so you won't be able to take a train to get around the island. The island's terrain and size make it more suitable for road transportation, and the government has invested in improving the road network in recent years.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Grenada has a public bus system that operates throughout the island, with routes connecting the capital city of St. George's to other major towns and villages. The buses are relatively affordable, with fares starting from around $1 to $2 for a one-way trip. You can also take a minibus or a coach to get around, which can be a more comfortable option for longer trips. The main bus company is the Public Transport Service Corporation, which operates a fleet of buses and minibuses.
