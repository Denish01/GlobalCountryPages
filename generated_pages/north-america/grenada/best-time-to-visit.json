[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nGrenada is a tropical island located in the Caribbean, with a climate that is characterized by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from January to April, is the best time to visit Grenada, with dry and sunny weather, low humidity, and average temperatures ranging from 75°F to 85°F (24°C to 30°C). The wet season, which runs from May to November, is characterized by high humidity, frequent rain showers, and a higher risk of hurricanes and tropical storms. The wet season is also the low season for tourism, with lower prices and fewer crowds.\n\nThe dry season is the peak season for tourism in Grenada, with the highest number of visitors arriving between December and April. During this time, the island is bustling with activity, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are at their highest. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer visitors and lower prices. However, the risk of hurricanes and tropical storms is higher during this time, and some tourist facilities may be closed.\n\nThe seasons in Grenada also affect the types of activities and events that take place on the island. During the dry season, outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and water sports are popular, while the wet season is better suited for indoor activities such as visiting museums, galleries, and historic sites. The island also hosts several festivals and events throughout the year, including the Grenada Carnival, which takes place in August, and the Grenada Music Festival, which takes place in June.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Dry and sunny | Low | $ | Beach activities, water sports |\n| February | Dry and sunny | Low | $ | Romantic getaways, couples' activities |\n| March | Dry and sunny | Medium | $$ | Outdoor activities, hiking, biking |\n| April | Dry and sunny | Medium | $$ | Festivals, events, cultural activities |\n| May | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Budget travelers, solo travelers |\n| June | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Music festivals, cultural events |\n| July | Hot and humid | Medium | $$ | Summer vacations, family activities |\n| August | Hot and humid | High | $$$ | Carnival, festivals, parties |\n| September | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Budget travelers, solo travelers |\n| October | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Outdoor activities, nature reserves |\n| November | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Cultural events, historic sites |\n| December | Dry and sunny | High | $$$ | Holiday season, family activities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Grenada Carnival | August | A vibrant festival with music, dance, and costume competitions |\n| Grenada Music Festival | June | A festival featuring local and international music performances |\n| Grenada Spice Festival | May | A celebration of Grenada's spice industry, with food, drink, and music |\n| Grenada Jazz Festival | April | A festival featuring jazz music performances by local and international artists |\n| Grenada Independence Day | February | A celebration of Grenada's independence, with parades, music, and cultural events |\n| Grenada Christmas Festival | December | A festive celebration with music, food, and drink, and a Christmas market |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The northern part of the island, including the capital city St. George's, tends to be drier and sunnier than the southern part, which is more prone to rain showers.\n- The eastern coast of the island, which is exposed to the Atlantic Ocean, is more prone to strong winds and rough seas than the western coast, which is more sheltered.\n- The island's interior, which is home to several nature reserves and hiking trails, is cooler and more humid than the coastal areas.\n- The southern part of the island, which is home to several beaches and bays, is more popular with tourists and has a more developed tourist infrastructure.\n- The northern part of the island, which is more rural and less developed, is better suited for those looking for a more peaceful and secluded vacation experience.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tourist services well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, which runs from April to May or from September to November, for lower prices and fewer crowds.\n- Pack light and breathable clothing, as well as sun protection and insect repellent, to protect yourself from the sun and bugs.\n- Be aware of the risk of hurricanes and tropical storms, and check the weather forecast before traveling to Grenada.\n- Consider purchasing travel insurance to protect yourself against unexpected events, such as natural disasters or trip cancellations.\n- Research and respect local customs and traditions, especially during festivals and events, to avoid unintentionally offending locals.",
