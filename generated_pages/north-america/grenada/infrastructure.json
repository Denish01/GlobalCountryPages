  "content": "Grenada's infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on tourism and a growing economy, but still faces challenges in terms of rural access and reliability.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 95% of population\nInternet Penetration: 55%\nRoad Network: 1,127 km, with good quality roads connecting major towns\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nGrenada's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other Caribbean islands, with a strong focus on tourism and a growing economy. Recent investments have been made in upgrading the island's roads, airports, and ports, with a focus on improving access to rural areas. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure access, with many rural areas lacking reliable access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these gaps, including the development of new infrastructure projects and the upgrading of existing facilities.\n\nThe island's infrastructure has also been impacted by natural disasters, including hurricanes and storms, which have caused significant damage to roads, buildings, and other critical infrastructure. As a result, the government has had to invest in reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts, which have placed a strain on the island's resources. Despite these challenges, Grenada's infrastructure continues to improve, with a focus on sustainability and resilience.\n\nGrenada's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location in the Caribbean, with the island serving as a key hub for regional trade and commerce. The government has invested in upgrading the island's ports and airports, with a focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs. This has helped to attract new businesses and investments to the island, including in the tourism and manufacturing sectors.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 1,127 km | Good | Connects major towns and cities, with some rural areas still lacking access |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network on the island |\n| Airports | 2 international, 1 domestic | Good | Maurice Bishop International Airport is the main airport, with a smaller airport on the island of Carriacou |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | The Port of St. George's is the main port, with a smaller port on the island of Carriacou |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Grenada's power generation is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a focus on diesel and heavy fuel oil.\n- The island has a total installed capacity of 55 MW, with a peak demand of around 30 MW.\n- The electricity grid is relatively reliable, with an average of 2-3 hours of **power outages** per month.\n- The government has set a target of generating 20% of the island's electricity from **renewable energy sources** by 2025, with a focus on solar and wind power.\n- The island's energy sector is regulated by the **Grenada Electricity Commission**, which is responsible for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the grid.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink, with a high level of access to piped water in urban areas.\n- Sanitation coverage is around 90%, with a focus on improving access to rural areas.\n- Water access in rural areas is still a challenge, with many communities relying on **rainwater harvesting** and **wells**.\n- The government has implemented various initiatives to improve water and sanitation services, including the development of new **water treatment plants** and **sewerage systems**.\n- The island's water sector is regulated by the **National Water and Sewerage Authority**, which is responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of water and sanitation services.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively high, with around 90% of the island having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in some areas, with a focus on improving access to rural communities.\n- The island has a relatively high level of **internet penetration**, with around 55% of the population having access to the internet.\n- The government has implemented various initiatives to improve telecommunications services, including the development of new **cell towers** and **fiber-optic cables**.\n- The island's telecommunications sector is regulated by the **Grenada Telecommunications Authority**, which is responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of telecommunications services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major **infrastructure development program**, with a focus on upgrading the island's roads, airports, and ports.\n- The program includes the development of a new **international airport**, with a focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs.\n- The government has also launched a **renewable energy program**, with a focus on generating 20% of the island's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025.\n- The island is also investing in **water and sanitation infrastructure**, with a focus on improving access to rural areas and reducing the risk of water-borne diseases.\n- The government has secured funding from various international organizations, including the **World Bank** and the **Inter-American Development Bank**, to support these development projects.",
