The airport receives direct flights from major hubs such as Miami, New York, and London, as well as connections from other Caribbean islands. If you're coming from neighboring islands, you can also take a ferry or a charter flight.

Once you arrive, you can take a taxi or bus to your destination, or rent a car to explore the island on your own.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nGrenada has a limited domestic air network, with no scheduled flights between the main island and the smaller islands that make up the Grenadines.

If you do need to take a domestic flight, you can book with a local airline such as SVG Air or Grenadines Air Alliance. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $100 to $200, depending on the route and the airline.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nGrenada has no rail network, so you won't be able to take a train to get around the island.
