The main transportation modes in Grenada include buses, taxis, and rental cars. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and cities. Most people in Grenada get around using buses or taxis, which are readily available and affordable. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system can make it challenging to travel to remote areas of the island.\n\nThe road network in Grenada is generally in good condition, with major roads connecting the capital city, St. George's, to other parts of the island. However, some rural areas may have poorer road conditions, which can make travel more difficult. Despite these challenges, Grenada's transportation system is relatively well-organized, with many transportation options available to visitors and locals alike. Additionally, the island's small size means that many attractions and amenities are within walking distance, making it easy to get around without relying on public transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1.50 | $45 | Good coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2.50 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly for short distances |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2.50 | $10-$15 | Available at airports and major towns |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3 | $1.50 | $8-$12 | Grenada Taxi and Island Ride available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $25-$40 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-$100 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in city center |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mainly for short distances |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or using ride-hailing apps.\n- Be sure to negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, as prices can vary depending on the driver and traffic conditions.\n- Use reputable taxi services or ride-hailing apps to ensure your safety, especially at night.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or to explore the island's more remote areas.\n- Be aware of limited parking options in the city center and plan accordingly.\n- Use **Grenada Taxi** and **Island Ride** apps to book rides in advance and avoid higher prices during peak hours.",
