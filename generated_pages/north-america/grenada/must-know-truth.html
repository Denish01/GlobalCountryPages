        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Grenada, a sovereign island nation, is located in the southernmost part of the Caribbean Sea, northeast of Venezuela. The island was first inhabited by the indigenous <strong>Kaliningo</strong> people, who migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1498. The Kaliningo people called the island <strong>Camahogne</strong>. In 1498, Columbus named the island <strong>Concepción</strong>, and it was later renamed Grenada by Spanish explorers. The French established the first European settlement in 1649, and the island became a French colony. In 1762, Grenada was ceded to the British, and it remained a British colony until it gained independence on February 7, 1974.</p>
        <p>The road to independence was long and complex. Grenada was a member of the <strong>West Indies Federation</strong>, a short-lived attempt at a Caribbean confederation, from 1958 to 1962. After the federation dissolved, Grenada began to move towards independence. The island's first prime minister, <strong>Eric Gairy</strong>, played a key role in the independence movement. On February 7, 1974, Grenada became an independent nation, with Gairy as its first prime minister.</p>
        <p>Grenada's early years of independence were marked by political instability and economic challenges. In 1979, a Marxist revolution led by <strong>Maurice Bishop</strong> overthrew the Gairy government, and a new government was established. However, this government was short-lived, and in 1983, a U.S.-led military invasion, known as <strong>Operation Urgent Fury</strong>, toppled the government and restored democratic rule.</p>
        <p>Today, Grenada is a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> and a member of the <strong>Commonwealth of Nations</strong>. The island nation has a diverse economy, with a mix of agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The country continues to develop its infrastructure and economy, while maintaining its rich cultural heritage and natural beauty.</p>
