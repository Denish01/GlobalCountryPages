The cost of food is driven up by factors such as transportation costs, taxes, and the limited availability of certain ingredients. However, the country's **agricultural sector** is also a significant contributor to the economy, with many local farms producing a variety of fruits, vegetables, and other crops. Eating out is a popular activity in Grenada, with many restaurants serving a mix of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also common, with many residents preparing meals using fresh ingredients from the market or their own gardens.\n\nThe **eating-out culture** in Grenada is vibrant, with many restaurants and cafes serving a range of dishes, from traditional Grenadian cuisine to international flavors. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location and type of establishment. In general, eating out can range from $15 USD for a meal at an inexpensive restaurant to $40 USD for a meal for two at a mid-range restaurant. In contrast, preparing meals at home can be more cost-effective, with a monthly grocery budget for one person ranging from $300 to $500 USD.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 6.75 XCD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.00 | 5.40 XCD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.50 | 4.05 XCD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 3.25 XCD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 16.20 XCD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $8.00 | 21.60 XCD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $4.00 | 10.80 XCD | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 6.75 XCD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 4.05 XCD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.20 | 3.25 XCD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 21.60 XCD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.50 | 4.05 XCD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (typical dishes like **oil down** or **pepper pot soup**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-$50 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $60-$100 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, there are two main options in Grenada: supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, but they offer a wider range of products, including imported goods. Local markets, on the other hand, are a great place to find fresh produce, meat, and other staples at lower prices. In general, prices at local markets are around 10-20% lower than at supermarkets. However, the selection may be more limited, and the quality of the products can vary.\n\nFor visitors and residents alike, it's a good idea to shop at both supermarkets and local markets to get the best value for your money. For example, you can buy fresh produce like fruits and vegetables at the local market, but head to the supermarket for staples like rice, pasta, and canned goods. [CALLOUT] Be sure to check the prices and quality of the products before making a purchase, and don't be afraid to **haggle** at the local market. Bargaining is a common practice in Grenada, and vendors often expect it.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eat at local eateries or **street food stalls** to try traditional dishes like **oil down** or **pepper pot soup** at a lower cost.\n- Buy fresh produce like fruits and vegetables at the local market to get the best value for your money.\n- Try **local staples** like **callaloo**, **christophene**, or **yams**, which are often cheaper and more flavorful than imported alternatives.\n- Avoid buying imported goods like **apples** or **beef**, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- Consider buying in bulk and **cooking at home** to save money and enjoy a more authentic Grenadian culinary experience.\n- Don't be afraid to try new foods and **experiment with local ingredients** to create your own unique dishes.",
