While the urban areas, such as the capital St. George's, tend to have better internet connectivity, the rural areas are not far behind, with most mobile carriers offering decent coverage. However, there is still a noticeable divide between urban and rural areas, with the latter sometimes experiencing slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in Grenada is generally good, with most providers offering stable connections, although occasional outages can occur, especially during severe weather conditions.\n\nThe government of Grenada has been actively working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to remote and underserved areas. This has led to a significant expansion of mobile network coverage, with most carriers now offering 4G services across the island. Additionally, many businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and cafes, offer free WiFi to their customers, making it easy for tourists and remote workers to stay connected. Overall, the internet in Grenada is relatively well-developed, making it an attractive destination for those who need to stay connected while traveling or working remotely.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Grenada is relatively straightforward, with several mobile carriers offering tourist-friendly plans.
