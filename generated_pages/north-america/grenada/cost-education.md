[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Grenada's education system is based on the British model, with English being the primary language of instruction. The country has a well-developed public education system, with 12 years of compulsory education, starting from primary school at the age of 5 and ending with secondary school at the age of 17. While public education is generally free or subsidized, the quality can vary depending on the school and location. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher level of education quality, but at a higher cost. International schools are also available, catering to expatriate families and offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).

The education system in Grenada is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, administering exams, and providing resources to schools. The country has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with a literacy rate of 96% and a high enrollment rate in primary and secondary schools. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the quality of education in some public schools and the limited availability of specialized programs, such as vocational training or special needs education.
