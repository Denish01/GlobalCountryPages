[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Grenada is a small island nation with a relatively well-developed transportation system, making it easy to get around the island. The main transportation modes in Grenada include buses, taxis, and rental cars. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and cities. Most people in Grenada get around using buses or taxis, which are readily available and affordable. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system can make it challenging to travel to remote areas of the island.

The road network in Grenada is generally in good condition, with major roads connecting the capital city, St. George's, to other parts of the island. However, some rural areas may have poorer road conditions, which can make travel more difficult. Despite these challenges, Grenada's transportation system is relatively well-organized, with many transportation options available to visitors and locals alike. Additionally, the island's small size means that many attractions and amenities are within walking distance, making it easy to get around without relying on public transportation.
