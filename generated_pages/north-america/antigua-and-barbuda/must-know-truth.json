The country has a rich and diverse history, with the first inhabitants being the **Siboney** people, who migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1493, Christopher Columbus sighted the islands during his second voyage to the New World. The Spanish were the first Europeans to colonize the islands, but they were eventually replaced by the British, who established a colony in 1632.\n\nThe British colonization of Antigua and Barbuda lasted for over three centuries, during which time the islands developed a thriving sugar industry based on **plantation slavery**.
