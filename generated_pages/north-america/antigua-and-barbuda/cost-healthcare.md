[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available to locals and foreigners. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, with longer wait times and limited resources. Locals often rely on the public system for basic care, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private facilities, which offer more comprehensive and specialized care. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients typically required to pay out-of-pocket for services, although some private insurance plans may be accepted. It is highly recommended that foreigners and expats obtain health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially in private facilities.

The quality of care in private facilities is generally higher, with more modern equipment and better-trained staff. Many private facilities in Antigua and Barbuda are accredited by international organizations, such as the Joint Commission International, and offer a range of specialized services, including cardiology, oncology, and orthopedic surgery. However, these services come at a higher cost, and patients may need to pay upfront for services, even if they have insurance. In contrast, public facilities often struggle with limited resources, including outdated equipment and a shortage of specialized staff. Despite these challenges, the public system provides essential care to locals, including emergency services, maternity care, and basic medical treatment.
