[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Antigua and Barbuda, located in the northeastern Caribbean, has a tropical climate with two distinct seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity, plenty of sunshine, and gentle trade winds, making it the ideal time to visit the islands. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by higher humidity, occasional rain showers, and a greater risk of hurricanes. The climate is relatively consistent throughout the islands, with the coastal areas tend to be cooler than the interior.

The dry season is the peak tourist season, with the majority of visitors arriving between December and April. This period offers the best weather conditions, with average temperatures ranging from 77°F to 82°F (25°C to 28°C), making it perfect for outdoor activities such as swimming, snorkeling, and hiking. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices for accommodations and tourist services. However, the risk of hurricanes and tropical storms is higher during this period, and some tourist facilities may be closed or operate on reduced hours.

The seasons can significantly affect travel plans, with the dry season being the best time for water sports and outdoor activities, while the wet season is better suited for indoor activities, such as visiting museums, shopping, and dining. Additionally, the peak season is the best time to experience the islands' vibrant culture and festivals, while the low season is ideal for those seeking a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere.
