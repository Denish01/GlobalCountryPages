The GDP per capita (PPP) of $33,386 suggests a high level of economic development, which is reflected in the prices of goods and services. However, the cost of living can vary greatly depending on your lifestyle and budget preferences. A budget of $2,500 per month can provide a modest lifestyle, while $4,000 per month can offer a mid-range lifestyle with some comforts, and $6,000 per month can provide a comfortable lifestyle with many amenities.\n\nThe cost of living in Antigua and Barbuda is comparable to other Caribbean island nations, such as the Bahamas and Barbados. However, it is more expensive than some of its neighboring countries, such as Saint Kitts and Nevis.
