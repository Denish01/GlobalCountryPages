However, there is a notable urban-rural divide, with faster internet speeds and better mobile network coverage available in urban areas such as St. John's, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall internet infrastructure is well-developed, and most users can expect a stable and reliable connection.\n\nThe government of Antigua and Barbuda has made efforts to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the implementation of a national broadband network and the introduction of new mobile network technologies. As a result, the internet has become an essential tool for businesses, education, and everyday life in Antigua and Barbuda. However, the lack of 5G network coverage may be a limitation for some users, particularly those who require high-speed internet for applications such as online gaming or video streaming.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Antigua and Barbuda, tourists and visitors can purchase one from a local mobile carrier such as Flow, Digicel, or APua.

The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 20 USD, and data plans are available starting from 10 USD per week for 1 GB of data. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as some smaller operators may have limited coverage and slower speeds.\n\nThe process of purchasing a SIM card is relatively straightforward, and most carriers offer a range of data plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets. Some carriers also offer prepaid plans, which can be a convenient option for short-term visitors.
