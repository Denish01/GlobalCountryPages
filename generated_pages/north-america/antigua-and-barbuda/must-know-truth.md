# The Truth About Antigua and Barbuda - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Antigua and Barbuda is a sovereign country located in the Caribbean, comprising two major islands and several smaller ones. The country has a rich and diverse history, with the first inhabitants being the **Siboney** people, who migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. In 1493, Christopher Columbus sighted the islands during his second voyage to the New World. The Spanish were the first Europeans to colonize the islands, but they were eventually replaced by the British, who established a colony in 1632.

The British colonization of Antigua and Barbuda lasted for over three centuries, during which time the islands developed a thriving sugar industry based on **plantation slavery**. The transatlantic slave trade brought thousands of enslaved Africans to the islands, who were forced to work on sugar plantations. The British abolished slavery in 1834, but the legacy of this period continues to shape the country's culture and identity. Antigua and Barbuda gained **internal self-government** in 1967 and achieved full independence from the United Kingdom on November 1, 1981.

The country has also been affected by natural disasters, including hurricanes and droughts, which have had significant impacts on the economy and infrastructure. Today, Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the **Commonwealth of Nations** and the **Organization of Eastern Caribbean States**.
