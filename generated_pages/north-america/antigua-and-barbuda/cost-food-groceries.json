This, combined with the country's high inflation rate of 6.2%, means that prices can fluctuate rapidly. Despite this, eating out is a popular pastime in Antigua and Barbuda, with many restaurants serving a mix of local and international cuisine. However, for those on a budget, home cooking is often the more affordable option, with a monthly grocery budget of $300-$500 USD able to provide for basic staples and some fresh produce.\n\nThe eating-out culture in Antigua and Barbuda is vibrant, with many restaurants and bars serving a range of dishes from seafood to BBQ. However, for those looking to save money, cooking at home is often the better option. Local staples such as **rice**, **beans**, and **chicken** are relatively affordable, and can be used to make a variety of dishes. Fresh produce, such as **fruits** and **vegetables**, can be more expensive, but are often available at local markets and from street vendors.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $3-$5 | 8-14 XCD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2-$3 | 5-8 XCD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-$3 | 5-8 XCD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 3-5 XCD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6-$8 | 16-22 XCD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10-$12 | 27-32 XCD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-$7 | 14-19 XCD | imported |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 5-8 XCD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2-$3 | 5-8 XCD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 3-5 XCD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8-$10 | 22-27 XCD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-$3 | 5-8 XCD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | (typical dishes: fried fish, BBQ chicken) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | (one person, 1-2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$100 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $4-$6 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $6-$8 | |\n| Cappuccino | $4-$6 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, there are two main options in Antigua and Barbuda: supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, but offer a wider range of products, including imported goods. Local markets, on the other hand, are often cheaper, but may have more limited selection. For staples like **fruits** and **vegetables**, local markets are often the best option, with prices significantly lower than in supermarkets. However, for imported goods or specialty items, supermarkets may be the only option.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with some items costing up to 50% more in supermarkets. However, supermarkets often offer more convenience, with longer opening hours and a wider range of products. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more traditional shopping experience, with vendors often willing to negotiate prices. Bargaining is not always expected, but it is common, especially for larger purchases. When shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to have some local currency (XCD) on hand, as not all vendors accept credit or debit cards.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries or food stalls can be a cheaper option, with meals starting from around $10-$15 USD.\n- **Rice** and **beans** are staple ingredients in Antiguan cuisine, and are often relatively affordable.\n- **Fresh fish** is widely available, and can be a good option for those looking for a cheap and healthy meal.\n- **Fruits** and **vegetables** are often cheaper at local markets than in supermarkets.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, which can be expensive due to high import taxes.\n- Consider buying in bulk and cooking at home to save money, as eating out can be expensive.",
