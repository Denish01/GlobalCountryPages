[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Antigua and Barbuda is generally well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and telecommunications services. However, the costs of these services can fluctuate due to factors such as fuel prices, seasonal demand, and government regulations. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the peak summer months when air conditioning usage is at its highest. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels and promote renewable energy sources, which may impact utility costs in the long term.

The overall cost of living in Antigua and Barbuda is relatively high, and utility costs can account for a significant portion of a household's expenses. However, the country's GDP per capita PPP of $33,386 (2024) and relatively low inflation rate of 6.2% (2024) suggest that the economy is stable, and utility costs are likely to remain manageable for most consumers. It's worth noting that the country's education spend of 3.1% of GDP (2023) and health expenditure per capita of $841 (2023) may also impact the overall cost of living and utility costs.
