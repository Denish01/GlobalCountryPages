  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Antigua and Barbuda can vary depending on factors such as location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($75 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($30 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.35 per kWh)\nCurrency: XCD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Antigua and Barbuda is generally well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and telecommunications services. However, the costs of these services can fluctuate due to factors such as fuel prices, seasonal demand, and government regulations. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the peak summer months when air conditioning usage is at its highest. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels and promote renewable energy sources, which may impact utility costs in the long term.\n\nThe overall cost of living in Antigua and Barbuda is relatively high, and utility costs can account for a significant portion of a household's expenses. However, the country's GDP per capita PPP of $33,386 (2024) and relatively low inflation rate of 6.2% (2024) suggest that the economy is stable, and utility costs are likely to remain manageable for most consumers. It's worth noting that the country's education spend of 3.1% of GDP (2023) and health expenditure per capita of $841 (2023) may also impact the overall cost of living and utility costs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $150 | $250 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $0 | $0 | $0 | not commonly used |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in municipal taxes |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$195** | **$310** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-75 | 10-20 Mbps | Flow, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 50-100 Mbps | Flow, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Digicel, Flow |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Digicel, Flow |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $75-150 | varies | Flow, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | ABS TV, Antigua and Barbuda's national broadcaster |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's recommended to contact the providers directly, such as the Antigua Public Utilities Authority (APUA) for electricity and water, and Digicel or Flow for internet and phone services.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience.\n- The best internet providers in Antigua and Barbuda are Flow and Digicel, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, consumers can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or carpooling to reduce fuel consumption.\n- It's also a good idea to monitor usage and adjust plans accordingly to avoid excess charges and minimize waste.",
