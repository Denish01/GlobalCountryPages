  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Antigua and Barbuda varies between public and private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $841 and out-of-pocket spend of 20.8% of total health expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $841\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 20.8%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911 or 462-0251\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: XCD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nAntigua and Barbuda has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available to locals and foreigners. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, with longer wait times and limited resources. Locals often rely on the public system for basic care, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private facilities, which offer more comprehensive and specialized care. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients typically required to pay out-of-pocket for services, although some private insurance plans may be accepted. It is highly recommended that foreigners and expats obtain health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially in private facilities.\n\nThe quality of care in private facilities is generally higher, with more modern equipment and better-trained staff. Many private facilities in Antigua and Barbuda are accredited by international organizations, such as the Joint Commission International, and offer a range of specialized services, including cardiology, oncology, and orthopedic surgery. However, these services come at a higher cost, and patients may need to pay upfront for services, even if they have insurance. In contrast, public facilities often struggle with limited resources, including outdated equipment and a shortage of specialized staff. Despite these challenges, the public system provides essential care to locals, including emergency services, maternity care, and basic medical treatment.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$250 | Private facilities may require upfront payment |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Public dental clinics may have limited services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Private facilities may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Private facilities may require upfront payment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | Public hospitals may have limited services |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Private facilities may offer faster results |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public facilities, basic medical services, and emergency care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private facilities, specialized services, and international coverage |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at public and private pharmacies, with prices varying depending on the medication and location.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 for basic medications such as pain relievers and antihistamines.\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with many medications requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Pharmacy availability is good, with many pharmacies located in urban areas, including St. John's and surrounding towns.\n- Some medications may be imported from the US or other countries, which can increase costs.\n- Prices for common medications such as antibiotics and blood pressure medications range from $10 to $50.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, patients should call 911 or 462-0251 for assistance. Ambulance services are available, although response times may vary depending on location. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally private facilities, such as the **Adelin Medical Centre** or the **Medicine Shoppe**, which offer more comprehensive and specialized care. These facilities often have English-speaking staff and may accept international insurance plans. However, patients should be prepared to pay upfront for services, even if they have insurance. In the event of a serious medical emergency, patients may need to be evacuated to a larger medical facility, such as in the US or UK, which can be costly and may require specialized insurance coverage. It is essential for foreigners and expats to have a plan in place for emergency care, including insurance coverage and a means of payment.",
