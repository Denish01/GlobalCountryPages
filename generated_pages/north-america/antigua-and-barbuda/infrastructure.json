  "content": "The infrastructure in Antigua and Barbuda is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on tourism and a growing economy, although there are still some challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 76%\nRoad Network: 834 km, moderate quality with some paved and unpaved sections\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nAntigua and Barbuda has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving its transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications. The country's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other Caribbean nations, with a strong emphasis on supporting the tourism industry. However, there is still a notable urban-rural gap, with St. John's and other urban areas generally having better access to infrastructure services than rural communities. Recent investments have aimed to address this disparity, with projects such as rural road upgrades and expanded access to clean water and sanitation.\n\nThe country's infrastructure has also been impacted by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to roads, buildings, and other critical infrastructure. As a result, there is a growing focus on building resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, including the use of **climate-resilient** materials and designs. Despite these challenges, Antigua and Barbuda's infrastructure continues to support the country's growing economy and tourism industry, with a strong focus on providing high-quality services to visitors and residents alike.\n\nOverall, Antigua and Barbuda's infrastructure is well-developed, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in rural areas. The government has committed to ongoing investments in infrastructure development, with a focus on supporting sustainable economic growth and improving the quality of life for all citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 834 km | Moderate | Some paved and unpaved sections, with ongoing upgrades |\n| Railways | 0 km | N/A | No rail network |\n| Airports | 2 international, 0 domestic | Good | V.C.
