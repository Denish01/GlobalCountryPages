[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Antigua and Barbuda is generally reliable, with an average internet speed of 10 Mbps download, which is sufficient for most online activities such as browsing, emailing, and social media. However, there is a notable urban-rural divide, with faster internet speeds and better mobile network coverage available in urban areas such as St. John's, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall internet infrastructure is well-developed, and most users can expect a stable and reliable connection.

The government of Antigua and Barbuda has made efforts to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the implementation of a national broadband network and the introduction of new mobile network technologies. As a result, the internet has become an essential tool for businesses, education, and everyday life in Antigua and Barbuda. However, the lack of 5G network coverage may be a limitation for some users, particularly those who require high-speed internet for applications such as online gaming or video streaming.
