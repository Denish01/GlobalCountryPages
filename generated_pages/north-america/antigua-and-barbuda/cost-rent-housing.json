Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected under the **Rent Restriction Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda's housing costs are relatively moderate, with a slightly higher cost of living. However, the country's **tourist-based economy** and limited housing supply can drive up prices, especially in popular areas like St. John's.\n\nThe housing market in Antigua and Barbuda is also influenced by the **seasonal demand** from tourists and expats, which can lead to higher prices during the peak season (December to April). Additionally, the country's **limited land availability** and **strict building regulations** can contribute to higher property prices, especially in prime locations like the city center. Despite these factors, the country's **stable economy** and **high standard of living** make it an attractive destination for expats and investors.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $900-$1,200 | $600-$900 | basic amenities, 1-2 rooms |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,500 | $700-$1,200 | standard quality, 1-2 bathrooms |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,000 | $900-$1,600 | family size, 2-3 bathrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$2,000 | spacious, 3-4 bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$4,000 | prime locations, ocean views |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | residential areas, amenities nearby |\n| Rural | $800-$1,500 | countryside, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **St. John's**: the capital city, with a range of amenities and services, typical rent range $1,000-$2,000 USD per month\n- **English Harbour**: a popular area for expats, with a range of restaurants and shops, typical rent range $1,200-$2,500 USD per month\n- **Falmouth**: a coastal town with a relaxed atmosphere, typical rent range $800-$1,800 USD per month\n- **Dickenson Bay**: a popular area for tourists, with a range of amenities and services, typical rent range $1,000-$2,500 USD per month\n- **Jolly Harbour**: a residential area with a range of amenities, typical rent range $800-$2,000 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Antigua and Barbuda [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Be prepared to negotiate prices, especially for long-term rentals\n- Be aware of **scams** and **hidden fees**, and always inspect the property before signing a lease\n- Utilities are usually not included in the rent, and tenants are responsible for paying for electricity, water, and internet\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, and tenants may need to provide their own appliances and furniture\n- Consider purchasing **rental insurance** to protect against damages and losses",
