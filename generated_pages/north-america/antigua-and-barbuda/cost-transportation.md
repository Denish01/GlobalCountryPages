Getting around Antigua and Barbuda is relatively easy, with a range of transportation options available. The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and rental cars, with most people opting for taxis or renting cars due to the limited public transportation system. The quality of public transit is decent, with buses running regularly between major towns and cities, but the coverage is limited and often crowded. The country's small size and lack of traffic congestion make it an ideal place to explore by car, and many tourists choose to rent a car for the duration of their stay.
