[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Antigua and Barbuda is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical staff and adequate facilities, especially in the capital city of St. John's. However, the quality of care can vary significantly between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having more limited access to specialized services. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with several high-quality hospitals and clinics catering to locals and tourists alike.

The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the public healthcare system, which includes a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics. The public system provides a range of services, including emergency care, surgical services, and outpatient clinics. However, the public system can be overwhelmed at times, and wait times for non-emergency procedures can be long. In contrast, the private sector offers a more comprehensive range of services, including specialized care and advanced diagnostic facilities.

Despite the overall good quality of care, there are some challenges facing the healthcare system in Antigua and Barbuda. One of the main challenges is the shortage of specialized medical staff, particularly in rural areas. Additionally, the healthcare system can be quite expensive, especially for foreigners who are not covered by the public system.
