The country's closest neighbors are Saint Kitts and Nevis to the northwest, and Montserrat to the southwest. The island nation is a popular tourist destination due to its beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant culture.

The landscape of Antigua and Barbuda has been shaped by its geological history, with volcanic activity and erosion creating the islands' unique terrain. The islands are also home to a number of caves, including the famous Hell's Gate cave on Antigua, which features stunning rock formations and underground pools.
