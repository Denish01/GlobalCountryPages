The system is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with 12 years of compulsory education. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality can vary, with some schools facing issues with infrastructure and resources. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a higher cost. International schools are also available, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).\n\nThe quality of education in Antigua and Barbuda is generally considered to be good, with a literacy rate of around 95%. However, there are some challenges facing the education system, including a lack of resources and infrastructure in some public schools. Despite these challenges, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with an increase in the number of students pursuing higher education. The government has also implemented initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and the provision of training for teachers.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, varying quality |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Higher quality, smaller class sizes |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, varying quality |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Higher quality, smaller class sizes |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | IB, CIE, and other international curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $2,000-$4,000 | $4,000-$6,000 | University of the West Indies (UWI) |\n| Private University | $4,000-$6,000 | $6,000-$8,000 | American University of Antigua (AUA) |\n| Top-Ranked University | $6,000-$8,000 | $8,000-$10,000 | University of the West Indies (UWI) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Limited availability, varying quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Available for various subjects |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | English, Spanish, and other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, including textbooks and materials |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats are generally private and international schools, which offer a higher quality of education and a more international curriculum.\n- Scholarships are available for local and international students, including the Antigua and Barbuda Scholarship and the Caribbean Scholarship.\n- Online learning options are limited, but some universities and institutions offer online courses and degree programs.\n- The education quality in Antigua and Barbuda is generally considered to be good, but can vary depending on the institution and the level of study.\n- It is recommended to research schools and institutions thoroughly before making a decision, and to consider factors such as curriculum, teaching style, and extracurricular activities.\n- The University of the West Indies (UWI) is a top-ranked university in the region, and offers a range of undergraduate and graduate programs.",
