The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and rental cars, with most people opting for taxis or renting cars due to the limited public transportation system. The quality of public transit is decent, with buses running regularly between major towns and cities, but the coverage is limited and often crowded. The country's small size and lack of traffic congestion make it an ideal place to explore by car, and many tourists choose to rent a car for the duration of their stay.\n\nThe public transportation system in Antigua and Barbuda is primarily made up of buses and minibuses, which run on fixed routes and schedules. While the system is reliable, it can be slow and may not always be convenient for tourists. Many locals rely on taxis and ride-hailing services to get around, which are widely available and relatively affordable. The country's airport, V.C. Bird International Airport, is located near the capital city of St. John's and offers a range of transportation options, including taxis, buses, and car rentals.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1.50 | $60 | Limited coverage, crowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2.00 | N/A | Runs on fixed routes, can be crowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5.00 | $2.00 | $10-$15 | Widely available |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3.00 | $1.50 | $8-$12 | Uber, Hailo available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depends on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depends on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | No toll roads in Antigua and Barbuda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited options, can be slow |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | From Antigua to Barbuda, depends on airline |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or renting a car for the duration of your stay.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Hailo to get around, as they are widely available and relatively affordable.\n- Always negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting your journey, as they may not always use meters.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially when using public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car with a reputable agency, as this can be a cost-effective and convenient way to explore the country.\n- Use online resources or apps to plan your route and stay up-to-date on traffic and road conditions.",
