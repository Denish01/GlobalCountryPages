  "content": "Healthcare in Antigua and Barbuda is a mixed system that offers a range of public and private services, with generally good quality of care, especially in urban areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 911\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Antigua and Barbuda is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical staff and adequate facilities, especially in the capital city of St. John's. However, the quality of care can vary significantly between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having more limited access to specialized services. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with several high-quality hospitals and clinics catering to locals and tourists alike.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the public healthcare system, which includes a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics. The public system provides a range of services, including emergency care, surgical services, and outpatient clinics. However, the public system can be overwhelmed at times, and wait times for non-emergency procedures can be long. In contrast, the private sector offers a more comprehensive range of services, including specialized care and advanced diagnostic facilities.\n\nDespite the overall good quality of care, there are some challenges facing the healthcare system in Antigua and Barbuda. One of the main challenges is the shortage of specialized medical staff, particularly in rural areas. Additionally, the healthcare system can be quite expensive, especially for foreigners who are not covered by the public system.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mount St. John's Medical Centre | St. John's | Public | Emergency, surgical, medical | Yes |\n| Adelin Medical Centre | St. John's | Private | General practice, specialist clinics | Yes |\n| Fitzroy Medical Centre | St. John's | Private | General practice, dental, optical | Yes |\n| Holberton Hospital | St. John's | Public | Emergency, medical, surgical | Yes |\n| Sir Lester Bird Medical Centre | St. John's | Public | Specialist clinics, outpatient services | Yes |\n| Barbuda Hospital | Codrington | Public | Emergency, medical, surgical | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it provides access to a wider range of services and facilities.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Coverage for expats** can be purchased through international insurance companies, which often have partnerships with local providers.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the level of coverage and the provider.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended, as it can provide emergency medical coverage and evacuation services.\n- **Group insurance plans** may be available for companies and organizations, which can provide more comprehensive coverage at a lower cost.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available at pharmacies and hospitals, including prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but most medications require a prescription from a licensed medical practitioner.\n- **Common brands** are available, including international brands and generic equivalents.\n- **Costs** can vary, but many medications are subsidized by the government.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies located throughout the country, especially in urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid, which are recommended for all travelers.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include influenza, meningitis, and rabies, which may be recommended depending on the individual's circumstances.\n- **Endemic diseases** include dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus, which are all present in the country.\n- **Water safety** is generally good, but it's recommended to drink bottled or filtered water to minimize the risk of water-borne illnesses.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, but it's recommended to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and seafood.\n- **Sun protection** is essential, as the sun can be intense in the Caribbean.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, dental procedures, and orthopedic surgery, which are often cheaper than in the US or Europe.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Mount St. John's Medical Centre and the Adelin Medical Centre, which have international accreditation.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with some procedures costing up to 50% less than in the US or Europe.\n- **Follow-up care** is often included in the cost of the procedure, which can provide peace of mind for patients.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 911, which is available 24/7.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, but response times can vary depending on the location.\n- **Nearest hospitals** are listed in the table above, which includes public and private facilities.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, so it's recommended to contact your insurance provider as soon as possible to initiate the claims process.\n- **Emergency care** is generally good, but it's recommended to have a plan in place in case of an emergency, including a list of emergency contacts and a means of communication.",
