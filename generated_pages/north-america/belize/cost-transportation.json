The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and cities. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in rural areas can make it difficult for people to get around without a car. Most people in Belize rely on public buses or shared taxis to get around, which are affordable and widely available. In tourist areas, rental cars and taxis are also popular options, offering a more convenient and flexible way to travel.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Belize are road-based, with a network of highways and rural roads connecting major towns and cities. The country's public transportation system is relatively well-developed, with bus services operated by private companies and the government. However, the quality of roads can vary greatly, with some rural areas having poorly maintained roads that can make travel difficult. Despite these challenges, getting around Belize is relatively easy, with many transportation options available to suit different budgets and preferences.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1-$2 | $30-$50 | Good coverage in major towns and cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Belize |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$5 | N/A | Frequent services on main routes |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Belize |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2-$5 | $1-$2 | $5-$10 | Available in major towns and cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3-$5 | $1-$2 | $5-$10 | Local alternatives to Uber, such as Belize Shuttle |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $25-$50 | To Belize City or other major towns |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Regular fuel |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00-$1.30 | Diesel fuel |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in some areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Some roads, especially highways, have tolls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Frequent services on main routes |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | From Belize City to other major towns |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Belize |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or shared taxis, which are affordable and widely available.\n- Use local ride-hailing apps, such as Belize Shuttle, instead of traditional taxis to get a better rate.\n- Always negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before you start your journey to avoid overcharging.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for long-distance travel or to explore rural areas, but be aware of the costs and road conditions.\n- Use reputable and licensed transportation services to ensure your safety, especially at night or in unfamiliar areas.",
