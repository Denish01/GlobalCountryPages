# Best Time to Visit Belize — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Belize is during the dry season, from December to May, when the weather is pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and exploring the jungle.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Belize: December to May. Peak season: January to April. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: September to November due to the increased risk of hurricanes and tropical storms. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Belize has a subtropical climate with two distinct seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by low humidity, gentle breezes, and plenty of sunshine. This is the best time to visit Belize, as the weather is perfect for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and exploring the jungle. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by high humidity, heavy rainfall, and an increased risk of hurricanes and tropical storms. During this time, some tourist facilities and attractions may be closed, and travel can be more challenging.

The climate in Belize varies depending on the region. The coastal areas tend to be hotter and more humid than the interior, while the mountainous regions are cooler and more temperate. The Cayo District, which is located in the western part of the country, has a slightly cooler climate than the rest of Belize, making it a popular destination for those looking to escape the heat.

The seasons in Belize also affect the travel experience. During the dry season, the roads are easier to navigate, and the tourist attractions are more accessible. However, this is also the peak tourist season, and popular destinations can be crowded. During the wet season, the roads can be more challenging to navigate, and some tourist attractions may be closed. However, this is also the best time to see the country's lush vegetation and vibrant wildlife.
