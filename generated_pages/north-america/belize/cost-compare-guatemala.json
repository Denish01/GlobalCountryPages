Belize has a more developed tourism industry and a higher GDP per capita, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Guatemala, on the other hand, has a larger population and a more diverse economy, with a stronger focus on agriculture and manufacturing. The cost of living in Guatemala is generally lower, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper than in Belize. However, Belize offers a more stable and secure environment, with lower crime rates and a more developed infrastructure.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Belize has a relatively small economy, with a strong focus on tourism and foreign investment. This has led to a higher demand for goods and services, driving up prices. Guatemala, on the other hand, has a larger and more diverse economy, with a stronger focus on domestic production and consumption. This has helped to keep prices lower, making it a more attractive option for those looking for a lower cost of living. Overall, Guatemala is generally cheaper than Belize, with an estimated 20-30% lower cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belize (USD) | Guatemala (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $800 | $400 | 50% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $500 | $250 | 50% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $1,200 | $800 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belize (USD) | Guatemala (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $15 | $10 | 33% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $70 | 30% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $3 | $2 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $2 | $1.50 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belize (USD) | Guatemala (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $50 | $30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1.50 | $1 | 33% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1 | 17% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belize (USD) | Guatemala (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $150 | $100 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $20 | $15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Belize (USD) | Guatemala (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $1,200 | $800 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | $2,000 | $1,500 | 25% |\n| Comfortable | $3,000 | $2,500 | 17% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Belize is cheaper for:**\n- High-end tourism activities, such as snorkeling and diving trips\n- Luxury accommodations and resorts\n- International cuisine and fine dining\n- High-speed internet and modern amenities\n- **Guatemala is cheaper for:**\n- Local transportation and public transit\n- Traditional cuisine and street food\n- Accommodation options, including hostels and guesthouses\n- Outdoor activities, such as hiking and volcano climbing\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nBelize and Guatemala offer distinct advantages and disadvantages when it comes to cost of living.
