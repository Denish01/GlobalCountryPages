[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Belize is located in Central America, bordering the Caribbean Sea to the east, and nestled between Mexico to the north and Guatemala to the south and west. The country's strategic position allows it to serve as a bridge between the Caribbean and Central America, with the Caribbean Sea providing a coastline of approximately 386 kilometers. Belize is part of the Mesoamerican region, which includes countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.

The country's borders with Mexico and Guatemala are defined by natural features such as rivers and mountains. The border with Mexico is marked by the Hondo River, while the border with Guatemala is defined by the Sarstoon River. Belize's coastline along the Caribbean Sea provides a unique blend of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, with the Belize Barrier Reef, the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, running parallel to the coast. The country's location and geography make it a popular destination for tourists and a hub for international trade.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Belize's terrain is characterized by a mix of coastal plains, mountains, and forests. The country's landscape is dominated by the Maya Mountains, which run through the center of the country and reach elevations of over 1,000 meters. The mountains are covered in a lush tropical forest, with a diverse array of flora and fauna. The coastal plains, on the other hand, are generally flat and low-lying, with many areas being prone to flooding during the rainy season.

The country's coastline is marked by a series of coral reefs, atolls, and islands, including the famous Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker. The Belize Barrier Reef, which runs for over 300 kilometers, is home to a vast array of marine life, including sea turtles, stingrays, and colorful fish. The reef is also an important breeding ground for many species of fish and is a popular destination for scuba divers and snorkelers. In addition to its coastal features, Belize is also home to several major rivers, including the Belize River, which flows through the country's largest city, Belize City.

The country's forests are also an important feature of its landscape, with many areas being protected as national parks and wildlife reserves. The forests are home to a diverse array of wildlife, including jaguars, ocelots, and howler monkeys. The forests also provide important ecosystem services, including water filtration and carbon sequestration. Overall, Belize's terrain and landscape are characterized by a rich diversity of ecosystems, each with its own unique features and attractions.
