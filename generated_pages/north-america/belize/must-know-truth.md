# The Truth About Belize - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Belize, formerly known as British Honduras, has a rich and diverse history dating back to the **Maya civilization**. The Maya inhabited the region from 2000 BCE to 1500 CE, leaving behind a legacy of architecture, art, and culture. In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors arrived, but they failed to establish a strong presence in the region. Instead, British pirates and settlers began to inhabit the area, and by the mid-17th century, the British had established a foothold in Belize. The British government officially declared Belize a colony in 1862, and it remained under British rule until gaining independence on September 21, 1981.

The country's strategic location and natural resources made it an attractive location for various groups, including the British, Spanish, and African slaves. The African influence is still evident in Belize's **Garifuna culture**, which emerged in the 19th century as a result of the intermingling of African, Caribbean, and indigenous peoples. Today, Belize is a **sovereign nation** and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, with a diverse population and a unique cultural identity.

Belize's history is also marked by its complex relationship with its neighbors, Mexico and Guatemala. The country's borders were established through a series of treaties and agreements, including the **Treaty of Paris** in 1783 and the **Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty** in 1859. These agreements have had a lasting impact on Belize's territorial boundaries and its relationships with its neighbors.

The country's journey to independence was a long and complex process, with Belize becoming a **self-governing colony** in 1964 and eventually gaining full independence in 1981. Today, Belize is a **parliamentary democracy** and a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
