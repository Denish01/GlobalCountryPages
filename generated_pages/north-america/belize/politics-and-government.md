[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Belize operates under a system of **separation of powers**, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each playing a distinct role. The **executive branch**, headed by the prime minister, is responsible for the administration of the government, while the **legislative branch**, composed of the National Assembly, makes the laws. The **judicial branch**, comprising the Supreme Court and lower courts, interprets the laws. Belize is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and no federal divisions.

The political system in Belize is designed to ensure accountability and representation. The National Assembly, the country's legislature, is composed of two houses: the **House of Representatives**, with 31 members elected by universal adult suffrage, and the **Senate**, with 13 members appointed by the governor-general. The prime minister is the head of government and is responsible for advising the governor-general on the exercise of the monarch's powers.

The system of government in Belize is based on the **Westminster model**, with a strong emphasis on parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law. The country's constitution, which came into effect in 1981, sets out the framework for the government and the relationship between the different branches of power.
