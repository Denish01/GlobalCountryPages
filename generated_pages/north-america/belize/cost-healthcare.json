  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Belize can vary significantly depending on whether you opt for public or private services, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often having longer wait times and limited resources, while private healthcare offers more comprehensive and prompt care at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $309 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 26.8% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: BZD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nBelize has a mixed healthcare system, comprising both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable and accessible to locals, with most medical services being free or low-cost. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and availability of resources. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers more comprehensive and prompt care, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it provides more reliable and efficient services. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be significant.\n\nThe healthcare system in Belize is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for regulating and coordinating healthcare services across the country. Public healthcare services are generally provided by government-run hospitals and clinics, while private healthcare services are offered by private hospitals, clinics, and medical facilities. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary source of medical care, while foreigners tend to opt for private healthcare services due to concerns about quality and availability of care. In general, the mixed healthcare system in Belize provides a range of options for both locals and foreigners, but it is essential to have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by dentist's qualifications and location |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by optometrist's qualifications and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by laboratory and test complexity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of accommodation |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon's experience |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and scan complexity |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers comprehensive medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers international medical services, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies across Belize, with prices varying by medication and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, with prices ranging from $5 to $20.\n- Common medications like antibiotics and painkillers can cost between $10 to $30.\n- Pharmacy services are generally available in urban areas, with limited services in rural areas.\n- Prescription rules vary by medication and doctor's qualifications, with some medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- Medication prices can vary by pharmacy and location, with prices often being higher in tourist areas.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 911, or visit the nearest hospital or clinic.
