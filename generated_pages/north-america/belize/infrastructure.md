# Belize Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Belize's infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with a mix of modern and outdated systems, particularly in rural areas, where access to basic services like electricity, water, and telecommunications can be limited.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 92% of population
Internet Penetration: 45%
Road Network: 3,281 km, mostly paved but with some gravel and dirt roads
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 5
Major Ports: 4
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Belize's infrastructure development level is generally considered to be lower-middle-income country status, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's transportation network, energy sector, and telecommunications. However, there is still a notable urban-rural gap, with cities like Belize City and Belmopan enjoying better access to modern infrastructure, while rural areas often struggle with limited connectivity and basic services. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on sustainable development and environmental protection. Despite these efforts, challenges such as lack of funding, limited technical capacity, and vulnerability to natural disasters remain significant obstacles to infrastructure development in Belize.

The country's infrastructure has been impacted by various factors, including its geography, climate, and economic conditions. Belize is a small country with a diverse geography, featuring a long coastline, dense forests, and mountainous terrain, which can make it difficult and costly to build and maintain infrastructure. The country is also prone to natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and droughts, which can damage or destroy infrastructure and disrupt essential services. To address these challenges, the government has been working to develop more resilient and sustainable infrastructure, including climate-resilient road networks, renewable energy systems, and flood-resistant buildings.

In recent years, Belize has seen significant investments in its infrastructure, particularly in the transportation sector. The government has upgraded several major highways, including the Philip Goldson Highway and the George Price Highway, and has improved the country's airport and seaport facilities. These investments have helped to boost economic growth, improve connectivity, and enhance the overall quality of life for Belizeans. However, more work is needed to address the country's infrastructure gaps, particularly in rural areas, where access to basic services like electricity, water, and telecommunications remains limited.

- The **reliability of the electricity supply** is generally good, but outages can occur, particularly during peak demand periods or in areas with outdated infrastructure.
- **Renewable energy** is becoming increasingly important in Belize, with several solar and wind power projects underway, aiming to reduce the country's dependence on imported fuels.
- The **energy sector** is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission, which oversees the provision of electricity, water, and telecommunications services.
- **Energy efficiency** is a growing concern in Belize, with efforts to promote the use of energy-efficient appliances and practices, particularly in the tourism sector.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water safety** is a concern in some areas, particularly in rural communities where water treatment facilities may be inadequate.
- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with most households having access to improved sanitation facilities, although there are still some disparities between urban and rural areas.
- **Water access** is generally good, with most households having access to piped water or other improved water sources, although some rural communities may rely on wells or rainwater harvesting.
- The **water sector** is managed by the Belize Water Services, which is responsible for providing water and sanitation services to most of the country.
- **Water conservation** is becoming increasingly important in Belize, with efforts to promote efficient use of water resources, particularly in the agriculture and tourism sectors.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- **Mobile coverage** is relatively good, with most areas having access to mobile phone services, although coverage can be limited in some rural areas.
- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in some areas, particularly in urban centers, although internet penetration rates are still relatively low compared to other countries in the region.
- The **4G/5G rollout** is underway, with several mobile operators offering high-speed internet services in major towns and cities.
- **Postal services** are provided by the Belize Postal Service, which offers a range of services, including mail delivery, parcel post, and money transfer.
- **Telecommunications regulation** is overseen by the Public Utilities Commission, which ensures that telecommunications services are provided in a fair and competitive manner.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The **Belize City Southside Poverty Reduction Project** aims to improve living conditions and access to basic services in one of the city's most disadvantaged areas.
- The **Rural Electrification Project** seeks to expand electricity access to rural communities, using a combination of grid extension and off-grid renewable energy solutions.
- The **Belize Transportation Master Plan** is a comprehensive plan to upgrade the country's transportation network, including roads, airports, and seaports.
- The **Belize Water Sector Investment Plan** aims to improve the country's water and sanitation infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities.
- The **Belize Climate Resilience Project** is a major initiative to enhance the country's resilience to climate change, including investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, disaster risk reduction, and environmental protection.
