Typical lease terms in Belize are 6-12 months, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights in Belize are protected by law, and tenants have the right to a written lease agreement and to receive a refund of their deposit when they move out. Compared to its regional neighbors, Mexico and Guatemala, Belize's housing costs are relatively high, but the country's high standard of living and relatively low cost of living make it an attractive option for expats and tourists.\n\nThe housing market in Belize is also influenced by the country's tourism industry, with many properties being rented out on a short-term basis to tourists. This can drive up prices and make it more difficult for long-term renters to find affordable housing. However, there are still many affordable options available, particularly outside of the city center. Additionally, the government of Belize has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, which is expected to help stabilize the market and make housing more accessible to low-income families.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $500-$800 | $300-$600 | small, basic apartments |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | typical quality, 1-2 bedrooms |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,000 | $800-$1,400 | family size, 2-3 bedrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$3,000 | $1,200-$2,200 | spacious, 3-4 bedrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$4,000 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$3,000 | residential areas, moderate demand |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,000 | rural areas, low demand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Belmopan**: the capital city, with a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, and a typical rent range of $800-$1,500 USD per month\n- **Placencia**: a popular tourist destination, with a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, and a typical rent range of $600-$1,200 USD per month\n- **Ambergris Caye**: a popular island destination, with a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, and a typical rent range of $1,000-$2,500 USD per month\n- **Corozal**: a charming town in northern Belize, with a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, and a typical rent range of $400-$900 USD per month\n- **Caye Caulker**: a small island destination, with a range of housing options, from apartments to houses, and a typical rent range of $600-$1,200 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Belize [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and compare prices to find the best deals\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a property that meets your needs\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease\n- Make sure to inspect the property carefully before signing a lease\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment, as this can be more convenient and cost-effective\n- Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit or rent without seeing the property first and signing a lease agreement\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so be sure to factor these costs into your budget\n- Consider renting outside of the city center, as prices can be significantly lower in suburban and rural areas",
