[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Belize's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector catering to the majority of the population. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the system can be underfunded and overcrowded, particularly in rural areas. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but are generally more expensive. Urban areas, such as Belize City and Belmopan, have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often rely on smaller clinics and community health workers.

The quality of care in Belize is generally good, with many medical professionals trained in the United States or other developed countries. However, the system can be limited by a lack of specialized care and equipment, particularly in rural areas. Patients often travel to Belize City or other urban areas for more complex medical procedures. The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system and ensuring that all citizens have access to basic healthcare services.

Despite the challenges, Belize has made significant strides in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on preventive care and community-based health services. The country has also implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those living in poverty.
