[SECTION] Overview: Belize vs Mexico [/SECTION]
Belize and Mexico are two neighboring countries in North America that offer distinct cultural and economic experiences. Belize, with its small population and limited economy, tends to have higher prices for everyday items, while Mexico, with its larger economy and more developed infrastructure, generally offers lower prices. The main reason for this difference is the size and diversity of Mexico's economy, which allows for more competition and lower prices. In contrast, Belize's smaller market and limited supply chain contribute to higher costs.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost levels. Mexico has a more diversified economy, with a strong manufacturing sector, a large agricultural sector, and a growing service sector. Belize, on the other hand, has a smaller economy that is heavily reliant on tourism and agriculture. As a result, Mexico's economy is more resilient to external shocks and can offer more competitive prices. Overall, Mexico is generally cheaper than Belize, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall living costs. However, Belize offers a unique cultural experience and a more laid-back lifestyle that may be worth the extra cost for some expats and tourists.
