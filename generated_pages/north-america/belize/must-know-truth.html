        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Belize, formerly known as British Honduras, has a rich and diverse history dating back to the <strong>Maya civilization</strong>. The Maya inhabited the region from 2000 BCE to 1500 CE, leaving behind a legacy of architecture, art, and culture. In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors arrived, but they failed to establish a strong presence in the region. Instead, British pirates and settlers began to inhabit the area, and by the mid-17th century, the British had established a foothold in Belize. The British government officially declared Belize a colony in 1862, and it remained under British rule until gaining independence on September 21, 1981.</p>
        <p>The country's strategic location and natural resources made it an attractive location for various groups, including the British, Spanish, and African slaves. The African influence is still evident in Belize's <strong>Garifuna culture</strong>, which emerged in the 19th century as a result of the intermingling of African, Caribbean, and indigenous peoples. Today, Belize is a <strong>sovereign nation</strong> and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, with a diverse population and a unique cultural identity.</p>
        <p>Belize's history is also marked by its complex relationship with its neighbors, Mexico and Guatemala. The country's borders were established through a series of treaties and agreements, including the <strong>Treaty of Paris</strong> in 1783 and the <strong>Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty</strong> in 1859. These agreements have had a lasting impact on Belize's territorial boundaries and its relationships with its neighbors.</p>
        <p>The country's journey to independence was a long and complex process, with Belize becoming a <strong>self-governing colony</strong> in 1964 and eventually gaining full independence in 1981. Today, Belize is a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> and a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations and the Organization of American States.</p>
