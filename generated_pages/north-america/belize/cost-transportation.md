[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Belize offers a range of transportation options, including public buses, taxis, and rental cars. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major towns and cities. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in rural areas can make it difficult for people to get around without a car. Most people in Belize rely on public buses or shared taxis to get around, which are affordable and widely available. In tourist areas, rental cars and taxis are also popular options, offering a more convenient and flexible way to travel.

The main transportation modes in Belize are road-based, with a network of highways and rural roads connecting major towns and cities. The country's public transportation system is relatively well-developed, with bus services operated by private companies and the government. However, the quality of roads can vary greatly, with some rural areas having poorly maintained roads that can make travel difficult. Despite these challenges, getting around Belize is relatively easy, with many transportation options available to suit different budgets and preferences.
