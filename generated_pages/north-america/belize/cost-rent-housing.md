[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Belize is relatively small, but it is growing due to the increasing popularity of the country as a tourist and expat destination. Typical lease terms in Belize are 6-12 months, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights in Belize are protected by law, and tenants have the right to a written lease agreement and to receive a refund of their deposit when they move out. Compared to its regional neighbors, Mexico and Guatemala, Belize's housing costs are relatively high, but the country's high standard of living and relatively low cost of living make it an attractive option for expats and tourists.

The housing market in Belize is also influenced by the country's tourism industry, with many properties being rented out on a short-term basis to tourists. This can drive up prices and make it more difficult for long-term renters to find affordable housing. However, there are still many affordable options available, particularly outside of the city center. Additionally, the government of Belize has implemented initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, which is expected to help stabilize the market and make housing more accessible to low-income families.
