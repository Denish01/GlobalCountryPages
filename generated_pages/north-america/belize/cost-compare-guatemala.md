[SECTION] Overview: Belize vs Guatemala [/SECTION]
Belize and Guatemala are two neighboring countries in Central America with distinct economic profiles. Belize has a more developed tourism industry and a higher GDP per capita, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Guatemala, on the other hand, has a larger population and a more diverse economy, with a stronger focus on agriculture and manufacturing. The cost of living in Guatemala is generally lower, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper than in Belize. However, Belize offers a more stable and secure environment, with lower crime rates and a more developed infrastructure.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Belize has a relatively small economy, with a strong focus on tourism and foreign investment. This has led to a higher demand for goods and services, driving up prices. Guatemala, on the other hand, has a larger and more diverse economy, with a stronger focus on domestic production and consumption. This has helped to keep prices lower, making it a more attractive option for those looking for a lower cost of living. Overall, Guatemala is generally cheaper than Belize, with an estimated 20-30% lower cost of living.
