[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Curacao is easily accessible by air, with Hato International Airport (CUR) being the main entry point for most visitors. The airport is located about 12 kilometers northwest of the capital city, Willemstad, and receives direct flights from several major hubs in the Americas and Europe, including Amsterdam, Miami, and Panama City. If you're coming from nearby islands, such as Aruba or Bonaire, you can also take a ferry or a short flight. Overland entry points are limited, as Curacao is an island, but you can arrive by sea on a cruise ship or a private boat.

The main airport is well-connected to many international destinations, and you can find flights operated by major carriers such as KLM, American Airlines, and Copa Airlines. Additionally, some airlines offer seasonal flights to Curacao, so it's a good idea to check with your preferred airline for the latest schedules and fares. If you're planning to visit during peak season, it's recommended to book your flights well in advance to secure the best rates.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Curacao has a limited domestic air network, with only a few flights per week connecting the island to other destinations in the Dutch Caribbean. The main domestic airline is Divi Divi Air, which operates flights between Curacao and Bonaire, as well as some charter flights to other nearby islands. Booking domestic flights can be done online or through a local travel agent, and approximate costs can range from $100 to $200 USD per person for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Curacao does not have a rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the island. This is not uncommon for small island nations, where the focus is often on road and sea transportation. As a result, visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to explore the island.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
The public bus system in Curacao is operated by **Konvoi**, which offers an extensive network of routes covering most areas of the island. Buses are a convenient and affordable way to get around, with fares starting from around $1 USD per ride. You can pay the driver in cash, and some buses also accept credit cards. The bus network is relatively frequent, with buses running from early morning to late evening, although the frequency may be reduced on weekends and holidays.
