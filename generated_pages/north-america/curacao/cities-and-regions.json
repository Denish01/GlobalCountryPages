The island is divided into several neighborhoods or districts for local administration purposes, but these do not have the same level of autonomy as states or provinces in other countries. The capital city of Willemstad serves as the economic and cultural hub of the island, and is home to many of the island's government offices, businesses, and cultural institutions. The island's small size and relatively simple administrative structure make it easy to navigate and get around.\n\nThe lack of administrative divisions in Curacao also reflects the island's history as a Dutch colony, where the central government in Willemstad has traditionally played a strong role in governing the island. Today, the island has a significant degree of autonomy, but the Dutch government still maintains some responsibility for defense and foreign affairs. This unique arrangement has helped to shape the island's culture and identity, with a blend of Dutch, African, and indigenous influences.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Willemstad** (140,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center, port city\nKnown For: its colorful colonial architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and rich history, with a mix of Dutch, African, and indigenous influences\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and shopping, as well as those looking for a vibrant nightlife and dining scene\n**Sint Michiel** (20,000)\nRole: economic hub, industrial center\nKnown For: its industrial park, which is home to a number of major companies and manufacturing facilities, as well as its beautiful beaches and scenic coastline\nBest For: visitors interested in business and industry, as well as those looking for a more laid-back, coastal experience\n**Boca Sami** (10,000)\nRole: coastal town, tourist center\nKnown For: its beautiful beaches, scenic coastline, and outdoor recreational opportunities, including snorkeling, diving, and hiking\nBest For: visitors interested in outdoor activities, nature, and relaxation\n**Sabana Westpunt** (5,000)\nRole: coastal town, tourist center\nKnown For: its beautiful beaches, scenic coastline, and outdoor recreational opportunities, including snorkeling, diving, and hiking\nBest For: visitors interested in outdoor activities, nature, and relaxation\n**Dorp Soto** (5,000)\nRole: suburban town, residential area\nKnown For: its quiet, residential atmosphere, and its proximity to Willemstad and other urban areas\nBest For: visitors looking for a more laid-back, suburban experience, with easy access to urban amenities\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Willemstad | urban, cosmopolitan | historic architecture, cultural events, shopping | Willemstad |\n| Sint Michiel | industrial, commercial | industrial park, manufacturing facilities, beaches | Sint Michiel |\n| Southeastern Coast | coastal, tourist | beaches, scenic coastline, outdoor recreation | Boca Sami |\n| Northwestern Coast | coastal, tourist | beaches, scenic coastline, outdoor recreation | Sabana Westpunt |\n| Central Highlands | rural, natural | scenic countryside, hiking, birdwatching | Dorp Soto |\n| Christoffelberg | natural, protected | Christoffelberg National Park, hiking, wildlife |  |\n| Jan Thiel | coastal, tourist | beaches, scenic coastline, outdoor recreation |  |\n| Vaersenbaai | industrial, commercial | industrial park, manufacturing facilities, beaches |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The northern and southern parts of the island have different cultural and economic profiles, with the north being more urban and developed, and the south being more rural and natural\n- The coastal regions are generally more tourist-oriented, with a focus on beaches, outdoor recreation, and scenic coastline\n- The interior of the island is more rural and natural, with a focus on agriculture, conservation, and outdoor recreation\n- The language and cultural practices also vary across regions, with Papiamento being more widely spoken in the north, and Dutch being more widely spoken in the south\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nCuracao has a well-developed transportation network, with a number of options for getting around the island.
