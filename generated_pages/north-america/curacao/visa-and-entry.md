# Curacao Visa & Entry Requirements

You will likely need a visa to enter Curacao, depending on your nationality, but some countries are exempt from visa requirements or can obtain one upon arrival.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Curacao before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Curacao has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visa applications for different nationalities. Citizens of around 60 countries can enter Curacao without a visa, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain one upon arrival. The visa-free access is mainly granted to citizens of European countries, as well as some countries in the Americas and Asia.

The government of Curacao aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel to the island, while also maintaining strict controls to ensure the security and integrity of its borders. As a result, the visa policy is subject to change, and it is essential to check the latest requirements before planning a trip to Curacao.
