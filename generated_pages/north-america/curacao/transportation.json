  "content": "To get around in Curacao, you can use a combination of taxis, buses, and rental cars, as well as explore the island on foot or by bike, taking advantage of the various transportation options available.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Hato International Airport, CUR\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nCuracao is easily accessible by air, with Hato International Airport (CUR) being the main entry point for most visitors. The airport is located about 12 kilometers northwest of the capital city, Willemstad, and receives direct flights from several major hubs in the Americas and Europe, including Amsterdam, Miami, and Panama City. If you're coming from nearby islands, such as Aruba or Bonaire, you can also take a ferry or a short flight. Overland entry points are limited, as Curacao is an island, but you can arrive by sea on a cruise ship or a private boat.\n\nThe main airport is well-connected to many international destinations, and you can find flights operated by major carriers such as KLM, American Airlines, and Copa Airlines. Additionally, some airlines offer seasonal flights to Curacao, so it's a good idea to check with your preferred airline for the latest schedules and fares. If you're planning to visit during peak season, it's recommended to book your flights well in advance to secure the best rates.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nCuracao has a limited domestic air network, with only a few flights per week connecting the island to other destinations in the Dutch Caribbean. The main domestic airline is Divi Divi Air, which operates flights between Curacao and Bonaire, as well as some charter flights to other nearby islands. Booking domestic flights can be done online or through a local travel agent, and approximate costs can range from $100 to $200 USD per person for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nCuracao does not have a rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the island. This is not uncommon for small island nations, where the focus is often on road and sea transportation. As a result, visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to explore the island.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThe public bus system in Curacao is operated by **Konvoi**, which offers an extensive network of routes covering most areas of the island. Buses are a convenient and affordable way to get around, with fares starting from around $1 USD per ride. You can pay the driver in cash, and some buses also accept credit cards. The bus network is relatively frequent, with buses running from early morning to late evening, although the frequency may be reduced on weekends and holidays.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Willemstad, other towns | $1-$2 | Frequent routes, cash and credit cards accepted |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $10-$20 | Metered fares, available at taxi stands or by phone |\n| Ride-Hailing | Willemstad, major towns | $5-$10 | Local alternatives to Uber, such as **CuraCab** |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Not available | - | - |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Curacao, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, which is accepted for up to three months.\n- The road quality in Curacao is generally good, with most major roads paved and well-maintained.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, with gasoline prices averaging around $1.50 USD per liter.\n- Car rental companies are widely available at the airport and in major towns, with prices starting from around $40 USD per day for a compact car.\n- When driving in Curacao, be aware of the **right-hand traffic** rule and watch out for pedestrians and cyclists, especially in urban areas.\n- Parking can be limited in Willemstad and other popular areas, so it's a good idea to plan ahead and consider using parking garages or lots.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be sure to agree on the fare with your taxi driver before starting your journey, as some drivers may not use meters.\n- When using public buses, have exact change ready, as drivers may not accept large bills.\n- Download the **CuraCab** app for easy ride-hailing in Willemstad and other major towns.\n- Be mindful of your belongings, especially in crowded areas or tourist hotspots, and keep an eye out for **scams** targeting visitors.\n- Consider purchasing a **local SIM card** or portable Wi-Fi hotspot for data access and navigation during your stay.\n- Always wear a helmet when riding a scooter or bike, and follow local traffic rules to ensure your safety.\n- Don't drink and drive, as **drunk driving laws** are strictly enforced in Curacao.",
