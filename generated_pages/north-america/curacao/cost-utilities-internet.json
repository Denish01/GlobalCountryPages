  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Curacao can vary depending on factors such as location, usage, and provider, but a rough estimate for a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment is around $250-$350 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($275 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($75 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($30 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.35 per kWh)\nCurrency: ANG\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Curacao is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on various factors such as global market trends and seasonal demand. For example, during the peak tourist season (December to April), the demand for electricity and water tends to increase, which can lead to higher costs. Additionally, the inflation rate in Curacao, which was 2.6% in 2019, can also impact the cost of utilities.\n\nThe quality of the utility infrastructure in Curacao is generally good, with a high level of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there may be some variations in the quality of service depending on the location, with some areas experiencing more frequent power outages or water supply disruptions. Overall, the cost of utilities in Curacao is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, but this is largely due to the island's remote location and reliance on imported fuel.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | based on 300-500 kWh/month |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | based on 10-20 cubic meters/month |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | not commonly used in Curacao |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in property tax |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10-20 Mbps | UTS, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-120 | 50-100 Mbps | UTS, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-30 | 1-10 GB | UTS, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-60 | 10-20 GB | UTS, Digicel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | UTS, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in Curacao |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Curacao |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | not widely available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Curacao, it's best to contact the providers directly, such as UTS for electricity and water, and Digicel for internet and phone services.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but they may not be the most cost-effective option for heavy users.\n- The best internet providers in Curacao are UTS and Digicel, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it's a good idea to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of any available discounts or promotions.\n- It's also a good idea to monitor your usage and adjust your plans accordingly to avoid unexpected costs.",
