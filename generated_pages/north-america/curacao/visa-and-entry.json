[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nCuracao has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visa applications for different nationalities. Citizens of around 60 countries can enter Curacao without a visa, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain one upon arrival. The visa-free access is mainly granted to citizens of European countries, as well as some countries in the Americas and Asia.\n\nThe government of Curacao aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel to the island, while also maintaining strict controls to ensure the security and integrity of its borders. As a result, the visa policy is subject to change, and it is essential to check the latest requirements before planning a trip to Curacao.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can enter with a valid passport or ID card |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for a visa in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for a visa in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Curacao for up to 30 days, and may need to provide proof of onward travel, sufficient funds, and health insurance.
