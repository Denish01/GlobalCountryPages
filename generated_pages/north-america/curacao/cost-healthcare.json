Public healthcare services are generally more affordable, but often have longer wait times and may not offer the same level of personalized care as private services. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary choice, while foreigners may prefer to use private services. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and patient fees, while private services are typically paid for out-of-pocket or through private insurance.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Curacao is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. However, the public healthcare system can be overcrowded and underfunded, which can lead to longer wait times and a lower level of care. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, offer more personalized care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the cost of medical care, as the cost of private services can be high.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, advanced procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at a pharmacy with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor, with costs ranging from $10-$50 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with costs ranging from $5-$20 per item\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics are generally affordable, with costs ranging from $5-$20 per prescription\n- Pharmacy hours are typically Monday to Friday, 8am-6pm, and Saturday, 8am-1pm\n- Some pharmacies may offer 24-hour emergency services, with higher costs for after-hours services\n- It is recommended to have a valid prescription and identification when purchasing medication\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 912 or visit the **St. Elisabeth Hospital**, which is the main public hospital in Curacao.
