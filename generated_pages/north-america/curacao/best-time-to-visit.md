Curacao is a tropical island located in the southern Caribbean, outside the hurricane belt, but still experiences a dry and wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity, plenty of sunshine, and gentle trade winds.

The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by higher humidity, occasional rainfall, and increased risk of hurricanes. Although the weather can be less predictable during this time, the island's **beaches** and **coves** are still accessible, and the lush vegetation is a sight to behold.

The seasons in Curacao have a significant impact on travel, as the dry season is the peak tourist season, with higher prices and larger crowds. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with lower prices and fewer tourists. However, the wet season is also the best time to see the island's unique **wildlife**, such as the **Curacao white-tailed deer**, as the vegetation is lush and green. The seasons also affect the **festivals** and **events** on the island, with many taking place during the dry season.

The climate in Curacao is also influenced by its location in the southern Caribbean, which means that the island experiences a relatively constant temperature throughout the year. The average temperature ranges from 78°F to 88°F (25°C to 31°C), making it an ideal destination for **beach lovers** and **water sports enthusiasts**.
