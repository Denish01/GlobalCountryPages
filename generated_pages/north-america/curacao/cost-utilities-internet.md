[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Curacao is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on various factors such as global market trends and seasonal demand. For example, during the peak tourist season (December to April), the demand for electricity and water tends to increase, which can lead to higher costs. Additionally, the inflation rate in Curacao, which was 2.6% in 2019, can also impact the cost of utilities.

The quality of the utility infrastructure in Curacao is generally good, with a high level of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there may be some variations in the quality of service depending on the location, with some areas experiencing more frequent power outages or water supply disruptions. Overall, the cost of utilities in Curacao is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, but this is largely due to the island's remote location and reliance on imported fuel.
