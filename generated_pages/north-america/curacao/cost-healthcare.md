[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Curacao is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare services are generally more affordable, but often have longer wait times and may not offer the same level of personalized care as private services. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary choice, while foreigners may prefer to use private services. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and patient fees, while private services are typically paid for out-of-pocket or through private insurance.

The quality of healthcare in Curacao is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. However, the public healthcare system can be overcrowded and underfunded, which can lead to longer wait times and a lower level of care. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, offer more personalized care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover the cost of medical care, as the cost of private services can be high.
