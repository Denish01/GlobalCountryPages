[SECTION] How Curacao Is Divided [/SECTION]
Curacao is a territory of the Netherlands, located in the southern Caribbean, and its administrative structure is relatively simple, with no states or provinces. The island is divided into several neighborhoods or districts for local administration purposes, but these do not have the same level of autonomy as states or provinces in other countries. The capital city of Willemstad serves as the economic and cultural hub of the island, and is home to many of the island's government offices, businesses, and cultural institutions. The island's small size and relatively simple administrative structure make it easy to navigate and get around.

The lack of administrative divisions in Curacao also reflects the island's history as a Dutch colony, where the central government in Willemstad has traditionally played a strong role in governing the island. Today, the island has a significant degree of autonomy, but the Dutch government still maintains some responsibility for defense and foreign affairs. This unique arrangement has helped to shape the island's culture and identity, with a blend of Dutch, African, and indigenous influences.
