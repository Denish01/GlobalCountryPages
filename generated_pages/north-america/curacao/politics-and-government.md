[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Curacao is based on the principles of **democracy** and **representation**, where the people elect their representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The **separation of powers** is a key feature of the system, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **unitary** structure of the government means that power is concentrated in the central government, with limited autonomy for local authorities. The **parliamentary system** allows for a prime minister to be appointed as the head of government, who is responsible for advising the king and overseeing the administration of the country.

The government of Curacao is also subject to the **Kingdom of the Netherlands**, with the king serving as the head of state. However, the king's role is largely ceremonial, with most executive powers being exercised by the prime minister and the **Council of Ministers**. The **Staten van Curaçao**, the unicameral legislature, is composed of 21 members who are elected by **proportional representation** for a term of four years.

The political system in Curacao is designed to promote **stability** and **accountability**, with a system of **checks and balances** to prevent any one branch of government from abusing its power. The **independence of the judiciary** is also a key feature of the system, with the **Common Court of Justice** and the **Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba** responsible for interpreting the law and resolving disputes.
