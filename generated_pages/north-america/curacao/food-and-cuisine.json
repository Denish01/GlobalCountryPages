For example, **Erwtensoep** (pea soup) is a popular Dutch dish that has been modified to include Caribbean spices and ingredients. Additionally, the influence of African and Latin American cuisine can be seen in the use of ingredients like coconut milk, chili peppers, and plantains.\n\nCuracao's food culture is also shaped by its cultural events and festivals, such as the **Curacao Food Festival**, which showcases the island's culinary diversity and creativity.
