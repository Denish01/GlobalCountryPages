[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a wide range of medical services available to its residents and visitors. The public healthcare system is funded by the government and provides access to healthcare services for all citizens, regardless of income level. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers a wider range of specialized services and is often preferred by those who can afford it. The quality of care in Puerto Rico is generally high, with many hospitals and medical facilities meeting or exceeding international standards. However, access to healthcare services can be limited in rural areas, where there may be fewer medical facilities and specialists available.

The public healthcare system in Puerto Rico is administered by the **Department of Health**, which oversees a network of hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. These facilities provide a range of medical services, including primary care, specialty care, and emergency services. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, is comprised of private hospitals, clinics, and medical offices, which offer a wide range of specialized services, including **cardiology**, **oncology**, and **orthopedic surgery**.

In terms of access to healthcare services, urban areas such as San Juan tend to have more medical facilities and specialists available than rural areas. However, the government has implemented initiatives to improve access to healthcare services in rural areas, including the establishment of community health centers and the deployment of mobile health units.
