[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Puerto Rico has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including the territory's unique tax incentives, its status as a US territory, and its natural beauty. The market is characterized by a mix of urban and rural areas, with San Juan being the main hub for commercial and residential activity. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from luxury apartments in San Juan to beachfront villas in Rincón. The price trajectory has been steadily increasing, with some areas experiencing higher growth rates than others. Urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, but the latter offer a more relaxed pace of life and often stunning natural scenery.

The market trends in Puerto Rico are influenced by the territory's economy, which has been growing steadily in recent years. The tourism sector is a significant contributor to the economy, and the property market has benefited from the increased demand for short-term rentals and vacation homes. The **Act 20/22** tax incentive program has also attracted many foreign investors, who are drawn to the territory's favorable tax regime and business-friendly environment. However, the market is not without its challenges, and buyers should be aware of the potential risks, including the impact of natural disasters such as hurricanes.

In terms of price, the market in Puerto Rico is relatively affordable compared to other destinations in the Caribbean. The average price per square meter in San Juan is around $2,500 USD, although prices can vary significantly depending on the location, type of property, and amenities. Rentals are also available, with the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Juan being around $800 USD. The rental yield is approximately 4%, which is relatively low compared to other investment opportunities, but the territory's tax incentives and relatively low property prices make it an attractive option for investors.
