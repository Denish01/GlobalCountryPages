Citizens of these countries can enter Puerto Rico without a visa and stay for up to 90 days for tourism or business purposes. However, citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access will need to obtain a visa from the US embassy or consulate in their home country before traveling to Puerto Rico.\n\nThe visa policy of Puerto Rico is aligned with the US visa policy, and the requirements for entry are the same as those for entering the US. This means that visitors will need to meet the same requirements, including having a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | N/A | N/A | As a US territory, US citizens can enter Puerto Rico with a valid government-issued ID |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Visa Waiver Program (VWP) eligible |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | VWP eligible, except for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | VWP eligible |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | VWP eligible |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Non-Immigrant Visa | varies | Must apply for a US visa at a US embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Non-Immigrant Visa | varies | Must apply for a US visa at a US embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Puerto Rico without a visa if they are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) or have a valid US visa.
