  "content": "As a territory of the United States, Puerto Rico's visa requirements are generally the same as those for the United States, and citizens of many countries do not need a visa to visit Puerto Rico for tourism or business stays up to 90 days. \n\n[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Puerto Rico before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter visa-free for tourism and business purposes. Citizens of countries that are part of the US Visa Waiver Program (VWP) can enter Puerto Rico without a visa for stays up to 90 days. The VWP includes countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, and many European countries. However, travelers must meet certain requirements, such as having a valid Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) approval prior to their flight to Puerto Rico.\n\nThe visa policy for Puerto Rico is designed to balance national security concerns with the need to facilitate international travel and tourism. The US government has implemented various programs and initiatives to streamline the visa application process and reduce wait times for travelers. For example, the US Department of State offers an online visa application system, and many US embassies and consulates offer expedited processing options for an additional fee.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | N/A | Unlimited | US citizens do not need a passport to enter Puerto Rico, but they must provide proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or state-issued ID |\n| UK Citizens | No | ESTA | 90 days | UK citizens can enter Puerto Rico under the VWP, but must obtain an ESTA approval prior to their flight |\n| EU Citizens | No | ESTA | 90 days | EU citizens can enter Puerto Rico under the VWP, but must obtain an ESTA approval prior to their flight |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | N/A | 183 days | Canadian citizens do not need a visa or ESTA to enter Puerto Rico, but must provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate |\n| Australian Citizens | No | ESTA | 90 days | Australian citizens can enter Puerto Rico under the VWP, but must obtain an ESTA approval prior to their flight |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30-60 days | Indian citizens must apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate prior to their trip to Puerto Rico |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30-60 days | Chinese citizens must apply for a non-immigrant visa at a US embassy or consulate prior to their trip to Puerto Rico |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** To enter Puerto Rico as a tourist, travelers must have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds for their stay.
