This decline is largely due to a combination of factors, including a low fertility rate, an aging population, and significant out-migration to the United States mainland. The island's population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with over 93% of residents living in urban areas. The capital city, San Juan, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 342,000 people. Despite these trends, Puerto Rico remains a culturally vibrant and diverse society, with a strong sense of identity and community.\n\nThe island's population has been shaped by its complex history, including centuries of Spanish colonial rule, African slavery, and immigration from other parts of the world. Today, Puerto Rico is a melting pot of different cultures, with a unique blend of Spanish, African, and American influences. The population is also highly educated, with a literacy rate of over 90% and a strong emphasis on education and healthcare.\n\nPuerto Rico's population trends have significant implications for the island's economy, politics, and social services. The declining population and aging workforce pose challenges for the island's labor market and pension system, while the high level of urbanization puts pressure on infrastructure and public services.
