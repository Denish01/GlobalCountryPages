However, there is a significant urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable connections available in cities like San Juan, and slower speeds in rural areas. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by the weather, with hurricanes and tropical storms occasionally causing outages and disruptions.\n\nIn terms of internet infrastructure, Puerto Rico has a well-developed network of undersea cables and fiber-optic connections, which provide fast and reliable links to the US mainland and other parts of the world. This has made it an attractive location for data centers and other internet-based businesses. However, the island's geography, with its mountainous terrain and rugged coastline, can make it difficult to provide internet access to some remote areas.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Puerto Rico, you can visit a store or kiosk of one of the main carriers, such as Claro, T-Mobile, or AT&T.
