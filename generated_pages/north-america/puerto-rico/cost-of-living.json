[/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico is a US territory in the northeastern Caribbean, offering a unique blend of Spanish and American cultures. The cost of living in Puerto Rico is relatively moderate compared to other Caribbean islands and US states. The prices of goods and services are generally lower than in the US mainland, but higher than in some neighboring islands like the Dominican Republic. The cost of living in Puerto Rico can vary greatly depending on the location, with San Juan being the most expensive city. Overall, Puerto Rico offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for tourists, expats, and digital nomads.\n\nThe cost of living in Puerto Rico is also influenced by its status as a US territory, which means that many American brands and products are widely available, but often at a higher price than in the US mainland. Additionally, the island's economy has been affected by natural disasters like Hurricane Maria, which has led to an increase in prices for certain goods and services. However, the local government has been working to revitalize the economy and attract new businesses, which is expected to have a positive impact on the cost of living in the long term.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $20-40 | Basic dorms and guesthouses, often with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $80-150 | Comfortable hotels with private bathrooms and amenities like pools and restaurants |\n| Luxury/Resort | $200-500 | High-end hotels and resorts with luxurious amenities and services |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $400-1,200 | City center apartments tend to be more expensive, while those outside the city center can be more affordable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-70 |\n| Fine Dining | $80-150 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $2-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-5 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.75-1.50 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-5 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-300 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80-1.20 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 400 | 800 | 1,500 |\n| Food | 300 | 600 | 1,000 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **1,100** | **2,200** | **3,700** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in apartments or guesthouses outside of San Juan to save on accommodation costs.\n- Eat at local eateries and food trucks to enjoy traditional Puerto Rican cuisine at affordable prices.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce transport costs.\n- Take advantage of free attractions like beaches, parks, and historic sites to save on entertainment costs.\n- Shop at local markets or grocery stores to buy fresh produce and other essentials at lower prices.\n- Look for package deals or discounts on activities and tours to make the most of your budget.",
