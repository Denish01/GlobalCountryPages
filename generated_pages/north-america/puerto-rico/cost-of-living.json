[/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico is a US territory in the northeastern Caribbean, and its cost of living reflects its connection to the United States. The prices of goods and services are generally higher than in other Caribbean islands, but lower than in many major US cities. Compared to its neighbors, the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico tends to be more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food. However, the island's unique cultural heritage, beautiful beaches, and modern infrastructure make it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike.\n\nThe cost of living in Puerto Rico can vary greatly depending on the location, with San Juan being the most expensive city on the island. The capital city offers a wide range of amenities, including high-end restaurants, bars, and shopping centers, which can drive up the cost of living. However, outside of San Juan, the cost of living can be significantly lower, making Puerto Rico a more affordable option for those who prefer a more laid-back lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-60 | Shared rooms and basic amenities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $100-200 | Private rooms, pool, and free breakfast |\n| Luxury/Resort | $250-500 | High-end amenities, private beach, and gourmet dining |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $600-1,200 | City center, 1-bedroom apartment |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $400-900 | Outside city center, 1-bedroom apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-70 |\n| Fine Dining | $80-150 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $2-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.75-1.50 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-5 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80-1.20 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 600 | 1,000 | 1,800 |\n| Food | 300 | 600 | 1,000 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **1,300** | **2,400** | **4,000** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in a hostel or guesthouse instead of a hotel to save on accommodation costs.\n- Eat at local eateries or food trucks to enjoy traditional Puerto Rican cuisine at a lower price.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce transport costs.\n- Take advantage of free attractions and activities, such as visiting the beach or exploring Old San Juan.\n- Shop at local markets or grocery stores to buy fresh produce and other essentials at a lower price.\n- Look for package deals or discounts on activities and tours to save on entertainment costs.\n\n[CALLOUT] Be sure to research and book accommodations and tours in advance to avoid peak season prices and availability issues.
