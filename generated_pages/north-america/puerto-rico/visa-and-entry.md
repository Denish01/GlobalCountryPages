# Puerto Rico Visa & Entry Requirements

As a territory of the United States, Puerto Rico follows the US visa policy, and citizens of countries that do not require a visa to enter the US do not need a visa to enter Puerto Rico. 

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Puerto Rico before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico has a moderate visa stance, with citizens of over 40 countries eligible for visa-free access, including most European countries, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Citizens of these countries can enter Puerto Rico without a visa and stay for up to 90 days for tourism or business purposes. However, citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access will need to obtain a visa from the US embassy or consulate in their home country before traveling to Puerto Rico.

The visa policy of Puerto Rico is aligned with the US visa policy, and the requirements for entry are the same as those for entering the US. This means that visitors will need to meet the same requirements, including having a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay.
