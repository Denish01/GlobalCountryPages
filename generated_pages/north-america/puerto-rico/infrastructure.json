  "content": "The infrastructure in Puerto Rico is well-developed, with a comprehensive network of roads, a reliable power grid, and modern telecommunications systems, but the territory still faces challenges in terms of rural access and resilience to natural disasters.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 80%\nRoad Network: 26,000 km, well-maintained\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 5\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico has a high level of infrastructure development, with significant investments in recent years to improve its roads, energy systems, and telecommunications networks. The territory's urban areas, such as San Juan, have modern amenities and services, while rural areas still face challenges in terms of access to reliable electricity, clean water, and high-speed internet. The government has been working to address these disparities and improve the overall resilience of the infrastructure, particularly in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government has launched several initiatives to upgrade the territory's infrastructure, including a major road reconstruction program and investments in renewable energy. These efforts aim to enhance the territory's competitiveness, improve the quality of life for residents, and reduce its vulnerability to natural disasters. Despite these progress, challenges persist, particularly in terms of funding and maintenance, which can impact the reliability and efficiency of the infrastructure.\n\nPuerto Rico's infrastructure development is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, as the territory relies on federal funding and support for many of its infrastructure projects. This has led to a mix of modern and aging infrastructure, with some areas boasting state-of-the-art facilities while others struggle with outdated systems.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 26,000 km | Good | Well-maintained, with some traffic congestion in urban areas |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network, but plans for a potential high-speed rail link |\n| Airports | 3 international, 2 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, with some limitations in terms of capacity |\n| Ports | 5 major | Good | Well-equipped, with some plans for expansion and modernization |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Puerto Rico's power generation is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a growing share of **renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power.\n- The territory has made significant progress in increasing its **energy efficiency**, with a focus on reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of energy-efficient technologies.\n- Despite these efforts, **power outages** remain a challenge, particularly in rural areas, where the grid is more vulnerable to disruptions.\n- Puerto Rico has set ambitious targets for **renewable energy**, aiming to generate 40% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.\n- The territory is also exploring **energy storage** solutions, such as batteries, to improve the stability and reliability of its power grid.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Puerto Rico's **tap water** is generally safe to drink, with modern treatment plants and distribution systems in place.\n- However, some areas, particularly in rural communities, still struggle with **water access** and **sanitation** issues, with a higher risk of waterborne diseases.\n- The territory has made significant progress in improving its **wastewater treatment** capabilities, with a focus on reducing pollution and protecting the environment.\n- Puerto Rico is also investing in **water conservation** measures, such as water-efficient appliances and rainwater harvesting systems.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **rural water access**, including the construction of new water treatment plants and distribution systems.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Puerto Rico has a **high level of mobile penetration**, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phones.\n- The territory has made significant progress in **broadband deployment**, with a focus on expanding fiber-optic networks and improving internet speeds.\n- **4G and 5G networks** are widely available, with multiple providers offering high-speed mobile internet services.\n- Puerto Rico is also investing in **telecommunications infrastructure**, including the development of data centers and cloud computing services.\n- The territory has a **well-developed postal system**, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services across the island.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Puerto Rican government has launched a **major road reconstruction program**, aiming to upgrade and expand the territory's road network.\n- The territory is also investing in **renewable energy projects**, including solar and wind farms, to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.\n- A **new airport terminal** is under construction in San Juan, aiming to improve the territory's air transportation infrastructure.\n- Puerto Rico is exploring **public-private partnerships** to fund and develop major infrastructure projects, such as ports and energy facilities.\n- The territory has received significant funding from the US government to support **disaster recovery and resilience** efforts, including infrastructure upgrades and repairs.",
