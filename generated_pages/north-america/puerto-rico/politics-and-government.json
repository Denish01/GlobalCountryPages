The system is designed to provide a balance of power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and limitations. The **separation of powers** is intended to prevent any one branch from dominating the others and to ensure that power is distributed evenly. The government of Puerto Rico is also subject to the authority of the federal government, which has jurisdiction over matters such as foreign policy, national defense, and interstate commerce.\n\nThe **executive branch** is headed by the Governor of Puerto Rico, who is elected by the people for a four-year term. The Governor is responsible for executing the laws and overseeing the various executive departments and agencies. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Legislative Assembly, a bicameral body consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Legislative Assembly is responsible for making the laws of Puerto Rico, subject to the approval of the Governor. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and the lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the laws and resolving disputes.\n\nThe **federal system** of government in Puerto Rico is distinct from the **unitary system** found in some other countries, in which the central government has complete control over all aspects of governance. In a federal system, power is divided between the central government and the constituent units, such as states or territories. This division of power allows for greater autonomy and flexibility at the local level, while also providing a framework for national coordination and cooperation.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the Governor | Governor Pedro Pierluisi | Executes laws, oversees executive departments |\n| Legislative | Legislative Assembly | President of the Senate and Speaker of the House | Makes laws, approves budgets |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Puerto Rico | Chief Justice Maite Oronoz Rodríguez | Interprets laws, resolves disputes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New Progressive Party (PNP) | Center-right | Pedro Pierluisi | 21 (Senate), 34 (House) | Supports statehood |\n| Popular Democratic Party (PPD) | Center-left | Aníbal José Torres | 13 (Senate), 24 (House) | Supports commonwealth status |\n| Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) | Left | Juan Dalmau Ramírez | 1 (Senate), 1 (House) | Supports independence |\n| Citizen Victory Movement (MVC) | Center | Manuel Natal Albelo | 2 (Senate), 2 (House) | Supports self-determination |\n| Project Dignity (PD) | Right | César Vázquez Muñiz | 1 (Senate), 1 (House) | Supports conservative values |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Puerto Rico is based on **universal suffrage**, with all citizens aged 18 and over eligible to vote.\n- Elections are held every four years to elect the Governor, members of the Legislative Assembly, and other officials.\n- The most recent election was held in 2020, in which Pedro Pierluisi was elected Governor.\n- The next election is scheduled for 2024, with voter participation expected to be high due to ongoing debates over the island's **status** and **economic development**.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Puerto Rico is marked by **polarization** and **partisanship**, with debates over the island's status and economic development dominating the agenda.\n- Key issues include **debt restructuring**, **fiscal reform**, and **disaster recovery** efforts following Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n- Regional dynamics, including relations with the United States and other Caribbean countries, also play a significant role in shaping Puerto Rico's political landscape.\n- Freedom indices, such as the **Freedom in the World** report, have noted concerns over **corruption** and **transparency** in government, as well as **limits on civil liberties**.\n- The **citizen participation** and **civil society** are increasingly active in promoting **good governance** and **accountability** in Puerto Rico.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Puerto Rico's foreign relations are managed by the **United States Department of State**, which represents the island's interests abroad.\n- The island is a member of several **international organizations**, including the **United Nations** and the **Organization of American States**.\n- Puerto Rico has **diplomatic relations** with several countries, including the **Dominican Republic** and **Cuba**, and participates in regional forums such as the **Association of Caribbean States**.\n- The island's **economic development** strategy includes **trade agreements** with other countries, such as the **United States** and **Canada**.\n- Puerto Rico's **foreign policy** is shaped by its **relationship with the United States**, which provides the island with **defense** and **security** guarantees.",
