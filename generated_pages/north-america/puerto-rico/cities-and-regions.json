Instead, it is divided into 78 municipalities, each with its own local government and administration. These municipalities are further grouped into eight senatorial districts, which are used for electoral purposes. The island is also divided into several regions, each with its own unique character and attractions. From the bustling metropolitan area of San Juan to the scenic coastal towns of the north and the rugged mountains of the central region, Puerto Rico's diverse geography and culture are reflected in its administrative divisions.\n\nThe administrative structure of Puerto Rico is designed to provide a high level of local autonomy, with each municipality having its own mayor and municipal assembly. This allows for a more responsive and effective government, as local officials are better equipped to address the specific needs and concerns of their communities.
