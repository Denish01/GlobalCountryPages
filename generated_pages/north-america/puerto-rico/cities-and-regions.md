[SECTION] How Puerto Rico Is Divided [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, located in the northeastern Caribbean, and is divided into 78 municipalities, each with its own government and administrative structure. The municipalities are further grouped into eight senatorial districts, which are used for electoral purposes. The island's administrative structure is a combination of the municipal and federal systems, with the governor and legislature having significant powers in managing the territory's affairs.

The division of Puerto Rico into municipalities and senatorial districts allows for a decentralized approach to governance, enabling local communities to address their unique needs and challenges. This structure also facilitates the implementation of regional development initiatives, which aim to promote economic growth, improve infrastructure, and enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors alike. For instance, the municipality of San Juan has implemented various urban renewal projects, while the municipality of Ponce has focused on developing its tourism infrastructure.
