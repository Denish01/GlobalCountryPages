[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Puerto Rico operates under the **United States Constitution** and the **Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act**, which established the island's current territorial status. The system is designed to provide a balance of power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and limitations. The **separation of powers** is intended to prevent any one branch from dominating the others and to ensure that power is distributed evenly. The government of Puerto Rico is also subject to the authority of the federal government, which has jurisdiction over matters such as foreign policy, national defense, and interstate commerce.

The **executive branch** is headed by the Governor of Puerto Rico, who is elected by the people for a four-year term. The Governor is responsible for executing the laws and overseeing the various executive departments and agencies. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Legislative Assembly, a bicameral body consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Legislative Assembly is responsible for making the laws of Puerto Rico, subject to the approval of the Governor. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and the lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the laws and resolving disputes.

The **federal system** of government in Puerto Rico is distinct from the **unitary system** found in some other countries, in which the central government has complete control over all aspects of governance. In a federal system, power is divided between the central government and the constituent units, such as states or territories. This division of power allows for greater autonomy and flexibility at the local level, while also providing a framework for national coordination and cooperation.
