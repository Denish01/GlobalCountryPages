[SECTION] How Expensive Is Puerto Rico? [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico is a US territory in the northeastern Caribbean, and its cost of living reflects its connection to the United States. The prices of goods and services are generally higher than in other Caribbean islands, but lower than in many major US cities. Compared to its neighbors, the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico tends to be more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food. However, the island's unique cultural heritage, beautiful beaches, and modern infrastructure make it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike.

The cost of living in Puerto Rico can vary greatly depending on the location, with San Juan being the most expensive city on the island. The capital city offers a wide range of amenities, including high-end restaurants, bars, and shopping centers, which can drive up the cost of living. However, outside of San Juan, the cost of living can be significantly lower, making Puerto Rico a more affordable option for those who prefer a more laid-back lifestyle.
