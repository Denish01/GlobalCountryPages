[SECTION] How Expensive Is Puerto Rico? [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico is a US territory in the northeastern Caribbean, offering a unique blend of Spanish and American cultures. The cost of living in Puerto Rico is relatively moderate compared to other Caribbean islands and US states. The prices of goods and services are generally lower than in the US mainland, but higher than in some neighboring islands like the Dominican Republic. The cost of living in Puerto Rico can vary greatly depending on the location, with San Juan being the most expensive city. Overall, Puerto Rico offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for tourists, expats, and digital nomads.

The cost of living in Puerto Rico is also influenced by its status as a US territory, which means that many American brands and products are widely available, but often at a higher price than in the US mainland. Additionally, the island's economy has been affected by natural disasters like Hurricane Maria, which has led to an increase in prices for certain goods and services. However, the local government has been working to revitalize the economy and attract new businesses, which is expected to have a positive impact on the cost of living in the long term.
