[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico has a high-income economy, with a GDP per capita of over $32,000, which is one of the highest in the Americas. The island's economy is classified as a high-income economy by the World Bank, and it has a relatively high standard of living compared to other countries in the region. However, the economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a debt crisis, hurricanes, and economic stagnation. The island's economy is also heavily dependent on the United States, with the US being its main trading partner and source of investment. Puerto Rico's economic development level is relatively advanced, with a strong focus on export-oriented manufacturing and services.

The island's economy has a long history of industrialization, dating back to the 1950s, when the US government invested heavily in the island's infrastructure and industry. This led to a period of rapid economic growth, known as the "Puerto Rican miracle," which transformed the island into one of the most industrialized and prosperous economies in the region. However, in recent years, the economy has faced significant challenges, including a decline in the manufacturing sector, a rise in debt, and a series of devastating hurricanes that have damaged the island's infrastructure and economy.

Despite these challenges, Puerto Rico's economy remains one of the most advanced and diversified in the region, with a strong focus on high-tech industries, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The island is also home to a number of major corporations, including pharmaceutical companies, financial institutions, and technology firms. The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting economic development, including tax incentives, investment in infrastructure, and support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
