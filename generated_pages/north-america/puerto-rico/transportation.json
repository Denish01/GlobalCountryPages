  "content": "To get around in Puerto Rico, you can use a combination of taxis, buses, and rental cars, as well as explore the island's scenic roads and highways on your own or with a guided tour.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: Uber\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico is easily accessible by air, with the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU) in San Juan being the main entry point for most visitors. This airport receives direct flights from major US cities such as New York, Miami, and Chicago, as well as from other Caribbean islands. If you're coming from further afield, you may need to connect through a US city or another Caribbean hub. There are no overland entry points to Puerto Rico, as it is an island territory, but you can also arrive by sea on a cruise ship or a private boat.\n\nThe airport is located about 15 minutes from San Juan's city center, and you can get there by taxi, Uber, or rental car. Alternatively, you can take a shuttle or bus service from the airport to your destination. If you're driving from the airport, you can take the PR-26 highway, which connects the airport to the city center. There are also several car rental companies with desks at the airport, including major brands like Hertz and Avis.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico has a limited domestic air network, with most flights operating between San Juan and smaller airports on the island. The main domestic airline is Cape Air, which offers flights to destinations such as Vieques, Culebra, and Mayagüez. You can book flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the time of year and how far in advance you book. A one-way ticket from San Juan to Vieques, for example, can cost around $100-$200. It's worth noting that flights can be weather-dependent, so it's a good idea to check the forecast before you travel.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico has no rail network, so you won't be able to travel by train on the island. However, there are plans to develop a light rail system in San Juan, which would connect the city center to the airport and other major destinations. For now, you'll need to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico has a comprehensive network of buses and coaches that connect major towns and cities on the island. The main bus company is Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses (AMA), which operates services in and around San Juan, as well as to other destinations on the island. You can pay your fare in cash when you board the bus, and prices are generally very reasonable, with a one-way ticket costing around $1-$5. There are also several private bus companies that operate on the island, including tourist-oriented services that offer guided tours and transportation to popular attractions.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | San Juan | $1.50 | Limited routes, but convenient for getting around the city center |\n| City Bus | San Juan, Ponce, Mayagüez | $1-$3 | Comprehensive network of buses, but can be slow due to traffic |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $10-$20 | Metered fares, but can be more expensive than other options |\n| Ride-Hailing | San Juan, Ponce | $10-$20 | Uber is widely available, but prices can surge during peak hours |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Not available | - | Not a common mode of transport in Puerto Rico |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Puerto Rico, you'll need a valid US driver's license, as the island is a US territory.\n- The road quality in Puerto Rico is generally good, with well-maintained highways and scenic roads.\n- Fuel costs are similar to those in the US, with gas prices averaging around $2.50 per gallon.\n- Car rental companies are widely available, including major brands like Hertz and Avis, and prices start from around $40 per day.\n- When driving in Puerto Rico, be aware of the potential for traffic congestion, especially in San Juan, and watch out for potholes and other road hazards.\n- It's also a good idea to rent a car with a GPS system, as some roads on the island can be narrow and winding, and it's easy to get lost.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- **Be prepared for traffic**: San Juan is a busy city, and traffic can be heavy, especially during rush hour.\n- **Use reputable taxi companies**: Always use a licensed taxi service, and make sure the meter is turned on at the start of your journey.\n- **Download the Uber app**: Uber is widely available in Puerto Rico, and can be a convenient way to get around, especially in San Juan.\n- **Bring a map or GPS**: Puerto Rico's roads can be narrow and winding, and it's easy to get lost, so make sure you have a map or GPS system to help you navigate.\n- **Be aware of road hazards**: Puerto Rico's roads can be prone to potholes and other hazards, especially after heavy rain, so drive carefully and watch out for obstacles.\n- **Respect local drivers**: Puerto Rican drivers can be aggressive, so be patient and respectful, and avoid confrontations on the road.\n- **Use cash**: Not all businesses in Puerto Rico accept credit or debit cards, so it's a good idea to have some cash on hand, especially when using public transportation or taxis.\n- **Learn some Spanish**: While many Puerto Ricans speak English, it's still a good idea to learn some basic Spanish phrases, such as \"gracias\" (thank you) and \"¿dónde está...?\" (where is...?), to help you navigate the island.",
