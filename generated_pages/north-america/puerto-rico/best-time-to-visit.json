[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nPuerto Rico has a tropical climate, with temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C) throughout the year. The island is divided into three main climate zones: the coastal areas, which are generally hot and humid; the mountains, which are cooler and more temperate; and the rainforests, which are warm and humid. The dry season, from December to April, is characterized by low humidity and plenty of sunshine, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, from May to November, is marked by higher humidity and more frequent rainfall, with the most significant risk of hurricanes and tropical storms in September and October.\n\nThe seasons in Puerto Rico have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, the weather is perfect for outdoor activities such as hiking, surfing, and exploring the island's beautiful beaches. The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, with frequent rainfall and higher humidity making it difficult to enjoy the island's outdoor attractions.\n\nHowever, the wet season also has its advantages, with lower prices and fewer crowds making it an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers.
