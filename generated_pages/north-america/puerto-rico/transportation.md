[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico is easily accessible by air, with the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU) in San Juan being the main entry point for most visitors. This airport receives direct flights from major US cities such as New York, Miami, and Chicago, as well as from other Caribbean islands. If you're coming from further afield, you may need to connect through a US city or another Caribbean hub. There are no overland entry points to Puerto Rico, as it is an island territory, but you can also arrive by sea on a cruise ship or a private boat.

The airport is located about 15 minutes from San Juan's city center, and you can get there by taxi, Uber, or rental car. Alternatively, you can take a shuttle or bus service from the airport to your destination. If you're driving from the airport, you can take the PR-26 highway, which connects the airport to the city center. There are also several car rental companies with desks at the airport, including major brands like Hertz and Avis.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico has a limited domestic air network, with most flights operating between San Juan and smaller airports on the island. The main domestic airline is Cape Air, which offers flights to destinations such as Vieques, Culebra, and Mayagüez. You can book flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the time of year and how far in advance you book. A one-way ticket from San Juan to Vieques, for example, can cost around $100-$200. It's worth noting that flights can be weather-dependent, so it's a good idea to check the forecast before you travel.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico has no rail network, so you won't be able to travel by train on the island. However, there are plans to develop a light rail system in San Juan, which would connect the city center to the airport and other major destinations. For now, you'll need to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico has a comprehensive network of buses and coaches that connect major towns and cities on the island. The main bus company is Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses (AMA), which operates services in and around San Juan, as well as to other destinations on the island. You can pay your fare in cash when you board the bus, and prices are generally very reasonable, with a one-way ticket costing around $1-$5. There are also several private bus companies that operate on the island, including tourist-oriented services that offer guided tours and transportation to popular attractions.
