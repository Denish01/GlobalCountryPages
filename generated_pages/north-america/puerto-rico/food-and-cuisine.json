The island's strategic location in the Caribbean has made it a melting pot of flavors, with African slaves bringing their own culinary traditions, and Spanish colonizers introducing their own ingredients and cooking techniques. The result is a unique and flavorful cuisine that is both familiar and exotic. Regional variations exist, with the north coast known for its seafood, the central mountains for its traditional dishes, and the south coast for its African-influenced cuisine.\n\nThe cuisine is also heavily influenced by the island's history, with many dishes reflecting the struggles and hardships of the Puerto Rican people. For example, **Sancocho**, a hearty stew, was originally made with scraps of meat and vegetables, and has become a staple of Puerto Rican cuisine. The island's cuisine is also known for its use of **sofrito**, a mixture of garlic, onions, and bell peppers that is used to flavor many dishes.\n\nPuerto Rican cuisine is not just about the food, but also about the culture and traditions surrounding it. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring family and friends together, and the island is known for its vibrant festivals and celebrations, which often center around food. From the **Fiestas de la Cruz** in May to the **Festival de la Calle San Sebastián** in January, there is always something to celebrate in Puerto Rico, and the food is always at the center of the celebration.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arroz con Gandules | Main Course | Hearty rice dish with pigeon peas | La Estación, San Juan |\n| Mofongo | Side Dish | Mashed plantains filled with meat or seafood | La Bombonera, San Juan |\n| Empanadas | Snack | Meat or cheese-filled pastry | La Placita de Santurce, San Juan |\n| Alcapurrias | Snack | Meat or cheese-filled fritters | Luquillo Kiosks, Luquillo |\n| Churrasco | Main Course | Grilled skirt steak with garlic and herbs | La Parroquia, San Juan |\n| Bacalao | Main Course | Codfish stew with vegetables and root vegetables | La Casa de los Abuelos, Ponce |\n| Tostones | Side Dish | Fried or baked green plantains | La Tostonería, San Juan |\n| Quesito | Dessert | Cream-filled pastry | La Quesitería, San Juan |\n| Flan | Dessert | Creamy custard dessert | La Casa de los Postres, San Juan |\n| Tembleque | Dessert | Coconut pudding dessert | La Temblequería, Ponce |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Alcapurrias**: meat or cheese-filled fritters, $3-5\n- **Empanadas**: meat or cheese-filled pastry, $2-4\n- **Tostones**: fried or baked green plantains, $2-3\n- **Arroz con gandules**: hearty rice dish with pigeon peas, $5-7\n- **Sorullos**: corn fritters, $2-3\n- **Cocas**: coconut cookies, $1-2\n- **Mallorca**: sweet bread, $1-2\n- **Piononos**: sweet plantain fritters, $2-3\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Pina Colada**: creamy pineapple cocktail, $5-7\n- **Mojito**: refreshing mint cocktail, $5-7\n- **Medalla Light**: local beer, $3-5\n- **Fresh Coconut Water**: refreshing and hydrating, $2-3\n- **Coffee**: strong and rich, $1-2\n- **Fresh Fruit Juices**: orange, mango, and pineapple, $2-3\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Table manners are formal, with an emphasis on respect for elders and tradition\n- Tipping is expected, 15-20% of the total bill\n- Reservations are recommended for popular restaurants\n- Dress code is casual, but elegant for special occasions\n- Mealtime is a time for socializing and enjoying good company\n- **Bendición**: it is customary to wait for the oldest person at the table to start eating before everyone else begins\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **La Placita de Santurce**: historic marketplace with food stalls and restaurants\n- **Old San Juan**: historic neighborhood with many restaurants and cafes\n- **Luquillo Kiosks**: beachside food stalls with local cuisine\n- **La Estación**: restaurant in a historic train station with traditional cuisine\n- **Food Courts**: many shopping malls have food courts with a variety of options\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **La Placita de Santurce**: historic marketplace with food stalls and restaurants, San Juan\n- **Mercado de Ponce**: marketplace with fresh produce and local cuisine, Ponce\n- **Luquillo Kiosks**: beachside food stalls with local cuisine, Luquillo\n- **Food Tours**: guided tours of the island's culinary scene, various locations\n- **Cooking Classes**: learn to make traditional Puerto Rican dishes, San Juan",
