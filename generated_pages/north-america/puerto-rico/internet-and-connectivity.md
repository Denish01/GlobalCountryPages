[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Puerto Rico is generally of good quality, with average download speeds of 18 Mbps, which is relatively fast compared to other Caribbean islands. However, there is a significant urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable connections available in cities like San Juan, and slower speeds in rural areas. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by the weather, with hurricanes and tropical storms occasionally causing outages and disruptions.

In terms of internet infrastructure, Puerto Rico has a well-developed network of undersea cables and fiber-optic connections, which provide fast and reliable links to the US mainland and other parts of the world. This has made it an attractive location for data centers and other internet-based businesses. However, the island's geography, with its mountainous terrain and rugged coastline, can make it difficult to provide internet access to some remote areas.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Puerto Rico, you can visit a store or kiosk of one of the main carriers, such as Claro, T-Mobile, or AT&T. You will typically need to provide a valid form of identification, such as a passport, and may need to pay a deposit or activation fee. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 20 USD, and you can choose from a range of data plans and packages. It's a good idea to check the coverage and pricing of each carrier before making a decision, as they can vary depending on your specific needs and travel plans.

The main carriers in Puerto Rico offer a range of tourist-friendly plans, including prepaid SIM cards and data packages. These plans can be a convenient and cost-effective way to stay online during your trip, and can be easily topped up or renewed as needed.
