[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private options available. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, but it is more affordable. Locals often rely on the public system for routine care, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals having access to public healthcare options and foreigners often requiring private insurance to cover their medical expenses. Having insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for those who plan to stay in Puerto Rico for an extended period.

The public healthcare system in Puerto Rico is managed by the Puerto Rico Health Department and includes a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, consists of private hospitals, clinics, and medical offices, many of which are affiliated with US-based healthcare providers. While the private system offers higher-quality care, it is also more expensive, with prices comparable to those in the US. Foreigners and those with private insurance often prefer the private system for its better facilities and more English-speaking staff.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, dial 911 or visit the emergency room at a nearby hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not be as widespread as in the US. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private hospitals, such as the Centro Médico de San Juan or the Hospital Auxilio Mutuo, which offer high-quality care and English-speaking staff. It is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency care, including knowing the location of nearby hospitals and having a means of transportation.

For non-life-threatening emergencies, it is recommended to visit an urgent care center or a private medical office. These facilities often offer faster and more affordable care than emergency rooms, and may be a better option for minor injuries or illnesses. Additionally, many private hospitals and medical offices offer 24-hour emergency services, which can be a good option for those who need immediate attention. [CALLOUT] It is essential to have insurance or a means of payment, as medical services can be expensive, and some hospitals may require payment upfront.
