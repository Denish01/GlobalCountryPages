[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico has a high level of infrastructure development, with significant investments in recent years to improve its roads, energy systems, and telecommunications networks. The territory's urban areas, such as San Juan, have modern amenities and services, while rural areas still face challenges in terms of access to reliable electricity, clean water, and high-speed internet. The government has been working to address these disparities and improve the overall resilience of the infrastructure, particularly in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017.

The Puerto Rican government has launched several initiatives to upgrade the territory's infrastructure, including a major road reconstruction program and investments in renewable energy. These efforts aim to enhance the territory's competitiveness, improve the quality of life for residents, and reduce its vulnerability to natural disasters. Despite these progress, challenges persist, particularly in terms of funding and maintenance, which can impact the reliability and efficiency of the infrastructure.

Puerto Rico's infrastructure development is also influenced by its relationship with the United States, as the territory relies on federal funding and support for many of its infrastructure projects. This has led to a mix of modern and aging infrastructure, with some areas boasting state-of-the-art facilities while others struggle with outdated systems.
