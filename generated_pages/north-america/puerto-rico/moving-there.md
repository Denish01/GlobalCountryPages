# Moving to Puerto Rico — Visas, Residency & Expat Guide

To move to Puerto Rico, you should start by researching the various visa and residency options, understanding the cost of living, and preparing for the unique cultural and logistical challenges that come with relocating to a US territory in the Caribbean.

[SECTION] Why People Move to Puerto Rico [/SECTION]
Puerto Rico has become an attractive destination for expats, digital nomads, and retirees due to its unique blend of Spanish and American cultures, stunning natural beauty, and favorable tax incentives. The island's warm climate, beautiful beaches, and vibrant cities make it an ideal location for those looking to escape the fast pace of city life and enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere. Many expats are drawn to Puerto Rico's **Act 60/22**, which offers significant tax breaks for individuals and businesses, making it an attractive location for entrepreneurs and remote workers.

The expat community in Puerto Rico is diverse, with many Americans, Europeans, and Latin Americans drawn to the island's unique culture and lifestyle. The majority of expats reside in the **San Juan metropolitan area**, which offers a wide range of amenities, including high-quality healthcare, education, and entertainment options. The quality of life in Puerto Rico is generally high, with a low cost of living compared to other US territories and states. However, the island's infrastructure and economy are still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Maria in 2017.

Despite the challenges, many expats find that the benefits of living in Puerto Rico far outweigh the drawbacks. The island's stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly people make it an ideal location for those looking to experience a new and exciting way of life. With its unique blend of Spanish and American influences, Puerto Rico offers a truly one-of-a-kind experience for expats and visitors alike.
