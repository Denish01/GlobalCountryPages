        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Cuba is an island nation located in the northern part of the Caribbean Sea, situated about 90 miles south of the southernmost tip of Florida, United States. It is part of the <strong>Greater Antilles</strong>, a group of islands that also includes Jamaica, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and Puerto Rico. Cuba is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the Caribbean Sea to the south, and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. The country's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe.</p>
        <p>Cuba's borders are primarily maritime, with the United States to the northwest, Jamaica to the southwest, and Haiti to the southeast. The country's coastline is characterized by a mix of rugged shores, sandy beaches, and coral reefs, making it a popular destination for tourists and a significant source of revenue for the local economy. The capital city, <strong>Havana</strong>, is located on the northwest coast and is the country's largest city, with a rich cultural heritage and a blend of Spanish, African, and indigenous influences.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Cuba's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, valleys, and coastal plains. The <strong>Sierra Maestra</strong> mountain range runs along the southeastern coast, with <strong>Pico Turquino</strong> being the highest point on the island. The mountains are covered in dense forests, including pine, cedar, and mahogany, and are home to a variety of wildlife, including birds, reptiles, and mammals. The central part of the island is dominated by a vast plain, known as the <strong>Cienfuegos Valley</strong>, which is fertile and suitable for agriculture.</p>
        <p>The northern part of the island is characterized by a mix of hills, valleys, and coastal plains, with the <strong>Escambray Mountains</strong> running along the northern coast. The coastal plains are generally narrow and are characterized by a mix of sandy beaches, rocky shores, and coral reefs. Cuba's coastline is also home to a number of <strong>islands and cays</strong>, including the <strong>Isle of Youth</strong>, which is located off the southern coast. The country's terrain and landscape have been shaped by a combination of tectonic activity, erosion, and human activity, including deforestation, agriculture, and urbanization.</p>
        <p>The country's water resources are also an important feature of its landscape, with a number of <strong>rivers and streams</strong> flowing through the island. The <strong>Cauto River</strong> is the longest river in Cuba, stretching for over 300 kilometers, and is an important source of water for irrigation, drinking water, and hydroelectric power. The country's <strong>wetlands</strong> are also an important feature of its landscape, providing a habitat for a variety of wildlife, including birds, fish, and mammals.</p>
