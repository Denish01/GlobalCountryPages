[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Cuba has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C (72°F to 82°F). This is the best time to visit Cuba, as the weather is pleasant and there is minimal risk of hurricanes. The wet season, which runs from May to October, is marked by high humidity and frequent rainfall, with an increased risk of hurricanes from September to November. The climate in Cuba is also influenced by its geography, with the mountainous regions being cooler than the coastal areas.

The seasons in Cuba have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, prices for accommodations and tourist services are higher, and popular destinations can be crowded. In contrast, the wet season is considered the low season, with lower prices and fewer tourists. However, some tourists may find the wet season appealing, as it offers a more relaxed atmosphere and the opportunity to experience Cuba's vibrant culture without the crowds.

Cuba's climate zones also vary by region, with the eastern part of the island being more prone to hurricanes than the western part. The island's geography also creates microclimates, with the mountains and valleys having distinct weather patterns. Understanding these climate zones and seasons is essential for planning a trip to Cuba, as it can help travelers make informed decisions about when and where to go.
