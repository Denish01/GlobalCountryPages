# Cuba Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Cuba's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy generation, and telecommunications, but still facing challenges in terms of rural-urban disparities and reliability.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 97% of population
Internet Penetration: 57%
Road Network: 60,858 km, with 29% paved
Rail Network: 8,285 km
Major Airports: 10
Major Ports: 15
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Cuba's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has made significant investments in recent years to improve the situation. The country's infrastructure is characterized by a significant urban-rural gap, with cities like Havana and Santiago de Cuba having better access to basic services like electricity, water, and sanitation, while rural areas often lack these amenities. The government has implemented various programs to address these disparities, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities. Despite these efforts, the country's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including a lack of maintenance and investment in the past, which has led to a deterioration of many facilities.

The Cuban government has also made efforts to attract foreign investment to support infrastructure development, with a focus on sectors like energy, transportation, and telecommunications. This has led to the establishment of several joint ventures and partnerships with international companies, which are helping to improve the country's infrastructure and increase access to basic services. However, the country's infrastructure is still vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to roads, bridges, and other facilities.

In recent years, the Cuban government has also made efforts to promote sustainable development and reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels. This has led to the development of several renewable energy projects, including wind and solar farms, which are helping to increase the country's energy independence and reduce its carbon footprint. Despite these efforts, the country's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, and the government will need to continue to invest in maintenance and development to ensure that the country's infrastructure can support economic growth and improve living standards.
