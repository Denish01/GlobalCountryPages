The market is characterized by a mix of old and new properties, with a strong demand for renovation and redevelopment projects. Currently, the market is trending upwards, with prices increasing steadily over the past few years, particularly in urban areas such as Havana. However, the rural market remains relatively stable, with lower prices and a more limited range of properties available. The **real estate** sector is expected to continue growing, driven by tourism and foreign investment, making it an attractive option for investors and buyers.

The Cuban government has introduced several initiatives to encourage foreign investment in the property sector, including the creation of **special economic zones** and the relaxation of restrictions on foreign ownership. However, the market remains subject to certain risks and challenges, including the impact of international sanctions and the need for careful due diligence when purchasing properties. Despite these challenges, the Cuban property market offers a unique opportunity for investors and buyers to acquire properties in a unique and culturally rich environment.
