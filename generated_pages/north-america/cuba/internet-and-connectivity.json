  "content": "The internet in Cuba can be slow and limited, especially outside of major cities like Havana, but it is possible to get online and stay connected with a local SIM card or WiFi access. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Cubacel, Nauta, Etex\nSIM Card Cost: 20-30 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Cuba is a relatively recent development, and the country's infrastructure is still in the process of being upgraded. As a result, internet speeds can be slow, especially outside of major cities like Havana. The **urban vs rural divide** is significant, with cities generally having better internet access and faster speeds than rural areas. Reliability can also be an issue, with outages and slow speeds common during peak usage times. Despite these challenges, the Cuban government has made efforts to increase internet access in recent years, and it is now possible to find internet cafes and WiFi hotspots in many parts of the country.\n\nIn general, the internet in Cuba is best suited for basic tasks like browsing the web, checking email, and using social media. However, streaming video or online gaming can be difficult due to the slow speeds and limited bandwidth. Additionally, the Cuban government has been known to restrict access to certain websites and online services, particularly those that are deemed to be counter-revolutionary or threatening to national security. As a result, **internet censorship** is a significant issue in Cuba, and visitors should be aware of the potential for restricted access to certain online content.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Cuba, visitors can purchase one from a local carrier like Cubacel or Nauta. These SIM cards can be bought at airports, phone stores, or other authorized retailers, and typically require a passport and some basic identification to activate. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 20-30 USD, and data plans are available for an additional fee. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as some smaller providers may have limited coverage or poor service. Data plans are available in various denominations, with prices starting at around 10 USD for 1 GB of data.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cubacel | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 10 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n| Nauta | Internet Plan | 2 GB | 20 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n| Etex | Data Plan | 3 GB | 30 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n| Cubacel | Add-on Plan | 1 GB | 5 USD | Add-on to existing plan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality can vary, but many high-end hotels offer reliable and fast internet access\n- Cafe WiFi culture is growing in Cuba, with many cafes and restaurants offering free or low-cost WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more common in major cities like Havana, and often offer high-speed internet and other amenities\n- Public WiFi is limited, but can be found in some parks and public spaces, particularly in tourist areas\n- Some museums and cultural institutions also offer free WiFi to visitors\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Havana's **Casa de Co-Working** offer reliable internet and a productive work environment\n- Cafe chains like **Cafeteria San Jose** offer free WiFi and a comfortable place to work\n- Backup internet options like portable WiFi hotspots or satellite internet can be useful in areas with limited connectivity\n- VPNs are recommended to access restricted websites and protect online activity\n- Some hotels and resorts cater specifically to remote workers, offering amenities like high-speed internet and meeting rooms\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a significant issue in Cuba, and some websites may be blocked or restricted\n- **VPN** use is recommended to access restricted content and protect online activity\n- Roaming alternatives like portable WiFi hotspots or satellite internet can be useful in areas with limited connectivity\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Cuba, so it's best to purchase a physical SIM card\n- Be aware of **data limits** and **overage charges** when using a local SIM card or data plan\n- Keep in mind that internet speeds and reliability can vary significantly depending on the location and time of day.",
