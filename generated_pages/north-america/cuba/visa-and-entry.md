The country also has several land borders with neighboring countries, although these are not commonly used for tourist travel. When arriving in Cuba, visitors will need to go through immigration and customs, where they will be required to present their travel documents and answer questions about their stay.

This card will be stamped by immigration authorities and must be presented when leaving the country. Visitors who lose their tourist card may face fines or other penalties, so it's essential to keep it safe and secure throughout their stay.
