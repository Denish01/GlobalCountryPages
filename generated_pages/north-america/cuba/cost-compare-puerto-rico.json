  "content": "Cuba is generally cheaper than Puerto Rico, with an overall cost of living that is around 30-40% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nCuba GDP per Capita (PPP): $9,900\nPuerto Rico GDP per Capita (PPP): $34,100\nCuba Inflation Rate: 6.5%\nPuerto Rico Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Cuba\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Cuba vs Puerto Rico [/SECTION]\nCuba and Puerto Rico are two distinct islands in the Caribbean, each with its own unique culture, history, and economy. Cuba, a socialist state, has a lower cost of living compared to Puerto Rico, a US territory with a more developed economy. The main reason for this difference is the lower cost of housing, food, and transportation in Cuba. Additionally, Cuba's economy is more isolated, which has led to a lower demand for goods and services, resulting in lower prices. On the other hand, Puerto Rico's economy is more integrated with the US, which has driven up prices due to higher demand and import costs.\n\nThe cost of living in Cuba is not only lower but also more stable, with a lower inflation rate compared to Puerto Rico. This makes Cuba an attractive destination for expats, students, and retirees who are looking for an affordable and predictable cost of living. However, it's essential to note that the quality of goods and services in Cuba may not be on par with those in Puerto Rico, due to the country's limited access to international markets and resources. Overall, Cuba offers a more affordable lifestyle, but with some trade-offs in terms of quality and availability of goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cuba (USD) | Puerto Rico (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $600 | 66% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $400 | 62% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $1,200 | 66% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cuba (USD) | Puerto Rico (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $15 | 66% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $30 | $100 | 70% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $1 | $3 | 66% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $0.50 | $2 | 75% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cuba (USD) | Puerto Rico (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $5 | $30 | 83% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $2 | 75% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cuba (USD) | Puerto Rico (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $20 | $100 | 80% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $50 | 60% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $30 | 66% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Cuba (USD) | Puerto Rico (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $400 | $1,000 | 60% |\n| Mid-Range | $800 | $2,000 | 60% |\n| Comfortable | $1,500 | $3,500 | 57% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Cuba is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing\n  - Food and dining\n  - Transportation\n  - Utilities and internet\n- **Puerto Rico is cheaper for:**\n  - Access to quality healthcare\n  - Availability of modern amenities\n  - International travel connections\n  - English language support\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nCuba offers a more affordable lifestyle, making it an attractive destination for expats, students, and retirees who are looking for a low-cost living experience.

For those who value affordability and a unique cultural experience, Cuba may be the better choice. For those who prioritize convenience, quality, and accessibility, Puerto Rico may be the better option.",
