[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Cuba are generally lower compared to the regional average, with the country's socialist economy and government-controlled food distribution system contributing to the relatively low costs. However, the limited availability of certain ingredients and the reliance on imports for some goods can drive prices up. Eating out is not as common in Cuba as it is in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home due to the affordability and availability of ingredients at markets and grocery stores. The **eating-out culture** in Cuba is mostly limited to tourists and special occasions, with many restaurants catering to visitors and offering a range of traditional Cuban dishes.

The cost of food in Cuba can also be influenced by the **US trade embargo**, which has limited the country's ability to import certain goods and has driven up the price of some staples. Despite this, the Cuban government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at increasing food production and reducing reliance on imports, including the development of **urban agriculture** projects and the promotion of **local food systems**. These initiatives have helped to improve food security and reduce prices for some staples, but the country still faces challenges in terms of food availability and affordability.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Cuba can be significant, with markets often offering lower prices for fresh produce and other staples. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have a wider selection of goods, including imported items, but at a higher price. When shopping at markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for bulk purchases or when buying from smaller vendors. In supermarkets, prices are generally fixed, but it's still possible to find deals and discounts on certain items.

When shopping in Cuba, it's a good idea to visit both supermarkets and local markets to get a sense of the prices and availability of different items. **Local markets** are a great place to find fresh produce, meats, and other staples at lower prices, while **supermarkets** may have a wider selection of imported goods and convenience items. By shopping at both types of establishments, visitors can get a better sense of the local food culture and make the most of their budget.
