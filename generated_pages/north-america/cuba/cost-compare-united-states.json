Cuba, a socialist state, has a planned economy with a strong emphasis on social welfare and government control, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, the United States has a mixed economy with a strong private sector, leading to higher prices for goods and services. Overall, Cuba is generally cheaper than the United States, with a cost of living that is approximately 50-60% lower. This is due to lower prices for housing, food, and transportation, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\nThe economic context of each country also plays a significant role in shaping the cost of living. Cuba's economy has been heavily influenced by its socialist system, with a strong emphasis on government control and social welfare. This has led to a more equal distribution of wealth, with lower prices for essential goods and services. In contrast, the United States has a more unequal distribution of wealth, with higher prices for luxury goods and services. As a result, Cuba is a more affordable option for those on a budget, while the United States offers more opportunities for luxury and convenience.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cuba (USD) | United States (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 1,300 | 84% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 900 | 83% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 2,500 | 84% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cuba (USD) | United States (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 15 | 66% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 150 | 66% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 1 | 5 | 80% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 0.50 | 2 | 75% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cuba (USD) | United States (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 5 | 100 | 95% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 2 | 75% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cuba (USD) | United States (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 20 | 150 | 86% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 60 | 50% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 30 | 66% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Cuba (USD) | United States (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 1,200 | 66% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 2,500 | 68% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 4,000 | 70% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Cuba is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices 80-90% lower than in the United States\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries 60-80% cheaper\n- Transportation, with monthly transit passes and taxi fares 75-95% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices 50-90% cheaper\n- **United States is cheaper for:**\n- High-end electronics and luxury goods, with prices 10-30% lower\n- International travel, with more frequent and affordable flights\n- Education, with a wider range of high-quality universities and colleges\n- Healthcare, with more advanced medical facilities and specialized treatments\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nCuba offers better value for expats, students, and retirees who are looking for an affordable lifestyle with a rich cultural experience.
