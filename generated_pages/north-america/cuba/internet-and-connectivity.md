[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Cuba is a relatively recent development, and the country's infrastructure is still in the process of being upgraded. As a result, internet speeds can be slow, especially outside of major cities like Havana. The **urban vs rural divide** is significant, with cities generally having better internet access and faster speeds than rural areas. Reliability can also be an issue, with outages and slow speeds common during peak usage times. Despite these challenges, the Cuban government has made efforts to increase internet access in recent years, and it is now possible to find internet cafes and WiFi hotspots in many parts of the country.

In general, the internet in Cuba is best suited for basic tasks like browsing the web, checking email, and using social media. However, streaming video or online gaming can be difficult due to the slow speeds and limited bandwidth. Additionally, the Cuban government has been known to restrict access to certain websites and online services, particularly those that are deemed to be counter-revolutionary or threatening to national security. As a result, **internet censorship** is a significant issue in Cuba, and visitors should be aware of the potential for restricted access to certain online content.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Cuba, visitors can purchase one from a local carrier like Cubacel or Nauta. These SIM cards can be bought at airports, phone stores, or other authorized retailers, and typically require a passport and some basic identification to activate. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 20-30 USD, and data plans are available for an additional fee. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as some smaller providers may have limited coverage or poor service. Data plans are available in various denominations, with prices starting at around 10 USD for 1 GB of data.
