Peak season: December to April. Budget season: May to June and September to November. Avoid: July to August due to the hot and humid weather, and September to November due to the risk of hurricanes. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nCuba has a tropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C (72°F to 82°F). This is the best time to visit Cuba, as the weather is pleasant and there is minimal risk of hurricanes. The wet season, which runs from May to October, is marked by high humidity and frequent rainfall, with an increased risk of hurricanes from September to November. The climate in Cuba is also influenced by its geography, with the mountainous regions being cooler than the coastal areas.\n\nThe seasons in Cuba have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, prices for accommodations and tourist services are higher, and popular destinations can be crowded. In contrast, the wet season is considered the low season, with lower prices and fewer tourists. However, some tourists may find the wet season appealing, as it offers a more relaxed atmosphere and the opportunity to experience Cuba's vibrant culture without the crowds.\n\nCuba's climate zones also vary by region, with the eastern part of the island being more prone to hurricanes than the western part. The island's geography also creates microclimates, with the mountains and valleys having distinct weather patterns. Understanding these climate zones and seasons is essential for planning a trip to Cuba, as it can help travelers make informed decisions about when and where to go.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Mild and sunny | Low | $ | Beaches, outdoor activities |\n| February | Mild and sunny | Low | $ | Romantic getaways, cultural events |\n| March | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Spring break, festivals |\n| April | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Outdoor activities, exploring cities |\n| May | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Budget travelers, off-season discounts |\n| June | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Summer activities, such as swimming and snorkeling |\n| July | Hot and humid | Medium | $$ | Summer festivals, cultural events |\n| August | Hot and humid | Medium | $$ | Family vacations, outdoor activities |\n| September | Hot and humid, risk of hurricanes | Low | $ | Budget travelers, off-season discounts |\n| October | Warm and sunny, occasional rain | Low | $ | Outdoor activities, exploring cities |\n| November | Mild and sunny | Low | $ | Cultural events, festivals |\n| December | Mild and sunny | High | $$$ | Holiday season, New Year's celebrations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Havana Jazz Festival | December | A celebration of jazz music, featuring local and international artists |\n| Santiago de Cuba Carnival | July | A vibrant carnival with music, dance, and costumes |\n| Havana Film Festival | December | A showcase of Cuban and international films |\n| Trinidad Carnival | February-March | A colorful carnival with music, dance, and costumes |\n| Viñales Tobacco Festival | February | A celebration of Cuba's famous tobacco industry |\n| Havana Book Fair | February | A literary event featuring book launches, readings, and discussions |\n| Bay of Pigs Museum Festival | April | A commemoration of the Bay of Pigs invasion, with historical reenactments and exhibits |\n| Camagüey Carnival | June | A festive celebration with music, dance, and costumes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The eastern part of Cuba, including the provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo, is more prone to hurricanes and has a more pronounced wet season.\n- The western part of Cuba, including the provinces of Havana and Pinar del Río, has a milder climate and is less prone to hurricanes.\n- The mountainous regions, such as the Sierra Maestra, have a cooler climate and are ideal for hiking and outdoor activities.\n- The coastal areas, such as Varadero and Cayo Largo, have a warmer climate and are ideal for beach activities and water sports.\n- The city of Havana has a unique microclimate, with a mix of urban and coastal influences, and is ideal for cultural and historical tours.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book accommodations and tourist services in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to June or September to November, for lower prices and fewer tourists.\n- Pack lightweight and breathable clothing, as well as sunscreen and insect repellent, to protect against the sun and mosquitoes.\n- Be aware of the risk of hurricanes, especially in the eastern part of the island, and have a plan in place in case of an emergency.\n- Avoid traveling during the holiday season, from December 15 to January 15, as prices are higher and popular destinations can be crowded.\n- Research and respect local customs and traditions, especially when attending festivals and cultural events.",
