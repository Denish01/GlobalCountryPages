[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Cuba has a relatively well-developed public transportation system, with buses and taxis being the most common modes of transport. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Havana having the most comprehensive network. Most people in Cuba get around using a combination of buses, taxis, and **colectivos** (shared taxis). The lack of ride-hailing apps and limited availability of rental cars make public transportation the most convenient option for many locals and tourists.

The transportation infrastructure in Cuba is largely state-owned, with the government operating most buses and trains. However, the country's economic situation has led to a decline in the quality of public transportation, with many buses and trains being old and in need of maintenance. Despite this, the public transportation system in Cuba is still relatively affordable and efficient, with many routes covering both urban and rural areas.
