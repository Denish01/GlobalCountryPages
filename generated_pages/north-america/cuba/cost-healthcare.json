  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Cuba can vary significantly depending on whether you access public or private services, with the country's healthcare system generally being considered high-quality and widely accessible, but with some limitations and costs associated with certain services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,199 (2020)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 16.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Universal\nEmergency Number: 104\nInsurance Required: No\nCurrency: CUP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nCuba's healthcare system is based on the principles of **universal access** and **free healthcare** for all citizens, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and community-based services. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-trained doctors and modern equipment, although there can be some shortages of certain medications and medical supplies. For foreigners, the situation is slightly different, as they are not automatically entitled to free public healthcare and may need to pay out-of-pocket for certain services or purchase private health insurance.\n\nIn practice, this means that locals can access public healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries, at little or no cost, while foreigners may need to pay for these services or have private health insurance that covers them. It's worth noting that some private healthcare services are available in Cuba, particularly in Havana, which can offer a higher level of care and more amenities, but at a significantly higher cost. Whether or not to purchase private health insurance is a personal decision, but it's generally recommended for foreigners who plan to stay in Cuba for an extended period or who have pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Public clinics are widely available, but private clinics may offer more personalized care |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Some specialists may only be available in private clinics |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | Private dental clinics may offer more advanced services and equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-20 | $20-30 | Some private clinics may offer more comprehensive eye exams and services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $20-30 | Public labs may have limited hours and services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Public hospitals have emergency rooms, but private hospitals may offer more prompt and personalized care |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-50 | Public hospitals are generally less expensive, but may have more limited amenities and services |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-500 | Private hospitals may offer more advanced surgical services and equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-500 | Public hospitals have maternity wards, but private hospitals may offer more personalized care and amenities |\n| MRI Scan | $100-200 | Some private clinics may offer more advanced imaging services and equipment |\n| X-Ray | $10-20 | Public hospitals and clinics have X-ray services, but private clinics may offer more prompt and personalized care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Covers public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Covers private healthcare services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Covers medical evacuation and repatriation, as well as international healthcare services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be purchased at public pharmacies, but there may be shortages of certain medications\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may be more expensive than in other countries\n- Private pharmacies may offer a wider range of medications and services, but at a higher cost\n- Some medications may only be available in private pharmacies or through special importation\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked with basic medications, but may have limited supplies of more specialized medications\n- It's a good idea to bring any prescription medications with you when traveling to Cuba, as they may not be available locally\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's best to call the local emergency number, 104, or go to the nearest public hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may be limited in some areas. For foreigners, it's a good idea to have a plan in place for emergency medical care, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of communication. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Cuba include the **Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital** in Havana, which offers a range of specialized services and has a reputation for high-quality care. It's also a good idea to research private hospitals and clinics in the area, as they may offer more prompt and personalized care, although at a higher cost.",
