        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Cuba is an island nation located in the Caribbean Sea, with a rich and complex history. The island was first inhabited by indigenous peoples, including the Taino and Ciboney tribes, before the arrival of European colonizers in the early 16th century. In 1511, the Spanish established the first permanent settlement in Cuba, and the island became a Spanish colony. Over the next several centuries, Cuba was a major hub for the transatlantic slave trade, with millions of Africans being forcibly brought to the island to work on sugar plantations.</p>
        <p>In the late 19th century, a movement for independence began to gain momentum, led by figures such as José Martí and Calixto García. On May 20, 1902, Cuba gained its independence from Spain, following a series of wars and rebellions. However, the new government was heavily influenced by the United States, which had occupied the island from 1898 to 1902. In 1959, a revolution led by Fidel Castro overthrew the authoritarian government of Fulgencio Batista, establishing a socialist state aligned with the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Cuba's socialist government has been in power ever since, with the Communist Party of Cuba being the only legal party. The country has been subject to a trade embargo by the United States since 1960, which has had a significant impact on its economy. Despite this, Cuba has made significant progress in areas such as healthcare and education, with high literacy rates and life expectancy. Today, Cuba is a sovereign state with a population of 11.1 million people, with the capital city being Havana.</p>
        <p>The country's history has been marked by periods of significant turmoil and transformation, with the revolution of 1959 being a major turning point. The socialist government has implemented a range of policies aimed at reducing inequality and improving living standards, including the establishment of a universal healthcare system and free education. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a struggling economy and limited access to certain goods and services.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Cuba is a small island with limited geography"</p>
        <p>Reality: Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with a diverse geography that includes mountains, forests, and coastlines along the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All Cubans are poor and lack access to basic necessities"</p>
        <p>Reality: While Cuba is a developing country with significant economic challenges, the government has made significant progress in providing access to basic necessities such as healthcare, education, and housing, with high literacy rates and life expectancy [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Cuba is a dangerous place to visit, with high crime rates"</p>
        <p>Reality: Cuba is generally a safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other countries in the region, and a strong emphasis on tourism and visitor safety [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "The Cuban economy is entirely dependent on tourism"</p>
        <p>Reality: While tourism is an important sector of the Cuban economy, the country also has significant industries such as sugar production, tobacco, and nickel mining, as well as a growing sector of small businesses and entrepreneurship [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All Cubans are opposed to the socialist government"</p>
        <p>Reality: While there are certainly Cubans who oppose the socialist government, there are also many who support it and see it as a necessary part of the country's development and independence [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Cuba has no access to modern technology or internet"</p>
        <p>Reality: While internet access is limited in Cuba, the country has made significant progress in recent years in expanding access to modern technology, including mobile phones and internet, with a growing number of Cubans having access to these services [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <h2>Challenges & Context</h2>
        <ul>

        <li>The country is heavily reliant on imports, with a significant trade deficit, and limited access to certain goods and services.</li>
        <li>Cuba has a rapidly aging population, with a significant proportion of the population aged 60 or older, which poses challenges for the healthcare and pension systems.</li>
        <li>The country is vulnerable to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which can have a significant impact on the economy and infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Cuba has limited access to certain medicines and medical supplies, due to the US trade embargo, which can make it difficult to respond to public health challenges.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Gets Overlooked</h2>

        <li>Cuba has a highly developed <strong>biotechnology</strong> sector, with a number of significant breakthroughs in areas such as vaccine development and cancer treatment.</li>
