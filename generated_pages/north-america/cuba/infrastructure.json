  "content": "Cuba's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy generation, and telecommunications, but still facing challenges in terms of rural-urban disparities and reliability.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 97% of population\nInternet Penetration: 57%\nRoad Network: 60,858 km, with 29% paved\nRail Network: 8,285 km\nMajor Airports: 10\nMajor Ports: 15\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nCuba's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has made significant investments in recent years to improve the situation. The country's infrastructure is characterized by a significant urban-rural gap, with cities like Havana and Santiago de Cuba having better access to basic services like electricity, water, and sanitation, while rural areas often lack these amenities. The government has implemented various programs to address these disparities, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities. Despite these efforts, the country's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including a lack of maintenance and investment in the past, which has led to a deterioration of many facilities.\n\nThe Cuban government has also made efforts to attract foreign investment to support infrastructure development, with a focus on sectors like energy, transportation, and telecommunications. This has led to the establishment of several joint ventures and partnerships with international companies, which are helping to improve the country's infrastructure and increase access to basic services. However, the country's infrastructure is still vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes, which can cause significant damage to roads, bridges, and other facilities.\n\nIn recent years, the Cuban government has also made efforts to promote sustainable development and reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels. This has led to the development of several renewable energy projects, including wind and solar farms, which are helping to increase the country's energy independence and reduce its carbon footprint. Despite these efforts, the country's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, and the government will need to continue to invest in maintenance and development to ensure that the country's infrastructure can support economic growth and improve living standards.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 60,858 km | Moderate | 29% paved, with many rural roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 8,285 km | Poor | Limited passenger services, primarily used for freight |\n| Airports | 10 international, 15 domestic | Good | Major airports like Havana's José Martí International Airport have been renovated and expanded |\n| Ports | 15 major | Moderate | Several ports have been upgraded to handle larger cargo ships and increase trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Cuba's power generation is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a mix of oil, gas, and coal-fired plants.\n- The country has made significant progress in developing **renewable energy** sources, including wind and solar power, with several large-scale projects completed or under construction.\n- **Energy efficiency** is a major concern, with many buildings and homes lacking proper insulation and energy-efficient appliances.\n- The country's **electricity grid** is still vulnerable to outages and blackouts, particularly during peak demand periods or after natural disasters.\n- Cuba has set ambitious targets to increase the share of **renewable energy** in its energy mix, with a goal of generating 24% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in many areas, particularly in rural communities where access to clean water is limited.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is often limited, with many communities relying on wells, springs, or other traditional sources.\n- The country's **water infrastructure** is in need of significant investment, with many pipes and treatment plants in poor condition.\n- **Wastewater treatment** is also a concern, with many cities and towns lacking adequate facilities to treat sewage and other waste.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic networks** are being expanded, with several major cities now having access to high-speed internet services.\n- The **4G/5G rollout** is ongoing, with several mobile operators offering high-speed data services in major cities.\n- **Postal services** are relatively underdeveloped, with limited access to mail and package delivery services in rural areas.\n- **Internet penetration** is increasing, but still lags behind many other countries in the region, with around 57% of the population having access to internet services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Cuban government has announced plans to invest over **$10 billion** in infrastructure development over the next five years, with a focus on energy, transportation, and telecommunications.\n- Several **foreign investors** have announced plans to invest in Cuba's infrastructure, including companies from China, Russia, and Europe.\n- The **Marriott International** hotel chain has announced plans to develop several new hotels in Cuba, including a major resort in Havana.\n- The Cuban government has also announced plans to develop several **new ports** and **logistics facilities**, including a major container terminal in the port city of Mariel.\n- The **European Union** has announced plans to provide significant funding and technical assistance to support Cuba's infrastructure development, including a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency.",
