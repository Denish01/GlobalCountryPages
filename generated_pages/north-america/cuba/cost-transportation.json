The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Havana having the most comprehensive network. Most people in Cuba get around using a combination of buses, taxis, and **colectivos** (shared taxis). The lack of ride-hailing apps and limited availability of rental cars make public transportation the most convenient option for many locals and tourists.\n\nThe transportation infrastructure in Cuba is largely state-owned, with the government operating most buses and trains. However, the country's economic situation has led to a decline in the quality of public transportation, with many buses and trains being old and in need of maintenance. Despite this, the public transportation system in Cuba is still relatively affordable and efficient, with many routes covering both urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.05-0.10 | $5 | Good coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Cuba |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.10-0.20 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | $1-5 | $10-20 | Limited availability, mostly for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5-10 | $0.50-1.00 | $10-20 | Limited availability, mostly in tourist areas |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | No major ride-hailing apps available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-30 | To city center, mostly by taxi or private transfer |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Limited availability, mostly for tourists |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | Limited availability, mostly for freight |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited availability, mostly in tourist areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-10 | Limited availability, mostly for highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Limited availability, mostly by state-owned companies |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | Limited availability, mostly by state-owned airlines |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-50 | Limited availability, mostly for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use **colectivos** or shared taxis to save money on transportation, especially for shorter distances.\n- Download local apps like Almendrones to find alternative transportation options.\n- Always negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, as meters are not always available.\n- Be prepared for limited availability of public transportation in rural areas.\n- Consider renting a car for longer distances or intercity travel, but be aware of limited fuel availability and high costs.\n- Use official taxi services or private transfers for airport transfers to ensure safety and reliability.",
