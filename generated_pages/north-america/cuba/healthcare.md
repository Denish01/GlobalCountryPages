The system is primarily funded by the government, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and community health centers providing a wide range of services, from routine check-ups to specialized treatments. The quality of care in Cuba is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and a strong focus on research and development. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas like Havana tend to have better-equipped and better-staffed facilities.
