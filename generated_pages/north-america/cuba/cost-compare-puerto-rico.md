[SECTION] Overview: Cuba vs Puerto Rico [/SECTION]
Cuba and Puerto Rico are two distinct islands in the Caribbean, each with its own unique culture, history, and economy. Cuba, a socialist state, has a lower cost of living compared to Puerto Rico, a US territory with a more developed economy. The main reason for this difference is the lower cost of housing, food, and transportation in Cuba. Additionally, Cuba's economy is more isolated, which has led to a lower demand for goods and services, resulting in lower prices. On the other hand, Puerto Rico's economy is more integrated with the US, which has driven up prices due to higher demand and import costs.

The cost of living in Cuba is not only lower but also more stable, with a lower inflation rate compared to Puerto Rico. This makes Cuba an attractive destination for expats, students, and retirees who are looking for an affordable and predictable cost of living. However, it's essential to note that the quality of goods and services in Cuba may not be on par with those in Puerto Rico, due to the country's limited access to international markets and resources. Overall, Cuba offers a more affordable lifestyle, but with some trade-offs in terms of quality and availability of goods and services.
