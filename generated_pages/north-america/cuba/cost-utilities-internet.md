[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Cuba's utility infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation services. However, the quality of these services can still vary depending on the location and time of year. For example, during the summer months, electricity consumption tends to increase, leading to occasional power outages and fluctuations in costs. Additionally, the Cuban government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency, which can impact utility costs.

The cost of utilities in Cuba can be stable, but it's not uncommon for prices to fluctuate due to seasonal variations and government subsidies. For instance, the cost of electricity is subsidized by the government, which can help keep costs relatively low. However, this subsidy can be adjusted, and prices may increase during periods of high demand. It's essential for residents and visitors to be aware of these fluctuations and plan their utility usage accordingly. Furthermore, the Cuban government has introduced measures to encourage energy efficiency, such as the use of energy-efficient appliances and lighting, which can help reduce utility costs in the long run.
