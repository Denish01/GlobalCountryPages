The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow pace, due to a combination of factors such as improved healthcare and a decline in mortality rates. Urbanization is a significant trend in Cuba, with approximately 77% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Havana and other major cities like Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey.
