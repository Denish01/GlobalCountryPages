[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Cuba's healthcare system is based on the principles of **universal access** and **free healthcare** for all citizens, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and community-based services. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-trained doctors and modern equipment, although there can be some shortages of certain medications and medical supplies. For foreigners, the situation is slightly different, as they are not automatically entitled to free public healthcare and may need to pay out-of-pocket for certain services or purchase private health insurance.

In practice, this means that locals can access public healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries, at little or no cost, while foreigners may need to pay for these services or have private health insurance that covers them. It's worth noting that some private healthcare services are available in Cuba, particularly in Havana, which can offer a higher level of care and more amenities, but at a significantly higher cost. Whether or not to purchase private health insurance is a personal decision, but it's generally recommended for foreigners who plan to stay in Cuba for an extended period or who have pre-existing medical conditions.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it's best to call the local emergency number, 104, or go to the nearest public hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may be limited in some areas. For foreigners, it's a good idea to have a plan in place for emergency medical care, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of communication. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Cuba include the **Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital** in Havana, which offers a range of specialized services and has a reputation for high-quality care. It's also a good idea to research private hospitals and clinics in the area, as they may offer more prompt and personalized care, although at a higher cost.
