Primary education, also known as **basic education**, lasts for six years and is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 11. Secondary education, also known as **pre-university education**, lasts for six years and is also compulsory for all children between the ages of 12 and 17. Tertiary education, also known as **higher education**, is offered at universities and other institutions and is not compulsory. The quality of education in Cuba is generally high, with a strong emphasis on **science**, **mathematics**, and **language**. Education is free and compulsory for all citizens, and there are no private schools in Cuba.\n\nThe education system in Cuba is highly centralized, with the **Ministry of Education** responsible for overseeing all aspects of education. The ministry sets the curriculum, trains teachers, and allocates resources to schools. The system is also highly subsidized, with the government providing free textbooks, uniforms, and meals to all students. This has helped to ensure that all children have access to education, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.\n\nDespite the many strengths of the education system in Cuba, there are also some challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of resources, particularly in rural areas. Many schools in rural areas lack basic amenities such as electricity, water, and sanitation, making it difficult for students to learn. Additionally, there is a shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in subjects such as **mathematics** and **science**.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
