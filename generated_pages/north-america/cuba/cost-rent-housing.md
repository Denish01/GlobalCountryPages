[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Cuba is relatively affordable, with prices lower than in many other countries in the region. However, the market can be challenging for foreigners, as the government tightly controls the housing sector. Typical lease terms in Cuba are for one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and landlords often have more power in the rental agreement. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as the United States, Jamaica, and Haiti, Cuba's housing costs are relatively low. However, the quality of housing can vary significantly, with older buildings in need of renovation and limited modern amenities.

Cuba's housing market is also influenced by the country's unique economic system, which includes a dual currency system and strict controls on foreign investment. This can make it difficult for foreigners to navigate the market and find affordable, high-quality housing. Additionally, the Cuban government has implemented various policies aimed at increasing access to housing, such as subsidized housing programs and restrictions on property ownership. Despite these challenges, many expats and tourists find that Cuba offers a unique and affordable housing experience, with a rich cultural heritage and a vibrant community.
