[SECTION] How Cuba Is Divided [/SECTION]
Cuba is divided into 15 provinces and 1 special municipality, Isla de la Juventud. The provinces are further divided into municipalities, with a total of 168 municipalities in the country. The administrative structure is based on a socialist system, with the Communist Party of Cuba playing a significant role in the government and decision-making process. The provinces are responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the central government handles national matters like foreign policy and economic planning.

The division of Cuba into provinces and municipalities has historical and geographical roots. The provinces were established during the Spanish colonial period, and they have been maintained with some modifications since the country gained independence in 1902. The provinces vary in size, population, and economic development, with some being more urbanized and industrialized than others. The special municipality of Isla de la Juventud, which is an island located off the southern coast of Cuba, has a distinct administrative status due to its unique geographical location and economic characteristics.
