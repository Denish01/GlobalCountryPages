The main international airports in Cuba are well-connected to major cities around the world, with airlines such as **Cubana**, **Air Canada**, and **American Airlines** offering regular flights. If you're planning to enter Cuba by land or sea, be sure to research the necessary documentation and regulations in advance, as these can change frequently. Additionally, consider purchasing travel insurance that covers Cuba, as some policies may not be valid due to trade restrictions.
