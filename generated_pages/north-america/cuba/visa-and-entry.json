Citizens of around 20 countries can enter Cuba without a visa, while many others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an e-visa system. The country's visa policy aims to balance tourism and economic development with security and immigration control.\n\nThe Cuban government has been working to simplify its visa process and attract more tourists, but certain nationalities, such as US citizens, are subject to specific restrictions.
