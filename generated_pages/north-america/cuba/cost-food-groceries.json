However, the limited availability of certain ingredients and the reliance on imports for some goods can drive prices up. Eating out is not as common in Cuba as it is in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home due to the affordability and availability of ingredients at markets and grocery stores. The **eating-out culture** in Cuba is mostly limited to tourists and special occasions, with many restaurants catering to visitors and offering a range of traditional Cuban dishes.\n\nThe cost of food in Cuba can also be influenced by the **US trade embargo**, which has limited the country's ability to import certain goods and has driven up the price of some staples. Despite this, the Cuban government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at increasing food production and reducing reliance on imports, including the development of **urban agriculture** projects and the promotion of **local food systems**. These initiatives have helped to improve food security and reduce prices for some staples, but the country still faces challenges in terms of food availability and affordability.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 40 CUP | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 15 CUP | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.00 | 25 CUP | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $0.50 | 15 CUP | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.00 | 80 CUP | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00 | 130 CUP | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.00 | 50 CUP | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 25 CUP | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.50 | 15 CUP | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.50 | 15 CUP | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $3.00 | 80 CUP | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 25 CUP | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 | (typical dishes like rice, beans, and chicken) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-15 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-30 | (3 courses, including drinks) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-70 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe price difference between supermarkets and open-air markets in Cuba can be significant, with markets often offering lower prices for fresh produce and other staples. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have a wider selection of goods, including imported items, but at a higher price. When shopping at markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for bulk purchases or when buying from smaller vendors. In supermarkets, prices are generally fixed, but it's still possible to find deals and discounts on certain items.\n\nWhen shopping in Cuba, it's a good idea to visit both supermarkets and local markets to get a sense of the prices and availability of different items. **Local markets** are a great place to find fresh produce, meats, and other staples at lower prices, while **supermarkets** may have a wider selection of imported goods and convenience items. By shopping at both types of establishments, visitors can get a better sense of the local food culture and make the most of their budget.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **cheapest way to eat** in Cuba is to buy food at local markets or from street vendors, where prices are often lower than in restaurants or supermarkets.\n- **Rice and beans** are staples in the Cuban diet and are often served together as a side dish, making them a good value for visitors.\n- **Fresh fruit** is widely available and affordable, with many markets and vendors offering a range of seasonal options.\n- **Local cheese** and **yogurt** are also good value, with many markets and supermarkets offering a range of options at lower prices than imported dairy products.\n- **Avoid buying imported goods**, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh or of the same quality as local alternatives.\n- **Try traditional Cuban dishes**, such as **ropa vieja** (shredded beef) or **arroz con pollo** (chicken and rice), which are often made with local ingredients and can be a good value in restaurants and markets.",
