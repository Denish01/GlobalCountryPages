[SECTION] Overview: Cuba vs Mexico [/SECTION]
Cuba and Mexico are two popular destinations in North America, attracting tourists, expats, and retirees alike. While both countries offer a unique cultural experience, they differ significantly in terms of cost of living. Cuba, with its socialist economy, has a lower cost of living compared to Mexico, which has a more developed and diversified economy. The main reason for this difference is the lower cost of housing, food, and transportation in Cuba. Additionally, Cuba's economy is heavily subsidized by the government, which helps to keep prices low.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Cuba's economy is largely dependent on tourism and remittances from abroad, while Mexico has a more diversified economy with a strong manufacturing sector. As a result, Mexico has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed infrastructure, which contributes to its higher cost of living. However, for those looking for an affordable destination with a rich cultural experience, Cuba is generally the better choice. On average, Cuba is around 20-30% cheaper than Mexico, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats.
