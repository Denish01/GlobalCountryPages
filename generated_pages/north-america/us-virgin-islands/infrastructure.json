  "content": "The infrastructure in US Virgin Islands is well-developed, with a strong focus on tourism and commerce, featuring a range of amenities and services that support the daily lives of residents and visitors alike. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 59%\nRoad Network: 1,257 km, paved and well-maintained\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nThe US Virgin Islands have a relatively high level of infrastructure development, driven by their strategic location in the Caribbean and their status as a US territory. Recent investments have focused on upgrading and expanding existing infrastructure, including roads, ports, and energy systems. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with the capital city of Charlotte Amalie and other major towns generally having better access to amenities and services. The islands' infrastructure has been impacted by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which have required significant investment in repair and reconstruction efforts.\n\nThe US Virgin Islands have a strong focus on tourism, which is a major driver of the local economy. As a result, the infrastructure is geared towards supporting this industry, with a range of amenities and services available to visitors.
