The reliability of the internet can also be affected by weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which can cause power outages and damage to infrastructure.\n\nThe US Virgin Islands' internet infrastructure is also influenced by its geography, with the islands' hilly terrain and limited landmass making it challenging to deploy and maintain internet infrastructure. However, the local government and internet service providers have made efforts to improve the internet connectivity, including the deployment of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile network coverage.
