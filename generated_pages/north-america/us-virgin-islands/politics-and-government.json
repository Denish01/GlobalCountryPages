The governor, who is also elected by the people, serves as the head of government and is responsible for appointing the members of the executive branch. The US federal government has authority over the territory, with the President of the United States serving as the head of state. The US Virgin Islands has a **mixed system** of government, with elements of both federal and unitary systems.
