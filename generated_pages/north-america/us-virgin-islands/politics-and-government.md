[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The US Virgin Islands has a **unicameral legislature**, with a 15-member Senate that is elected by the people for a two-year term. The governor, who is also elected by the people, serves as the head of government and is responsible for appointing the members of the executive branch. The US federal government has authority over the territory, with the President of the United States serving as the head of state. The US Virgin Islands has a **mixed system** of government, with elements of both federal and unitary systems. The territory has a significant degree of autonomy, with the local government responsible for most domestic matters, but the US federal government retains authority over foreign policy and national defense.

The **separation of powers** is an important aspect of the US Virgin Islands' political system, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing the laws, while the legislative branch is responsible for making the laws. The judicial branch, which includes the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands, is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are consistent with the US Constitution and the laws of the territory.

The US Virgin Islands' political system is also characterized by a **non-voting delegate** to the US Congress, who represents the territory's interests in Washington, D.C. but does not have the power to vote on legislation. This has been a source of controversy, with some arguing that the territory should have full representation in Congress.
