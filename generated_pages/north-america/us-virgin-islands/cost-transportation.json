The quality of public transit is generally good, with buses and taxis readily available on the main islands of St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix. Most people get around the islands by car, either by renting one or using taxi services. The roads are generally in good condition, but driving can be challenging due to the hilly terrain and narrow roads.\n\nThe US Virgin Islands are a popular tourist destination, and as such, there are many transportation options available to visitors. However, it's worth noting that the cost of transportation can add up quickly, especially if you're planning to explore the islands extensively.
