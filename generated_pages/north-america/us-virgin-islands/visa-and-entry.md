[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The US Virgin Islands has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of many countries allowed to enter visa-free for tourism and business purposes. The territory is a part of the United States, and as such, its visa policy is closely tied to that of the US. Citizens of over 40 countries, including those from the UK, EU, Canada, and Australia, can enter the US Virgin Islands without a visa for stays of up to 90 days. However, it's essential to note that even if a visa is not required, travelers must still meet specific requirements, such as holding a valid passport and proof of onward travel.

The US Virgin Islands' visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate tourism and business travel with the need to maintain national security and protect the rights of US citizens. As a result, the territory has implemented various measures to ensure that all visitors comply with its regulations, including the requirement to complete a customs declaration form and to present a valid passport upon arrival.
