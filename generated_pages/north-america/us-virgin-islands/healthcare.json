  "content": "Healthcare in the US Virgin Islands is a mixed system that combines both public and private providers, offering a relatively high standard of care, especially in the capital city of Charlotte Amalie.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 4/5\nEmergency Number: 911\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe US Virgin Islands' healthcare system is designed to provide access to medical care for all residents and visitors. The system is a mix of public and private providers, with the Juan F. Luis Hospital and Medical Center being the main public hospital. The quality of care in the US Virgin Islands is generally good, with many medical professionals trained in the United States. However, the system can be overwhelmed at times, especially during peak tourist season. Urban areas, such as Charlotte Amalie, tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas. The US Virgin Islands also has a number of private hospitals and clinics, which often cater to tourists and offer a higher standard of care.\n\nThe public healthcare system in the US Virgin Islands is funded through a combination of government subsidies and patient fees. The system provides access to a range of medical services, including emergency care, surgical services, and outpatient care. However, the system can be limited in terms of specialized care, and patients may need to be evacuated to the US mainland for certain procedures. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers a higher standard of care and a wider range of specialized services, but can be more expensive.\n\nOverall, the healthcare system in the US Virgin Islands is well-equipped to handle most medical emergencies and routine care needs. However, patients with complex or specialized needs may need to seek care on the US mainland. It is also important for visitors to have adequate health insurance coverage, as medical care in the US Virgin Islands can be expensive.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Juan F.
