King Airport on St. Thomas and Henry E. Rohlsen Airport on St. Croix. These airports receive direct flights from major hubs in the United States, including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and New York, as well as from other Caribbean islands. You can also enter the US Virgin Islands by sea, with several cruise lines and ferry services operating from nearby islands, including Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nIf you're planning to visit the US Virgin Islands, it's a good idea to book your flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, which runs from December to April. You can also consider flying into San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then taking a connecting flight or ferry to the US Virgin Islands. Overland entry points are limited, but you can take a ferry from Puerto Rico or the British Virgin Islands to reach the US Virgin Islands.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic flights are available between the main islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, although the network is limited. You can fly with airlines such as Cape Air, Seaborne Airlines, or Vieques Air Link, which offer regular services between the islands. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak season, as prices can be high and availability limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 per person, depending on the route and airline.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThe US Virgin Islands do not have a rail network, so you won't be able to travel by train. However, you can use the other transportation options available, such as buses, taxis, and ferries, to get around the islands.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus services are limited in the US Virgin Islands, but you can use the Vitran bus service, which operates on St. Thomas and St. Croix. The buses are a relatively affordable option, with fares starting from around $1, and they can be a good way to see the local scenery. However, the services can be infrequent, and the buses may not always run on schedule.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | St. Thomas, St. Croix | $1-$2 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $10-$20 | Metered fares, plus extra for luggage |\n| Ride-Hailing | St. Thomas, St. Croix | $10-$20 | Local alternatives, such as St. Thomas Taxi |\n| Ferry | Between islands | $10-$50 | Regular services, but limited schedules |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in the US Virgin Islands, you'll need a valid US driver's license or an international driving permit.\n- Road conditions can be poor, especially on secondary roads, so it's a good idea to rent a 4x4 vehicle if you plan to explore the islands.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high, with prices starting from around $3 per gallon.\n- Car rental companies are available at the airports and in major towns, but it's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak season.\n- Hazards to watch out for include potholes, roadwork, and aggressive drivers.\n- Be sure to drive on the left-hand side of the road, as the US Virgin Islands are a US territory that follows British driving customs.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced taxi fares or fake tour operators.\n- Use **cash** or credit cards to pay for transportation, as not all operators accept cards.\n- Download the **St. Thomas Taxi** app to book a ride-hailing service.\n- Always **wear a seatbelt** when driving or riding in a vehicle.\n- Be **patient** and **courteous** when driving, as road conditions can be challenging.\n- Consider **renting a car** for at least a day to explore the islands and their scenic beaches.\n- Take a **ferry** to travel between the islands and enjoy the scenic views.",
