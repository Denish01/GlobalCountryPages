[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The US Virgin Islands are easily accessible by air, with two main international airports: Cyril E. King Airport on St. Thomas and Henry E. Rohlsen Airport on St. Croix. These airports receive direct flights from major hubs in the United States, including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and New York, as well as from other Caribbean islands. You can also enter the US Virgin Islands by sea, with several cruise lines and ferry services operating from nearby islands, including Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands.

If you're planning to visit the US Virgin Islands, it's a good idea to book your flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, which runs from December to April. You can also consider flying into San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then taking a connecting flight or ferry to the US Virgin Islands. Overland entry points are limited, but you can take a ferry from Puerto Rico or the British Virgin Islands to reach the US Virgin Islands.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights are available between the main islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, although the network is limited. You can fly with airlines such as Cape Air, Seaborne Airlines, or Vieques Air Link, which offer regular services between the islands. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak season, as prices can be high and availability limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 per person, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The US Virgin Islands do not have a rail network, so you won't be able to travel by train. However, you can use the other transportation options available, such as buses, taxis, and ferries, to get around the islands.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus services are limited in the US Virgin Islands, but you can use the Vitran bus service, which operates on St. Thomas and St. Croix. The buses are a relatively affordable option, with fares starting from around $1, and they can be a good way to see the local scenery. However, the services can be infrequent, and the buses may not always run on schedule.

[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]
