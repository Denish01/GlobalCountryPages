The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, but it can be limited in its availability and specialized services, particularly for foreigners. Locals typically have access to public healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions, often at little to no cost. However, foreigners and tourists may need to pay out-of-pocket for these services or have private insurance to cover the costs. The quality of private healthcare in Aruba is generally high, with many private hospitals and clinics offering specialized services and modern equipment.\n\nThe healthcare system in Aruba is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for regulating healthcare services and ensuring that they meet certain standards. However, the system can be complex, and navigating it can be challenging, particularly for foreigners. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare in Aruba can be high. Many private insurance companies offer plans that cover medical expenses in Aruba, and some employers also offer health insurance as part of their benefits packages.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have limited hours and availability |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may have more flexible scheduling |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Private dentists may offer more specialized services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Private labs may offer faster results and more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Costs may vary depending on the severity of the condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Private hospitals may offer more luxurious accommodations and amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Costs may vary depending on the type of surgery and the surgeon's fees |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Private hospitals may offer more personalized care and amenities |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Private imaging centers may offer more advanced technology and faster results |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Private radiology clinics may offer more comprehensive testing and faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions, with some limitations on specialized services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | More comprehensive coverage, including specialized services, dental, and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation, with more flexible policy options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets\n- The cost of prescription medications can vary depending on the type and brand, but many common medications are available for $10-$50 per prescription\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts or loyalty programs for frequent customers\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked and offer a wide range of medications, including those for chronic conditions\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medications with you when traveling to Aruba, as availability and costs may vary\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or visit the emergency room at the Dr. Horacio E.
