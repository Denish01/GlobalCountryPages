[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Aruba is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **basisonderwijs**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 4 and 12 and is provided by public and private schools. Secondary education, or **voortgezet onderwijs**, is also compulsory and is divided into two main streams: **VMBO** (pre-vocational secondary education) and **HAVO/VWO** (higher general secondary education and pre-university education). Tertiary education is provided by the **University of Aruba** and other institutions, offering a range of academic and vocational programs. The quality of education in Aruba is generally high, with a strong emphasis on **Dutch language and culture**, as well as **Papiamento**, the local language. Public schools are free, while private schools charge tuition fees.

The education system in Aruba is overseen by the **Ministry of Education, Science, and Sustainable Development**, which is responsible for setting educational policies, curriculum development, and school management. The ministry also works closely with schools and teachers to ensure that students receive a high-quality education that prepares them for further study or entry into the workforce. In recent years, the government has implemented various initiatives to improve the education system, including the introduction of new curriculum programs and the provision of training and support for teachers.

Aruba's education system has a number of strengths, including a high literacy rate and a strong emphasis on **bilingual education**. However, the system also faces some challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers in certain subjects and a need for more vocational training programs. Despite these challenges, the education system in Aruba remains one of the best in the Caribbean region, with a strong reputation for academic excellence and a commitment to providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in an increasingly globalized world.
