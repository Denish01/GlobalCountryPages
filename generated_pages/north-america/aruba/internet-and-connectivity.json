The island's small size and relatively low population density contribute to a strong mobile network coverage, with all major carriers offering excellent coverage across the island. However, there is a notable urban vs rural divide, with faster internet speeds and more reliable connections available in urban areas such as Oranjestad, while rural areas may experience slightly slower speeds. Despite this, the overall internet quality in Aruba is high, making it an attractive destination for remote workers and digital nomads.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Aruba is also noteworthy, with most carriers offering a stable and consistent connection. This is particularly important for businesses and individuals who require a fast and reliable internet connection to stay productive. Additionally, the widespread availability of WiFi in hotels, cafes, and public areas makes it easy to stay connected, even when on the go. With the recent introduction of 5G networks, Aruba is well-positioned to support the growing demand for high-speed internet and data-intensive applications.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Aruba is a relatively straightforward process, with several options available for tourists and visitors. The two main carriers, Digicel and SETAR, offer a range of prepaid and postpaid plans, including tourist-friendly options with data, voice, and text. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will need to provide a valid passport and may be required to register their SIM card with the carrier. SIM cards can be purchased at the airport, carrier stores, or authorized retailers, with prices starting from around 20 USD for a tourist SIM.\n\nFor visitors planning to stay in Aruba for an extended period, it may be worth considering a postpaid plan, which can offer more data and minutes at a lower cost. However, for short-term visitors, a prepaid plan is often the most convenient option. It's also worth noting that some carriers may offer special promotions or discounts for tourists, so it's worth checking with the carrier before purchasing a SIM card.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Digicel | Tourist Plan | 1GB | 15 | Valid for 7 days |\n| SETAR | Prepaid Plan | 2GB | 25 | Valid for 14 days |\n| Mio | Data Plan | 5GB | 40 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Digicel | Postpaid Plan | 10GB | 60 | Monthly subscription |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally high, with many hotels offering free WiFi to guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is widespread, with many cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are available in Oranjestad, offering high-speed WiFi and other amenities for remote workers\n- Public WiFi is available in many areas, including the airport and tourist information centers\n- Many beaches and public areas also offer free WiFi, making it easy to stay connected while enjoying the island's outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces such as the Aruba Coworking Space and the Oranjestad Coworking Hub offer high-speed WiFi and other amenities for remote workers\n- Reliable cafe chains such as Starbucks and The Coffee Shop offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options such as portable WiFi hotspots and mobile networks are available for remote workers who require a reliable connection\n- VPNs are recommended for remote workers who need to access sensitive information or use public WiFi networks\n- Many hotels and resorts also offer coworking spaces and amenities for remote workers, making it easy to stay productive while on vacation\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major concern in Aruba, but some websites may be blocked by carriers or the government\n- **VPN** use is recommended to access blocked sites and protect sensitive information\n- Roaming alternatives such as prepaid SIM cards and portable WiFi hotspots are available for visitors who want to avoid high roaming charges\n- eSIM options are also available from some carriers, offering a convenient and cost-effective way to stay connected\n- Visitors should be aware of their data usage and avoid using public WiFi networks for sensitive activities such as online banking or shopping\n- It's also worth noting that some carriers may have **data throttling** policies in place, which can affect the speed and quality of the internet connection",
