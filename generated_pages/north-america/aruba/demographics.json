The population has been steadily increasing over the years, with a growth rate of 1.1%, driven by a combination of natural increase and migration. The majority of the population lives in urban areas, with approximately 42% residing in the capital city of Oranjestad. The population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to declining fertility rates and an aging population.\n\nAruba's population is characterized by a high level of urbanization, with many residents living in the capital city or surrounding urban areas. The island's economy is driven by tourism, which has led to an influx of migrant workers from other countries, contributing to the island's cultural diversity. The population is also aging, with a median age of 38.5 years, which has implications for the island's healthcare and social security systems.\n\nThe population of Aruba is relatively mobile, with many residents traveling to other countries for work, education, or leisure. This has led to the creation of a diaspora community, with many Arubans living in countries such as the Netherlands, the United States, and Venezuela.
