[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Aruba's utility infrastructure is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. The costs of utilities in Aruba are generally stable, with some seasonal variation. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The inflation rate in Aruba is relatively low, at 4.3% as of 2019, which helps to keep utility costs stable. However, it's worth noting that the high GDP per capita PPP of $50,649 in 2024 may contribute to a higher cost of living, including utility costs.

The quality of utility services in Aruba is generally good, with a high standard of water and electricity supply. The island's small size and relatively low population density also contribute to a more efficient and reliable utility infrastructure. However, as with any island nation, there may be occasional disruptions to services due to weather events or maintenance activities. It's essential to factor in these potential disruptions when planning your utility budget.
