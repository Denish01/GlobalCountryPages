  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Aruba can range from $150 to $300 per month for a medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and service providers.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($60 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($30 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.35 per kWh)\nCurrency: AWG\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nAruba's utility infrastructure is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. The costs of utilities in Aruba are generally stable, with some seasonal variation. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The inflation rate in Aruba is relatively low, at 4.3% as of 2019, which helps to keep utility costs stable. However, it's worth noting that the high GDP per capita PPP of $50,649 in 2024 may contribute to a higher cost of living, including utility costs.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Aruba is generally good, with a high standard of water and electricity supply. The island's small size and relatively low population density also contribute to a more efficient and reliable utility infrastructure. However, as with any island nation, there may be occasional disruptions to services due to weather events or maintenance activities. It's essential to factor in these potential disruptions when planning your utility budget.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | (propane or gas water heaters) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $15 | $20 | $25 | (included in water bill) |\n| **Total** | **$125** | **$185** | **$265** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $40-60 | 10-30 Mbps | Digicel, SETAR |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $80-120 | 60-100 Mbps | Digicel, SETAR |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $20-30 | 5-10 GB | Digicel, SETAR |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-50 | 10-20 GB | Digicel, SETAR |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | Digicel, SETAR |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (Aruba TV, available through SETAR) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Aruba, you'll typically need to provide proof of address and identification, and pay a deposit for each service.\n- Consider using prepaid electricity plans to avoid surprise bills and consider budgeting for seasonal variations in utility costs.\n- For internet services, choose a provider that offers a reliable connection and a data allowance that suits your needs, such as Digicel or SETAR.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using a water filter instead of bottled water.\n- Be sure to review your utility bills carefully and dispute any errors or unexpected charges with your service provider.",
