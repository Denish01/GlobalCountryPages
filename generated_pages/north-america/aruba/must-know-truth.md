Aruba, a small island territory in the southern Caribbean, is often misunderstood due to its complex history and cultural identity, but the reality is that it has a unique blend of Dutch, African, and indigenous influences that set it apart from other Caribbean islands.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Aruba was first inhabited by the **Caquetio** people, an indigenous tribe that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. The island was discovered by the Spanish in 1499, but it was the **Dutch West India Company** that established the first European settlement in 1636. Aruba became a Dutch colony in 1845 and remained under Dutch control until it was granted **internal autonomy** in 1986. Today, Aruba is a **constituent country** of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the Dutch monarch serving as head of state.
