Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Aruba before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nAruba has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of over 50 countries to enter visa-free for tourism and business purposes. The country's strategic location in the southern Caribbean and its status as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands have contributed to its open visa policy. Citizens of countries that do not require a visa can stay in Aruba for up to 30 days, and in some cases, up to 180 days. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is crucial to check with the Aruban authorities for the latest information.\n\nThe visa policy of Aruba is designed to promote tourism and facilitate travel for business and leisure purposes. The country's government has implemented various measures to simplify the entry process, including the introduction of an electronic visa system for certain nationalities. Additionally, Aruba has signed agreements with several countries to exempt their citizens from visa requirements, making it easier for people to visit the island.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | No visa required for tourism or business |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | No visa required for tourism or business |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | No visa required for tourism or business |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | No visa required for tourism or business |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | No visa required for tourism or business |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist eVisa | 30 days | Must apply for eVisa in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply for visa at Aruban embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can stay in Aruba for up to 30 days without a visa, provided they meet certain requirements, such as holding a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds.

Business travelers who require a visa must apply for a business visa at the Aruban embassy or consulate in their home country.\n**Students:** Students who wish to study in Aruba must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment at a recognized educational institution, as well as proof of financial support and health insurance. The duration of the student visa is typically one year, but it can be extended if the student continues to meet the requirements.\n**Workers:** Workers who wish to work in Aruba must apply for a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a local employer.

Visitors who require a visa must also present their visa approval letter or confirmation number.
