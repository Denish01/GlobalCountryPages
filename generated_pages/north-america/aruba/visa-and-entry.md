# Aruba Visa & Entry Requirements

To enter Aruba, citizens of certain countries do not need a visa, while others can obtain one on arrival or must apply in advance, depending on their nationality and purpose of visit.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Aruba has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of over 50 countries to enter visa-free for tourism and business purposes. The country's strategic location in the southern Caribbean and its status as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands have contributed to its open visa policy. Citizens of countries that do not require a visa can stay in Aruba for up to 30 days, and in some cases, up to 180 days. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is crucial to check with the Aruban authorities for the latest information.

The visa policy of Aruba is designed to promote tourism and facilitate travel for business and leisure purposes. The country's government has implemented various measures to simplify the entry process, including the introduction of an electronic visa system for certain nationalities. Additionally, Aruba has signed agreements with several countries to exempt their citizens from visa requirements, making it easier for people to visit the island.

**Tourists:** Tourists can stay in Aruba for up to 30 days without a visa, provided they meet certain requirements, such as holding a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds. Extensions of stay are possible, but tourists must apply at the Department of Immigration in Oranjestad before their initial stay expires.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers who do not require a visa can stay in Aruba for up to 30 days, but they must provide proof of their business activities, such as an invitation letter from a local company or a confirmation of their meeting schedule. Business travelers who require a visa must apply for a business visa at the Aruban embassy or consulate in their home country.
**Students:** Students who wish to study in Aruba must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment at a recognized educational institution, as well as proof of financial support and health insurance. The duration of the student visa is typically one year, but it can be extended if the student continues to meet the requirements.
**Workers:** Workers who wish to work in Aruba must apply for a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a local employer. The employer must demonstrate that they cannot find a suitable candidate from within Aruba or the EU, and the worker must meet certain qualifications and experience requirements.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The main entry point to Aruba is the Queen Beatrix International Airport, which receives flights from major airlines around the world. Upon arrival, visitors must proceed to the immigration counter, where they will be required to present their travel documents and complete a customs declaration form. Visitors who require a visa must also present their visa approval letter or confirmation number. The immigration process is generally efficient, but visitors should be prepared to answer questions about their purpose of visit, length of stay, and accommodation arrangements.

In addition to the airport, Aruba also has a seaport that receives cruise ships and private boats. Visitors arriving by sea must also proceed to the immigration counter, where they will be required to present their travel documents and complete a customs declaration form. The immigration process for sea arrivals is similar to that for air arrivals, but visitors should be prepared for potential delays due to the volume of passengers.
