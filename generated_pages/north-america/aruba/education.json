Secondary education, or **voortgezet onderwijs**, is also compulsory and is divided into two main streams: **VMBO** (pre-vocational secondary education) and **HAVO/VWO** (higher general secondary education and pre-university education). Tertiary education is provided by the **University of Aruba** and other institutions, offering a range of academic and vocational programs. The quality of education in Aruba is generally high, with a strong emphasis on **Dutch language and culture**, as well as **Papiamento**, the local language. Public schools are free, while private schools charge tuition fees.\n\nThe education system in Aruba is overseen by the **Ministry of Education, Science, and Sustainable Development**, which is responsible for setting educational policies, curriculum development, and school management. The ministry also works closely with schools and teachers to ensure that students receive a high-quality education that prepares them for further study or entry into the workforce. In recent years, the government has implemented various initiatives to improve the education system, including the introduction of new curriculum programs and the provision of training and support for teachers.\n\nAruba's education system has a number of strengths, including a high literacy rate and a strong emphasis on **bilingual education**.
