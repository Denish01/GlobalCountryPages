[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Aruba is considered one of the safest islands in the Caribbean, with a low crime rate compared to other destinations. The island has a strong focus on tourism, and as a result, the government and local authorities take visitor safety very seriously. The majority of crimes that do occur are petty, such as pickpocketing or theft, and are often opportunistic in nature. However, it's still important for visitors to take common-sense precautions to protect themselves and their belongings.

Despite the overall safety of the island, there are some areas that visitors should exercise caution in. For example, the San Nicolas area can be a bit rough around the edges, and visitors should be mindful of their surroundings, especially at night. Additionally, as with any popular tourist destination, there is a risk of scams and petty crime in areas with high volumes of visitors. However, these risks can be mitigated by taking basic precautions and being aware of one's surroundings.
