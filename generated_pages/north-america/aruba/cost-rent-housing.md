[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Aruba is relatively competitive, with a high demand for apartments and houses, particularly in the city center of Oranjestad. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one or two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to find apartments with amenities such as air conditioning, pool, and gym. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Curacao and Venezuela, Aruba's housing costs are relatively high, due to its strong economy and high standard of living.

The housing market in Aruba is also influenced by the tourism industry, with many apartments and houses being rented out to tourists on a short-term basis. This can drive up prices and reduce the availability of long-term rentals. However, for those who can afford it, Aruba offers a unique and desirable lifestyle, with a warm climate, beautiful beaches, and a vibrant cultural scene. The government has implemented measures to control inflation, which was 4.3% in 2019, and to promote education, with 3.6% of GDP spent on education in 2021.
