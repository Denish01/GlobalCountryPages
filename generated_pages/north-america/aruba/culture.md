# Aruba Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

Aruba's culture is a unique blend of indigenous, European, and African influences, shaped by its history as a Dutch colony and its strategic location in the southern Caribbean. 

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Aruba's cultural identity is defined by its diverse ethnic and linguistic makeup, with the majority of the population being of mixed European, African, and indigenous descent. The official languages are **Papiamento**, a creole language, and **Dutch**, reflecting the island's history as a Dutch colony. The population is also influenced by other languages, including Spanish and English, due to its proximity to Venezuela and the United States. This cultural diversity has created a distinct Aruban identity that is reflected in its customs, traditions, and way of life.

The island's cultural identity is also shaped by its history, geography, and economy. Aruba's strategic location in the southern Caribbean has made it an important hub for trade and commerce, attracting people from all over the world.
