[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Aruban property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a strong tourism industry and a limited supply of available land. The market is characterized by a mix of luxury **beachfront properties**, modern **condominiums**, and traditional **island-style homes**. Urban areas, such as Oranjestad and Palm Beach, tend to be more expensive than rural areas, where prices are generally lower. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available and relatively stable prices. However, the market is expected to continue growing, driven by increasing demand from tourists and foreign investors.

The price trajectory in Aruba has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with some areas experiencing higher growth than others. Eagle Beach, for example, has seen significant price increases due to its popularity with tourists and its limited supply of available land. In contrast, rural areas have experienced more moderate price growth, making them an attractive option for buyers looking for a more affordable entry point into the market.

The Aruban government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including the introduction of a **National Investment Policy** aimed at attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth. These initiatives have helped to create a favorable business environment, making Aruba an attractive destination for investors and property buyers.
