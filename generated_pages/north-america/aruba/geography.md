Aruba is situated in the southern Caribbean Sea, approximately 27 kilometers north of the coast of Venezuela. The island is part of the **ABC Islands**, which also include Bonaire and Curacao, and is located outside the hurricane belt, making it a popular tourist destination. Aruba is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and is separated from the South American mainland by a narrow strait.

The island's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region, with the capital city of **Oranjestad** serving as a major port and commercial center. Aruba's proximity to Venezuela has also led to a significant amount of cultural and economic exchange between the two countries, with many Arubans speaking Spanish as a second language. The island's borders are primarily composed of rocky coastline, with several small beaches and coves scattered along the shore.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Aruba's terrain is characterized by a flat, arid landscape, with a series of small hills and valleys running across the island. The highest point on the island is **Mount Jamanota**, which rises to an elevation of 188 meters above sea level. The landscape is dominated by **cacti** and other drought-resistant plants, which are well adapted to the island's dry climate. The lack of rainfall and poor soil quality have limited the development of agriculture on the island, with most food and other essential goods being imported from other countries.

The island's coastline is composed of a mix of rocky shores, sandy beaches, and small coves, with several popular tourist destinations such as **Palm Beach** and **Eagle Beach**. The coastal areas are also home to a variety of marine life, including sea turtles, stingrays, and colorful fish, which can be seen while snorkeling or scuba diving in the crystal-clear waters. Inland, the landscape is dotted with small villages and towns, including the capital city of Oranjestad, which is home to a mix of colonial-era architecture and modern buildings.

The island's geology is primarily composed of **limestone** and **volcanic rock**, which have been shaped by millions of years of erosion and weathering. The landscape is also home to several unique geological features, including the **Arikok National Park**, which covers nearly 20% of the island's land area and features a variety of unique rock formations, caves, and other geological wonders.
