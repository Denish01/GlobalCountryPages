[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Aruba is known for its high quality and reliability, with an average internet speed of 25 Mbps download. The island's small size and relatively low population density contribute to a strong mobile network coverage, with all major carriers offering excellent coverage across the island. However, there is a notable urban vs rural divide, with faster internet speeds and more reliable connections available in urban areas such as Oranjestad, while rural areas may experience slightly slower speeds. Despite this, the overall internet quality in Aruba is high, making it an attractive destination for remote workers and digital nomads.

The reliability of the internet in Aruba is also noteworthy, with most carriers offering a stable and consistent connection. This is particularly important for businesses and individuals who require a fast and reliable internet connection to stay productive. Additionally, the widespread availability of WiFi in hotels, cafes, and public areas makes it easy to stay connected, even when on the go. With the recent introduction of 5G networks, Aruba is well-positioned to support the growing demand for high-speed internet and data-intensive applications.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Aruba is a relatively straightforward process, with several options available for tourists and visitors. The two main carriers, Digicel and SETAR, offer a range of prepaid and postpaid plans, including tourist-friendly options with data, voice, and text. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will need to provide a valid passport and may be required to register their SIM card with the carrier. SIM cards can be purchased at the airport, carrier stores, or authorized retailers, with prices starting from around 20 USD for a tourist SIM.

For visitors planning to stay in Aruba for an extended period, it may be worth considering a postpaid plan, which can offer more data and minutes at a lower cost. However, for short-term visitors, a prepaid plan is often the most convenient option. It's also worth noting that some carriers may offer special promotions or discounts for tourists, so it's worth checking with the carrier before purchasing a SIM card.
