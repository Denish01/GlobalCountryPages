        <h2>How Jamaica Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Jamaica is divided into 14 parishes, which serve as the country's administrative divisions. These parishes are further grouped into three historic counties: Cornwall, Middlesex, and Surrey. The parishes are responsible for providing local government services, while the central government handles national issues. The 14 parishes are: Hanover, Saint Elizabeth, Saint James, Trelawny, Westmoreland, Saint Ann, Saint Catherine, Clarendon, Manchester, Saint Mary, Kingston, Portland, Saint Andrew, and Saint Thomas.</p>
        <p>The administrative structure of Jamaica is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services and the management of local affairs.
