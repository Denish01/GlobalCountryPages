[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Jamaica's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest and most widely accessible. The language of instruction is English, and compulsory education lasts for 11 years, from age 5 to 16. The public education system is generally considered to be of good quality, but it can be overcrowded and underfunded in some areas. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to have smaller class sizes and more resources, but they can be expensive and are often seen as being of higher quality. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of Kingston, and they offer a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.

The education system in Jamaica is overseen by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Information, and it is divided into several levels, including primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education lasts for six years, from age 5 to 11, and it is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in basic subjects such as English, mathematics, and science. Secondary education lasts for five years, from age 11 to 16, and it is designed to provide students with more specialized training in a range of subjects. Tertiary education is available at several universities and colleges, including the University of the West Indies, which has a campus in Jamaica.
