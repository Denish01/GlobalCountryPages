[SECTION] How Jamaica Is Divided [/SECTION]
Jamaica is divided into 14 parishes, which serve as the country's administrative divisions. These parishes are further grouped into three historic counties: Cornwall, Middlesex, and Surrey. The parishes are responsible for providing local government services, while the central government handles national issues. The 14 parishes are: Hanover, Saint Elizabeth, Saint James, Trelawny, Westmoreland, Saint Ann, Saint Catherine, Clarendon, Manchester, Saint Mary, Kingston, Portland, Saint Andrew, and Saint Thomas.

The administrative structure of Jamaica is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services and the management of local affairs. The parishes are governed by parish councils, which are responsible for providing services such as road maintenance, waste management, and public health. The central government, on the other hand, is responsible for national issues such as defense, education, and foreign affairs.
