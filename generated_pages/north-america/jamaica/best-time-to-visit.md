[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Jamaica has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by low humidity, plenty of sunshine, and minimal rainfall. This is the best time to visit Jamaica, as the weather is perfect for outdoor activities such as hiking, rafting, and visiting the beautiful beaches. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by high humidity, frequent rain showers, and a higher risk of hurricanes and tropical storms. The wet season is not ideal for visiting Jamaica, as the rain can make roads impassable and outdoor activities more challenging.

The climate in Jamaica varies depending on the region. The coastal areas tend to be hotter and more humid than the mountainous regions, which are cooler and more temperate. The Blue Mountains, for example, have a cooler climate than the rest of the island, with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F) throughout the year. The climate in Jamaica also affects the prices of accommodations and tourist services, with prices tend to be higher during the peak season and lower during the budget season.

The seasons in Jamaica also affect the types of activities and events that take place on the island. During the dry season, there are many outdoor festivals and events, such as the Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival and the Reggae Month celebrations. During the wet season, there are more indoor events, such as concerts and theater performances. Overall, the seasons in Jamaica play a significant role in shaping the island's culture, economy, and tourism industry.
