        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Jamaica is an island nation located in the Caribbean Sea, with a rich and diverse history dating back to the pre-Columbian era. The <strong>Taino people</strong>, the indigenous inhabitants of the island, first settled in Jamaica around 1000 AD. In 1494, Christopher Columbus arrived in Jamaica, and the island became a Spanish colony. The Spanish established settlements and introduced <strong>sugar cane</strong>, <strong>tobacco</strong>, and other crops, which became the backbone of the island's economy.</p>
        <p>In 1655, the British captured Jamaica from the Spanish, and the island became a British colony. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the British established a <strong>plantation economy</strong>, with sugar cane and other crops being produced for export. The <strong>transatlantic slave trade</strong> also played a significant role in Jamaica's history, with thousands of enslaved Africans being brought to the island to work on plantations. In 1834, slavery was abolished in Jamaica, and the island became a major producer of <strong>coffee</strong>, <strong>bananas</strong>, and other crops.</p>
        <p>Jamaica gained <strong>independence</strong> from Britain on August 6, 1962, with Alexander Bustamante becoming the country's first prime minister. Since then, Jamaica has developed a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong>, with a prime minister and a bicameral legislature. The country has also become a major player in regional organizations, such as the <strong>Caribbean Community (CARICOM)</strong>.</p>
        <p>Today, Jamaica is a <strong>sovereign state</strong>, with a diverse economy and a rich cultural heritage. The country is known for its <strong>music</strong>, <strong>art</strong>, and <strong>literature</strong>, with famous Jamaican artists including Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Louise Bennett-Coverley. Jamaica is also home to a number of <strong>natural attractions</strong>, including the <strong>Blue Mountains</strong>, <strong>Dunn's River Falls</strong>, and <strong>Negril Cliffs</strong>.</p>
