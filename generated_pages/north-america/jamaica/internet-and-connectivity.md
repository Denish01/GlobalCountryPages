[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
Jamaica's internet quality is generally good, with average download speeds of 10 Mbps, which is sufficient for browsing, streaming, and social media. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in major cities like Kingston and Montego Bay, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in Jamaica is also affected by the island's geography, with some areas being more prone to outages due to natural disasters like hurricanes.

In terms of internet infrastructure, Jamaica has made significant investments in recent years, with the deployment of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks. This has resulted in improved coverage and speeds, especially in urban areas. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in rural areas where internet access can be limited. Despite these challenges, Jamaica's internet is generally reliable and suitable for most users, including tourists and remote workers.
