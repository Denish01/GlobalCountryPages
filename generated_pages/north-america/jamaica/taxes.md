To be considered a tax resident in Jamaica, an individual must be physically present in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year or have a permanent home in Jamaica and be present in the country for any period during the year. The tax system is overseen by the Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ), which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services.

The tax authority in Jamaica has implemented various measures to encourage compliance and simplify the tax process, including online filing and payment systems. Taxpayers can also access various resources and guides on the TAJ website to help them understand their tax obligations and take advantage of available incentives. Additionally, Jamaica has a network of tax treaties with other countries to avoid double taxation and provide relief to taxpayers who earn income in multiple jurisdictions.
