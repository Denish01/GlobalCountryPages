# Jamaica Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Jamaica's infrastructure is a mix of developed and underdeveloped systems, with significant investments in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications, but still facing challenges in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 98% of population
Internet Penetration: 55%
Road Network: 22,121 km, with 76% paved
Rail Network: 272 km
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 7
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Jamaica's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other Caribbean countries, with a strong focus on tourism and trade. Recent investments have been made to upgrade the country's roads, airports, and seaports, with a focus on improving connectivity and facilitating economic growth. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address these disparities through targeted investment programs and partnerships with international organizations.

Despite these efforts, Jamaica's infrastructure remains vulnerable to natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, which can cause significant damage to roads, buildings, and other critical infrastructure. The country is also working to improve its resilience to climate change, with a focus on sustainable development and environmental protection. Overall, Jamaica's infrastructure is a key factor in the country's economic development, and ongoing investments and improvements will be critical to supporting growth and prosperity.

Jamaica's infrastructure development is also influenced by its geography, with the country's mountainous terrain and coastal location presenting both opportunities and challenges. The country's **transport infrastructure**, for example, is designed to facilitate the movement of goods and people around the island, with a focus on improving connectivity between major towns and cities. At the same time, Jamaica's **energy infrastructure** is focused on reducing dependence on imported fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
