[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Jamaica has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private facilities. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer wait times and limited resources. Locals often rely on the public system, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a referral basis, where patients are first seen by a general practitioner before being referred to a specialist if necessary. While health insurance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can be high and unexpected expenses can be financially devastating.

The quality of care in public hospitals is generally lower compared to private facilities, with limited resources and outdated equipment. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer high-quality care, with modern equipment and well-trained staff. However, these facilities are often expensive, and only accessible to those who can afford them. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in Jamaica, as medical costs can be high, and evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of a serious medical emergency.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In case of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 110 or visit the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not be prompt, and it is often faster to take a taxi or private vehicle to the hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners are the private facilities, such as the University Hospital of the West Indies, and the Andrews Memorial Hospital, which offer high-quality care and have English-speaking staff. It is also recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including your insurance provider and the embassy or consulate of your home country.

For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the emergency care options available in Jamaica. Many hospitals and clinics have international patient departments, which cater specifically to foreigners and offer a range of services, including translation and assistance with insurance claims. It is also a good idea to have a **health insurance** plan that covers emergency medical evacuation, in case you need to be transported to another country for treatment. Additionally, it is recommended to carry a **copy of your medical records** and a list of your medications, in case you need to seek medical attention while in Jamaica.
