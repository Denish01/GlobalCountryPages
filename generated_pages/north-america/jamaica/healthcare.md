[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Jamaica's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which operates a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics across the island. The quality of care in Jamaica's public healthcare system is generally good, with many facilities being well-equipped and staffed by trained professionals. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped and better-staffed facilities. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a range of services, from basic medical care to specialized treatments, and are often preferred by those who can afford them.

The public healthcare system in Jamaica is generally accessible to all citizens, with many services being free or low-cost. However, there can be long waiting times for non-emergency procedures, and the quality of care can vary depending on the facility and the location. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer a range of services, from basic medical care to specialized treatments, and are often preferred by those who can afford them. Private healthcare providers often have shorter waiting times and offer a higher level of care, but can be expensive.

Despite the challenges facing Jamaica's healthcare system, the country has made significant progress in recent years in improving the health and wellbeing of its citizens. Jamaica has a high **life expectancy** rate, with an average life expectancy of 75 years, and a low **infant mortality** rate, with an average of 10 deaths per 1,000 live births. The country has also made significant progress in reducing the incidence of **HIV/AIDS** and other infectious diseases.
