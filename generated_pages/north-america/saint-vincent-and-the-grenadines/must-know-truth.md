# The Truth About Saint Vincent and the Grenadines - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a sovereign nation located in the southern part of the Lesser Antilles, an island chain in the Caribbean Sea. The island of Saint Vincent was first inhabited by the **Ciboney** people, an indigenous group that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of Europeans. In 1498, Christopher Columbus sighted the island on his third voyage to the New World. The French established the first European settlement on the island in 1719, and it became a French colony. However, the British captured the island in 1762 during the Seven Years' War and it became a British colony.

The British and French fought over the island for many years, with the British ultimately gaining control in 1783. The island remained a British colony until it gained independence on October 27, 1979. The country's journey to independence was long and complex, with the first constitution being introduced in 1959. The country became a **associated state** of the United Kingdom in 1969, with internal self-government, before finally achieving full independence in 1979.

The Grenadines, a chain of smaller islands to the south of Saint Vincent, were also colonized by the French and British. The largest island in the Grenadines is **Bequia**, which has a distinct culture and history. The Grenadines were administered as part of Saint Vincent until 1979, when they became part of the newly independent country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

The country's history has been shaped by its strategic location in the Caribbean, with many different cultures and empires vying for control over the years. Today, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a **parliamentary democracy** and a member of the **Commonwealth of Nations**.
