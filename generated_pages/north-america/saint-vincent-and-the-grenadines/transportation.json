This airport receives direct flights from major hubs such as Miami, New York, and London, as well as connections from other Caribbean islands. Overland entry points are limited, as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is an island nation, but visitors can also arrive by sea, either on a private yacht or on a cruise ship that docks at the Kingstown port.\n\nFor those traveling from neighboring islands, there are also ferry services available, such as the ferry from Saint Lucia or Grenada. These services can be a more affordable and scenic way to arrive in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, but may take longer than flying. It's worth noting that the ferry schedule can be subject to change, so it's best to check with the ferry operator in advance to confirm schedules and prices.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is limited, but there are a few airlines that offer flights between the main island of Saint Vincent and some of the smaller islands, such as Bequia and Union Island. One of the main domestic airlines is **SVG Air**, which offers regular flights between these islands. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as the number of flights and seats available may be limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $200 USD per person, depending on the route and time of year.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, so trains are not an option for getting around the islands. This is due to the island's mountainous terrain and limited infrastructure, which makes it more feasible to use road-based transportation. As a result, visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to get around the islands.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThe bus network in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is relatively extensive, with buses connecting the main towns and villages on the island of Saint Vincent. The buses are generally **minivans** or small coaches, and they operate on a fixed route schedule. Fares are relatively affordable, with a typical ride costing around $1 to $5 USD. The buses can be a good way to see the island and meet locals, but they may not always run on schedule, so it's a good idea to check with the bus operator in advance to confirm times and prices.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Kingstown | $1-$2 | Frequent service, but may not always run on schedule |\n| Taxi | Kingstown, other towns | $10-$20 | Available at taxi stands or by phone |\n| Ride-Hailing | Kingstown | $5-$10 | Local alternatives, such as **Hire** or **SVG Taxi** |\n| Taxi | Bequia, Union Island | $10-$20 | Available at airports and ports |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, you will need to obtain a **local driver's license**, which can be purchased at the airport or at a local car rental agency.\n- The road conditions in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines can be **challenging**, with steep hills and narrow roads, especially in the rural areas.\n- Fuel costs can be relatively high, with gasoline prices around $1.50 USD per liter.\n- Car rental agencies are available at the airport and in Kingstown, and they offer a range of vehicles, from economy cars to SUVs.\n- When driving, be aware of **hazards** such as potholes, pedestrians, and livestock on the road.\n- It's also a good idea to **rent a 4x4 vehicle** if you plan to explore the rural areas or drive on unpaved roads.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** at the airport or port, where unauthorized taxi drivers may try to solicit your business.\n- Always **agree on a price** before you start your journey, whether you're taking a taxi or a bus.\n- Download **local apps**, such as **SVG Taxi** or **Hire**, to book a ride or get a quote.\n- Be prepared for **delays** or **cancellations** of flights or ferry services, especially during peak travel seasons.\n- Always **wear a seatbelt** and follow local traffic laws to ensure your safety on the road.\n- Consider **renting a car** for at least a few days to explore the island and its many attractions.\n- Don't **leave valuables** in your car or taxi, as theft can be a problem in tourist areas.",
