The airport receives direct flights from several major hubs, including Amsterdam, Aruba, and Curacao, as well as connections from the United States. You can fly to Bonaire from these hubs using airlines such as KLM, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. Additionally, there are no overland entry points to Bonaire, as it is an island territory, so flying is the primary mode of entry.\n\nThe main airport is relatively small, but it has all the necessary facilities, including a tourist information desk, car rental offices, and a taxi stand. When arriving at the airport, you can exchange your currency for US dollars, which is the official currency of Bonaire, or use an ATM to withdraw cash. You can also purchase a local SIM card or rent a mobile phone to stay connected during your stay. The airport is located about 3 miles from the capital city, and you can get to your destination by taxi, rental car, or shuttle bus.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nBonaire has a limited domestic air network, with no scheduled flights to other islands within the territory. However, you can take a charter flight or a helicopter tour to explore the surrounding islands and reefs. The main airline operating in Bonaire is Divi Divi Air, which offers charter flights to nearby islands, including Curacao and Aruba. You can book these flights through the airline's website or through a local tour operator. The cost of a charter flight can range from $100 to $500 per person, depending on the destination and the type of aircraft.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nBonaire has no rail network, as it is a small island territory with limited infrastructure.
