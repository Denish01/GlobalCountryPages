[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Bonaire's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, costs can fluctuate depending on usage and seasonal variation. The peak tourist season, which runs from December to April, can lead to higher electricity and water consumption, resulting in increased bills. Additionally, the island's remote location and limited resources can contribute to higher costs for utilities compared to larger countries.

The **Bonaire Utility Company** (WEB) is the primary provider of electricity, water, and gas on the island. The company aims to provide stable and affordable rates, but prices can still vary depending on usage and market conditions. Residents and visitors can expect to pay around $0.35 per kWh for electricity, which is relatively high compared to other countries. However, the use of **solar energy** and **energy-efficient appliances** can help reduce electricity costs and mitigate the impact of seasonal variation.
