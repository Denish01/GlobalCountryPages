  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Bonaire can range from $200 to $500 per month for a medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and service providers.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($350 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($100 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($30 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.35 per kWh)\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nBonaire's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, costs can fluctuate depending on usage and seasonal variation. The peak tourist season, which runs from December to April, can lead to higher electricity and water consumption, resulting in increased bills. Additionally, the island's remote location and limited resources can contribute to higher costs for utilities compared to larger countries.\n\nThe **Bonaire Utility Company** (WEB) is the primary provider of electricity, water, and gas on the island. The company aims to provide stable and affordable rates, but prices can still vary depending on usage and market conditions. Residents and visitors can expect to pay around $0.35 per kWh for electricity, which is relatively high compared to other countries. However, the use of **solar energy** and **energy-efficient appliances** can help reduce electricity costs and mitigate the impact of seasonal variation.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $100 | $150 | $250 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $50 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $25 | (propane or gas stove) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $15 | $20 | $30 | (included in property tax) |\n| **Total** | **$145** | **$215** | **$355** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 10-20 Mbps | Flow, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 60-100 Mbps | Flow, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Digicel, Chippie |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 5-20 GB | Digicel, Chippie |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $100-200 | varies | Flow, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (Bonaire-based streaming services) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents and visitors can contact the Bonaire Utility Company (WEB) or visit their website to apply for services.\n- Prepaid electricity options are available for those who want to monitor and control their usage.\n- The best internet providers in Bonaire are Flow and Digicel, offering reliable and fast connections.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using **energy-efficient appliances**, **solar panels**, and **rainwater harvesting systems**.\n- Regularly checking and maintaining appliances and systems can also help reduce waste and lower utility costs.",
