[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Bonaire's main international airport is Flamingo International Airport, which is located near the capital city of Kralendijk. The airport receives direct flights from several major hubs, including Amsterdam, Aruba, and Curacao, as well as connections from the United States. You can fly to Bonaire from these hubs using airlines such as KLM, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. Additionally, there are no overland entry points to Bonaire, as it is an island territory, so flying is the primary mode of entry.

The main airport is relatively small, but it has all the necessary facilities, including a tourist information desk, car rental offices, and a taxi stand. When arriving at the airport, you can exchange your currency for US dollars, which is the official currency of Bonaire, or use an ATM to withdraw cash. You can also purchase a local SIM card or rent a mobile phone to stay connected during your stay. The airport is located about 3 miles from the capital city, and you can get to your destination by taxi, rental car, or shuttle bus.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Bonaire has a limited domestic air network, with no scheduled flights to other islands within the territory. However, you can take a charter flight or a helicopter tour to explore the surrounding islands and reefs. The main airline operating in Bonaire is Divi Divi Air, which offers charter flights to nearby islands, including Curacao and Aruba. You can book these flights through the airline's website or through a local tour operator. The cost of a charter flight can range from $100 to $500 per person, depending on the destination and the type of aircraft.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Bonaire has no rail network, as it is a small island territory with limited infrastructure. As a result, there are no trains or railways to speak of, and visitors must rely on other modes of transportation, such as taxis, rental cars, and bicycles. This can be a blessing in disguise, as the island's scenic roads and lack of traffic make it an ideal destination for exploring by car or bike.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There is no public bus system in Bonaire, and the only way to get around the island is by using taxis, rental cars, or bicycles. However, some hotels and resorts offer shuttle bus services to and from the airport, as well as to nearby attractions and beaches. You can also hire a private coach or taxi for the day to explore the island, which can be a more convenient and comfortable option.
