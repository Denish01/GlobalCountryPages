[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Bonaire is a small island, and getting around is relatively easy. The main transportation modes include **rental cars**, **taxis**, and **bicycles**. The quality of public transit is limited, with only a few bus routes available, but most people get around by car or bike due to the island's small size and lack of comprehensive public transportation. The island's flat terrain and scenic roads make it an ideal place for cycling, and many tourists opt for this mode of transportation to explore the island.

The lack of a comprehensive public transportation system means that many residents and tourists rely on private vehicles or taxis to get around. However, the island's small size and limited traffic make it easy to navigate, and many destinations are within walking or cycling distance. Additionally, the island's **tourist information office** provides maps and information on getting around the island, including bus schedules and taxi services.
