  "content": "The population of Bosnia and Herzegovina is approximately 3.2 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 3.2 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.1%\nMedian Age: 43 years\nUrban Population: 49%\nPopulation Density: 66 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 77 years\nFertility Rate: 1.3 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe population of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been steadily declining over the past few decades, due to a combination of low fertility rates, high emigration rates, and an aging population. The country's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, and its growth rate is one of the lowest in the region. The urban population is approximately 49%, with the majority of people living in cities such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, and Mostar. The population density is relatively low, with an average of 66 people per square kilometer.\n\nThe country's population has been affected by migration patterns, with many young people leaving the country in search of better economic opportunities. This has resulted in a significant brain drain, as well as a decline in the working-age population. The government has implemented various policies to try to stem the flow of emigration, including investments in education and job creation programs. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of population growth and development.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich cultural heritage and a diverse population, with a mix of urban and rural communities. The country's population is spread across a range of geographic regions, from the mountains of the north to the coastal regions of the south. This diversity has contributed to the country's unique cultural identity and has helped to shape its history and traditions.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bosniaks | 50.1% | Central and northern regions | Largest ethnic group |\n| Serbs | 30.8% | Eastern and western regions | Second-largest ethnic group |\n| Croats | 15.4% | Southern and western regions | Third-largest ethnic group |\n| Others | 3.7% | Throughout the country | Includes minority groups such as Roma and Jews |\n| Bosnian Serbs | 2.5% | Eastern regions | Recognized as a distinct ethnic group |\n| Bosnian Croats | 1.5% | Southern regions | Recognized as a distinct ethnic group |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina have a complex and often sensitive history, with tensions between the different groups contributing to the country's turbulent past. However, in recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of diversity and inclusivity, with efforts to promote ethnic relations and understanding. The country's constitution recognizes the three main ethnic groups - Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats - as constituent peoples, and provides for the protection of their rights and interests.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Bosnian** is the official language, spoken by the majority of the population\n- **Croatian** and **Serbian** are also widely spoken, particularly in areas with significant Croatian and Serbian populations\n- **English** is becoming increasingly popular as a second language, particularly among younger people\n- **German** and **Turkish** are also spoken by some members of the population, particularly in urban areas\n- **Romani** is spoken by the Roma minority, who are recognized as a distinct ethnic group\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Islam | 50.7% | Dominant religion among Bosniaks |\n| Orthodoxy | 30.7% | Dominant religion among Serbs |\n| Catholicism | 15.2% | Dominant religion among Croats |\n| Atheism | 2.5% | Growing trend, particularly among younger people |\n| Other | 0.9% | Includes minority groups such as Jews and Protestants |\n[/TABLE]\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a multi-religious country, with a mix of Islamic, Orthodox, and Catholic traditions.
