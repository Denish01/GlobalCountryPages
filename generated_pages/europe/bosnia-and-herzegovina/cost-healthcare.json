The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, but it is still accessible to all citizens and foreigners with health insurance. Locals typically use the public healthcare system, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare due to language barriers and perceived higher quality of care. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and health insurance contributions, while private healthcare is largely paid out-of-pocket or through private health insurance.\n\nThe healthcare system in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be complex and bureaucratic, with long waiting times for non-emergency procedures in the public sector. However, private healthcare providers offer a range of services, including specialist consultations, diagnostic tests, and surgical procedures, often with shorter waiting times and more modern facilities. It is recommended that foreigners and expats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of private healthcare can be high.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | public healthcare often requires a referral from a primary care physician |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | private specialists may have shorter waiting times and more modern facilities |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | private dental clinics offer a range of services, including cosmetic dentistry |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$60 | private optometrists may have more modern equipment and a wider range of services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | private laboratories may offer faster turnaround times and more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | public hospitals may have longer waiting times and less modern facilities |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations and better amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons and better equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,500 | private hospitals often have more modern facilities and better prenatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | private diagnostic centers may offer faster turnaround times and more comprehensive imaging |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | public hospitals may have older equipment and longer waiting times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | private healthcare services, including specialist consultations and diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | comprehensive coverage, including emergency evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a licensed physician\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and some supermarkets\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antihistamines can cost between $5-$10\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and quantity\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas\n- Some pharmacies may offer delivery or online ordering services, but this is not always available\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112 or visit the nearest hospital.
