[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure since the 1990s, with a focus on rebuilding and expanding its transportation networks, energy sector, and telecommunications. However, the country still faces challenges in terms of providing equal access to modern infrastructure for both urban and rural areas. Recent investments have been made to upgrade the country's roads, railways, and airports, with a focus on improving connectivity with neighboring countries. Despite these efforts, there is still a notable gap in infrastructure development between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity, clean water, and high-speed internet.

The country's infrastructure development has been supported by international organizations and foreign investors, who have provided funding and expertise to help modernize the country's infrastructure. This has included investments in the energy sector, with a focus on increasing the use of renewable energy sources and improving the efficiency of the country's power grid. Additionally, efforts have been made to upgrade the country's telecommunications infrastructure, with a focus on expanding access to high-speed internet and mobile phone coverage.

Overall, while Bosnia and Herzegovina still faces significant challenges in terms of its infrastructure development, the country has made notable progress in recent years and is continuing to invest in modernizing its systems. This is expected to have a positive impact on the country's economy and quality of life for its citizens.
