Public education is generally considered to be of good quality, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. However, private schools often offer more modern facilities and a wider range of extracurricular activities, making them a popular choice for families who can afford the higher fees. The language of instruction is typically Bosnian, Croatian, or Serbian, although some private schools may offer English or other languages as an option. Compulsory education lasts for 9 years, from age 6 to 15, and is divided into primary and secondary education.\n\nThe education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is overseen by the Ministry of Education and Science, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards and overseeing the administration of schools. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities such as Sarajevo, and offer a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). These schools cater to expatriate families and local students who want to pursue higher education abroad. The quality of education in Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally considered to be good, although there are some variations between public and private schools, as well as between different regions.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, modern facilities |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range of extracurricular activities, smaller class sizes |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Emphasis on core subjects, some vocational training |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$3,500 | Wider range of subjects, better facilities, more extracurricular activities |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | IB, CIE, or other international curricula, experienced teachers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,500 | $2,000-$3,500 | Wide range of programs, affordable fees |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,500-$6,000 | Smaller class sizes, more modern facilities |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,500-$3,000 | $3,000-$5,000 | University of Sarajevo, high-quality programs, research opportunities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Limited availability, especially outside major cities |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Available for a range of subjects, experienced tutors |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Various languages, including English, German, and Turkish |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, including books, pencils, and paper |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for some private and public schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The University of Sarajevo is one of the top-ranked universities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, offering a wide range of programs and research opportunities.\n- International schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina offer a range of curricula, including the IB and CIE, and are a good option for expatriate families.\n- Private tutoring is widely available and can be a good option for students who need extra support or want to improve their grades.\n- Scholarships are available for students who want to pursue higher education, both locally and internationally.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally considered to be of good quality, although there are some variations between public and private schools, as well as between different regions.",
