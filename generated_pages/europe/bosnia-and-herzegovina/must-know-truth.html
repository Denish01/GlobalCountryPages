        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina, a sovereign country located in Southeastern Europe, has a complex and rich history. The territory that is now Bosnia and Herzegovina was inhabited by various ancient civilizations, including the Illyrians and the Romans. In the 7th century, Slavic tribes migrated to the region, and by the 10th century, the area was divided into several medieval kingdoms. The <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> conquered Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 15th century, and the territory remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 400 years. During this period, many Bosnians converted to <strong>Islam</strong>, which would later become a significant factor in the country's cultural and social identity.</p>
        <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Bosnia and Herzegovina became a point of contention between European powers, particularly <strong>Austria-Hungary</strong> and <strong>Serbia</strong>. In 1878, Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in 1908, it formally annexed the territory. This move was met with resistance from Serbia and other neighboring countries, which ultimately contributed to the outbreak of <strong>World War I</strong>. Following the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the <strong>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</strong>, a state that included present-day Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and Macedonia.</p>
        <p>During <strong>World War II</strong>, Bosnia and Herzegovina was invaded and occupied by <strong>Nazi Germany</strong> and <strong>Fascist Italy</strong>. The country suffered significant losses and damage during the war, and many Bosnians were killed or displaced. After the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six republics that made up the <strong>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</strong>, a communist state led by <strong>Josip Broz Tito</strong>. In the early 1990s, Yugoslavia began to dissolve, and Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence in 1992. However, this move was met with resistance from <strong>Serbian</strong> and <strong>Croatian</strong> forces, which led to a devastating <strong>civil war</strong> that lasted from 1992 to 1995.</p>
        <p>The Dayton Peace Accords, signed in 1995, brought an end to the war and established Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state. The country has since made significant progress in rebuilding and recovering from the war, but it still faces many challenges and complexities. Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> with a complex system of government, which includes a tripartite presidency and a bicameral legislature.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>

        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "The economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is primarily based on agriculture."</p>
