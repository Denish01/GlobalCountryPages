Compulsory education lasts for 9 years, from age 6 to 15, and is divided into primary and secondary education.

The education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is overseen by the Ministry of Education and Science, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards and overseeing the administration of schools. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities such as Sarajevo, and offer a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). These schools cater to expatriate families and local students who want to pursue higher education abroad. The quality of education in Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally considered to be good, although there are some variations between public and private schools, as well as between different regions.
