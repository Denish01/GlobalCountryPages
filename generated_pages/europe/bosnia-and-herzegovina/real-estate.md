[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still recovering from the impact of the 1990s war, but it has shown significant growth in recent years, driven by foreign investment and a growing tourism industry. The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a strong demand for modern apartments and offices in urban areas. The price trajectory has been steadily increasing, with a growth rate of around 5-10% per year. Urban areas, such as Sarajevo and Mostar, are more expensive than rural areas, where prices are generally lower.

The market is also influenced by the country's complex administrative system, with three main ethnic groups - Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs - having their own separate entities and regulations. This can create challenges for foreign investors, but also opportunities for those who are willing to navigate the system. The government has been working to simplify the process of buying and owning property, and to attract more foreign investment.

The rental market is also growing, with a high demand for short-term rentals in tourist areas and long-term rentals in urban centers. The yield on rental properties is around 5-7%, which is relatively high compared to other European countries. However, the market is still relatively undeveloped, and there are opportunities for investors to capitalize on the growing demand for high-quality rental properties.
