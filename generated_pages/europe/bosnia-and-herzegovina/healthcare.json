  "content": "Healthcare in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a mixed system that provides a wide range of medical services, with both public and private providers offering various levels of care, although the quality and accessibility can vary greatly between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Adequate\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on a **social health insurance** model, where all citizens are required to have health insurance, either through their employer or by purchasing it privately. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and insurance premiums, while private healthcare providers offer additional services for those who can afford them. The quality of care in Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally considered to be good, with well-trained healthcare professionals and modern medical equipment available in many hospitals and clinics. However, there are still significant disparities between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to specialized care and modern medical facilities.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Bosnia and Herzegovina provides a wide range of medical services, including primary care, specialized care, and hospital services. However, the system is often criticized for being bureaucratic and inefficient, with long waiting times for non-emergency procedures and a lack of modern medical equipment in some areas. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a wider range of services and more modern facilities, but are often more expensive and may not be accessible to all citizens.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services, improving the quality of care, and reducing healthcare costs. The government has also implemented various initiatives to promote **preventive care** and **public health**, including vaccination programs, health education campaigns, and screenings for chronic diseases.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| University Clinical Center of Sarajevo | Sarajevo | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Clinical Center of the University of Banja Luka | Banja Luka | Public | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Limited |\n| Hospital Sv.
