[SECTION] Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina vs Montenegro [/SECTION]
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro are two neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe, both offering a unique blend of natural beauty, rich history, and cultural heritage. However, when it comes to the cost of living, there are some significant differences between the two countries. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a lower cost of living, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being generally lower than in Montenegro. This is largely due to the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina is still recovering from the economic impact of the Yugoslav wars, which has kept prices relatively low. In contrast, Montenegro has experienced rapid economic growth in recent years, driven by tourism and foreign investment, which has pushed up prices.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a more complex economy, with a larger industrial sector and a more developed manufacturing base. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including high unemployment and a large informal economy. Montenegro, on the other hand, has a more service-based economy, with a strong focus on tourism and financial services. This has led to a more rapid increase in prices, particularly in the coastal areas. Overall, Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally cheaper than Montenegro, with an overall cost of living that is approximately 15-20% lower.
