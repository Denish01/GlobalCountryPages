[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been steadily declining over the past few decades, due to a combination of low fertility rates, high emigration rates, and an aging population. The country's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, and its growth rate is one of the lowest in the region. The urban population is approximately 49%, with the majority of people living in cities such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, and Mostar. The population density is relatively low, with an average of 66 people per square kilometer.

The country's population has been affected by migration patterns, with many young people leaving the country in search of better economic opportunities. This has resulted in a significant brain drain, as well as a decline in the working-age population. The government has implemented various policies to try to stem the flow of emigration, including investments in education and job creation programs. However, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of population growth and development.

Despite these challenges, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich cultural heritage and a diverse population, with a mix of urban and rural communities. The country's population is spread across a range of geographic regions, from the mountains of the north to the coastal regions of the south. This diversity has contributed to the country's unique cultural identity and has helped to shape its history and traditions.
