[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]
- Consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October) to avoid peak tourist prices.
- Eat at local restaurants and try traditional dishes like cevapi and burek, which are often cheaper and more delicious than Western-style restaurants.
- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to save on taxi fares.
- Shop at local markets or supermarkets for groceries and souvenirs, rather than touristy areas.
- Learn some basic Bosnian phrases, such as "merhaba" (hello) and "hvala" (thank you), to show respect and get better prices from locals.
- Avoid exchanging money at airports or tourist areas, where rates are often unfavorable – instead, use ATMs or exchange offices in cities.
