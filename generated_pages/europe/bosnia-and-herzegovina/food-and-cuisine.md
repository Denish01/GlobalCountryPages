[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Bosnia and Herzegovina's cuisine is heavily influenced by its geographic location, with the country's mountainous terrain and fertile valleys providing an abundance of fresh produce, meat, and dairy products. The country's culinary traditions have been shaped by its history, with the Ottoman Empire's legacy evident in the use of spices, herbs, and cooking techniques. Regional variations are also significant, with the north and west of the country being more influenced by European cuisine, while the south and east show more Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors. The country's cuisine is also characterized by its hearty and comforting dishes, often made with locally-sourced ingredients and slow-cooked to perfection.

The country's cuisine is also defined by its social and cultural context, with mealtimes often being seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen family and community bonds. The traditional Bosnian **Kafenija**, or coffeehouse, is an important institution, where people gather to socialize, drink coffee, and enjoy sweet and savory pastries. The country's cuisine is also closely tied to its religious heritage, with many dishes being prepared and consumed during special occasions and holidays, such as **Ramadan** and **Christmas**.

Bosnia and Herzegovina's cuisine has also been influenced by its neighbors, with **Croatian** and **Serbian** dishes being popular in certain regions. However, the country's unique cultural and culinary identity is evident in its use of local ingredients, spices, and cooking techniques, which set its cuisine apart from its neighbors. From the **Neretva** valley's citrus groves to the **Dinaric Alps**' rugged terrain, the country's diverse landscape and climate have given rise to a wide range of local specialties and ingredients.
