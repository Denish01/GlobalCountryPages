Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month deposit required, which is usually returned at the end of the lease if the property is in good condition. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with laws governing rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Bosnia and Herzegovina's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Croatia but higher than in Serbia. The country's housing market is also influenced by its complex administrative structure, with different laws and regulations applying in different regions.\n\nThe housing market in Bosnia and Herzegovina is also affected by the country's history and economy. Many buildings were damaged or destroyed during the war in the 1990s, and while significant progress has been made in rebuilding and renovating properties, there is still a shortage of high-quality housing, particularly in urban areas. As a result, prices for apartments and houses in desirable locations can be relatively high, while prices in less desirable areas can be lower. Additionally, the country's economy is still developing, which can make it challenging for some people to afford housing, particularly in the formal sector.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $80-$200 | small, basic apartments |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $100-$250 | typical quality, 40-60 sqm |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$600 | $150-$350 | family size, 60-90 sqm |\n| 3 Bedroom | $450-$900 | $250-$550 | spacious, 90-120 sqm |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, older buildings |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | countryside, traditional houses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Baščaršija**: historic neighborhood in Sarajevo, with narrow streets and old buildings, rent range $200-$500 USD (350-875 BAM) per month\n- **Centar**: modern neighborhood in Sarajevo, with high-rise buildings and amenities, rent range $250-$600 USD (435-1,050 BAM) per month\n- **Kovači**: upscale neighborhood in Sarajevo, with beautiful views and modern homes, rent range $300-$800 USD (525-1,400 BAM) per month\n- **Ilidža**: suburb of Sarajevo, with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $150-$350 USD (260-600 BAM) per month\n- **Vijećnica**: historic neighborhood in Sarajevo, with beautiful architecture and cultural attractions, rent range $200-$500 USD (350-875 BAM) per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Bosnia and Herzegovina [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your housing search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable apartment\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease\n- Check the condition of the property and ensure it is safe and well-maintained\n- Consider the cost of utilities, which are usually not included in the rent\n- Be aware of scams and always sign a written lease agreement\n- Furnished apartments are less common, so be prepared to purchase or rent furniture if needed\n- Learn some basic **Bosnian** phrases to help with communication and navigation",
