[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a relatively well-developed public transportation system, with buses and trains connecting major cities and towns. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Sarajevo having a more comprehensive network. Most people get around using buses, taxis, or ride-hailing services, as the country's mountainous terrain can make driving challenging. Additionally, many locals walk or cycle in urban areas, taking advantage of the scenic routes and relatively low traffic congestion.

The country's transportation network is also influenced by its geography, with many roads and railways following the valleys and rivers. This can make travel times longer than expected, especially during peak season or in areas with heavy traffic. However, the scenic routes and picturesque landscapes make the journey worthwhile, and many tourists enjoy exploring the country's natural beauty by car or bus.
