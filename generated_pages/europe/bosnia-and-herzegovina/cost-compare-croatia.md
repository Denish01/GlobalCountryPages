[SECTION] Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina vs Croatia [/SECTION]
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia are two neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe, with distinct economic profiles. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy, which translates to lower prices for goods and services.
