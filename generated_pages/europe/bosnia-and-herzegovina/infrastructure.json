  "content": "Bosnia and Herzegovina's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's transportation networks, energy sector, and telecommunications.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 70%\nRoad Network: 22,926 km, moderate quality with some poor conditions\nRail Network: 965 km\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 1, with access to the Adriatic Sea via neighboring Croatia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nBosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure since the 1990s, with a focus on rebuilding and expanding its transportation networks, energy sector, and telecommunications. However, the country still faces challenges in terms of providing equal access to modern infrastructure for both urban and rural areas. Recent investments have been made to upgrade the country's roads, railways, and airports, with a focus on improving connectivity with neighboring countries. Despite these efforts, there is still a notable gap in infrastructure development between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity, clean water, and high-speed internet.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development has been supported by international organizations and foreign investors, who have provided funding and expertise to help modernize the country's infrastructure. This has included investments in the energy sector, with a focus on increasing the use of renewable energy sources and improving the efficiency of the country's power grid. Additionally, efforts have been made to upgrade the country's telecommunications infrastructure, with a focus on expanding access to high-speed internet and mobile phone coverage.\n\nOverall, while Bosnia and Herzegovina still faces significant challenges in terms of its infrastructure development, the country has made notable progress in recent years and is continuing to invest in modernizing its systems. This is expected to have a positive impact on the country's economy and quality of life for its citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 22,926 km | Moderate | Some roads are in poor condition, particularly in rural areas |\n| Railways | 965 km | Good | Rail network is relatively well-maintained, but limited in scope |\n| Airports | 4 international, 2 domestic | Good | Major airports are well-equipped, but smaller airports may have limited facilities |\n| Ports | 1 major | Good | The port of Ploče is a major hub for trade and commerce, but is located in neighboring Croatia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The country's power generation is primarily based on **coal** and **hydroelectric** sources, with some **natural gas** and **renewable energy** sources also being used.\n- The reliability of the power grid is generally good, but **outages** can occur during periods of high demand or in areas with aging infrastructure.\n- Efforts are being made to increase the use of **renewable energy** sources, such as **solar** and **wind power**, with a goal of reducing the country's dependence on fossil fuels.\n- The country's energy sector is regulated by the **State Electricity Regulatory Commission**, which oversees the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity.\n- Bosnia and Herzegovina is also a part of the **European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity**, which helps to coordinate the country's energy policies with those of its European neighbors.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally considered safe to drink in urban areas, but may not be safe in rural areas due to aging infrastructure and limited treatment facilities.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with around 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas can be limited, with some communities relying on wells or other non-piped sources of water.\n- Efforts are being made to upgrade the country's **water treatment** facilities and improve access to clean water and sanitation in rural areas.\n- The country's **water resources** are relatively abundant, with many rivers and lakes providing opportunities for **hydroelectric power** generation and other uses.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile phone coverage** is relatively high, with around 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic** and **broadband** internet services are available in many urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **4G** and **5G** mobile networks are being rolled out in the country, with several major operators offering high-speed mobile internet services.\n- The country's **postal services** are provided by the **Bosnia and Herzegovina Post**, which offers a range of services including mail delivery, package shipping, and financial services.\n- Efforts are being made to increase access to **high-speed internet** and other telecommunications services in rural areas, with a focus on supporting economic development and improving quality of life.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Trans-European Transport Networks** (TEN-T) project is a major initiative aimed at upgrading the country's transportation infrastructure, including its roads, railways, and airports.\n- The **European Union** (EU) is providing funding and support for several infrastructure development projects in the country, including the construction of new roads and the upgrading of existing energy infrastructure.\n- The **World Bank** is also providing funding and support for several infrastructure development projects in the country, including the development of new water and sanitation facilities and the upgrading of existing telecommunications infrastructure.\n- The country is also investing in the development of its **tourism** infrastructure, with a focus on supporting the growth of the tourism industry and improving the overall quality of life for citizens and visitors.\n- The **Reconstruction and Development Program** is a major initiative aimed at supporting the country's post-war reconstruction and development, with a focus on infrastructure development, economic growth, and social welfare.",
