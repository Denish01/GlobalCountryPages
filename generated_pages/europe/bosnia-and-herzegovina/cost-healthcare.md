[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, but it is still accessible to all citizens and foreigners with health insurance. Locals typically use the public healthcare system, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare due to language barriers and perceived higher quality of care. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and health insurance contributions, while private healthcare is largely paid out-of-pocket or through private health insurance.

The healthcare system in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be complex and bureaucratic, with long waiting times for non-emergency procedures in the public sector. However, private healthcare providers offer a range of services, including specialist consultations, diagnostic tests, and surgical procedures, often with shorter waiting times and more modern facilities. It is recommended that foreigners and expats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of private healthcare can be high.
