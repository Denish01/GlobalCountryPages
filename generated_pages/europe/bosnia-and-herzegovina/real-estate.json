The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a strong demand for modern apartments and offices in urban areas. The price trajectory has been steadily increasing, with a growth rate of around 5-10% per year. Urban areas, such as Sarajevo and Mostar, are more expensive than rural areas, where prices are generally lower.\n\nThe market is also influenced by the country's complex administrative system, with three main ethnic groups - Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs - having their own separate entities and regulations. This can create challenges for foreign investors, but also opportunities for those who are willing to navigate the system. The government has been working to simplify the process of buying and owning property, and to attract more foreign investment.\n\nThe rental market is also growing, with a high demand for short-term rentals in tourist areas and long-term rentals in urban centers. The yield on rental properties is around 5-7%, which is relatively high compared to other European countries. However, the market is still relatively undeveloped, and there are opportunities for investors to capitalize on the growing demand for high-quality rental properties.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sarajevo | 1,200 | 200-500 | Apartment |\n| Mostar | 800 | 150-300 | Apartment |\n| Banja Luka | 600 | 100-200 | Apartment |\n| Tuzla | 400 | 80-150 | House |\n| Brcko | 300 | 60-120 | House |\n| Trebinje | 250 | 50-100 | House |\n| Zenica | 200 | 40-80 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but they need to obtain a **permit** from the relevant authorities.\n- The permit is usually granted for a specific period, and it can be renewed.\n- Foreigners can also set up a **company** in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which can own property without the need for a permit.\n- However, the company needs to be registered and meet certain requirements, such as having a minimum amount of capital.\n- Foreigners can also lease property for a long period, typically 99 years, which can be a **leasehold** arrangement.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1. **Research** the market and find a property that meets your needs and budget.\n2. **Appoint** a real estate agent or lawyer to assist with the process.\n3. **View** the property and negotiate the price.\n4. **Sign** a **preliminary agreement** with the seller.\n5. **Conduct** a **due diligence** on the property, including checking the ownership and any outstanding debts.\n6. **Obtain** a **permit** from the relevant authorities, if required.\n7. **Sign** the **final agreement** and transfer the ownership.\n8. **Register** the property with the relevant authorities.\n9. **Pay** the **property tax** and any other fees.\n10. **Obtain** a **certificate of ownership** from the relevant authorities.\n\n[SECTION] Rental Market [/SECTION]\n- The rental market in Bosnia and Herzegovina is growing, with a high demand for short-term rentals in tourist areas.\n- The **tenant rights** are protected by law, and tenants have the right to a written contract and a minimum notice period.\n- The **typical lease terms** are 6-12 months, but they can be longer or shorter depending on the agreement.\n- The **deposit** is usually one or two months' rent, and it is refundable at the end of the lease.\n- The **furnished** or **unfurnished** status of the property can affect the rent, with furnished properties typically commanding a higher rent.\n\n[SECTION] Investment Tips [/SECTION]\n- **Emerging areas**, such as Sarajevo and Mostar, offer opportunities for high returns on investment.\n- **Risks**, such as the complex administrative system and the potential for **property disputes**, need to be carefully managed.\n- **Legal considerations**, such as the need for a permit and the registration of the property, need to be carefully considered.\n- **Property management** is crucial, and investors need to ensure that they have a reliable and trustworthy property manager.\n- **Research** and **due diligence** are essential, and investors need to carefully research the market and the property before making a decision.\n- **Diversification** is key, and investors should consider diversifying their portfolio by investing in different types of properties and locations.",
