Bosnia and Herzegovina has a complex and diverse history that spans from ancient times to the present day, with various empires, kingdoms, and rulers shaping the country's development.

The history of Bosnia and Herzegovina began with the arrival of the **Illyrians** in the 8th century BC, who established a number of tribes and kingdoms in the region.
