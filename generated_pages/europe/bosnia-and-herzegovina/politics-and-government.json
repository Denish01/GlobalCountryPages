The system is based on the Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the Bosnian War in 1995. The country is divided into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska, each with its own government and parliament. The federal government is responsible for foreign policy, defense, and other national matters, while the entities have significant autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic policy. The system of government is designed to ensure representation and protection of the rights of all three ethnic groups, but it has been criticized for being cumbersome and inefficient.\n\nThe separation of powers in Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the principles of **checks and balances**, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **Parliamentary Assembly** is the legislative branch, composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the House of Peoples. The **Council of Ministers** is the executive branch, headed by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The **Constitutional Court** is the highest judicial authority, responsible for interpreting the constitution and ensuring that laws and government actions are in line with it.\n\nThe federal system of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina is designed to balance the interests of the country's two entities and the federal government. The **Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina** and the **Republika Srpska** each have their own governments and parliaments, with significant autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic policy. The federal government, on the other hand, is responsible for national matters such as foreign policy, defense, and justice.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Zoran Tegeltija) | Head of government, responsible for national policy and administration |\n| Legislative | Parliamentary Assembly | Speaker of the House of Representatives (Denis Zvizdić) | Lawmaking and oversight of the executive branch |\n| Judicial | Constitutional Court | President of the Constitutional Court (Valerija Galić) | Interpretation of the constitution and ensuring rule of law |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Party of Democratic Action (SDA) | Center-left, Bosniak nationalist | Bakir Izetbegović | 9 | Largest party in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina |\n| Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) | Center-right, Serb nationalist | Milorad Dodik | 6 | Largest party in the Republika Srpska |\n| Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) | Center-right, Croat nationalist | Dragan Čović | 5 | Largest Croat party in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina |\n| Social Democratic Party (SDP) | Center-left, multi-ethnic | Nermin Nikšić | 4 | Largest multi-ethnic party in the country |\n| Democratic Front (DF) | Center-left, multi-ethnic | Željko Komšić | 3 | Liberal, pro-European party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on **proportional representation**, with voters electing representatives to the Parliamentary Assembly and the entities' parliaments.\n- Elections are held every four years, with the last general election taking place in 2022.\n- The next general election is scheduled for 2026.\n- Voter participation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally high, with around 50-60% of eligible voters casting their ballots in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Bosnia and Herzegovina is characterized by **tensions between the three main ethnic groups**, with ongoing debates over issues such as constitutional reform and the distribution of power between the federal government and the entities.\n- Key issues facing the country include **economic stagnation**, **corruption**, and **brain drain**, as many young and educated Bosnians leave the country in search of better opportunities abroad.\n- Regional dynamics, including the influence of neighboring countries such as Croatia and Serbia, also play a significant role in Bosnia and Herzegovina's politics.\n- The country's **freedom indices** are generally positive, with Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked as \"partly free\" by Freedom House and 63rd out of 180 countries in the 2022 World Press Freedom Index.\n- The country's **human development index** is also relatively high, with Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked 75th out of 189 countries in the 2022 Human Development Index.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Bosnia and Herzegovina is a member of several **international organizations**, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n- The country has applied for membership in the **European Union** and is currently a candidate country, with negotiations ongoing since 2016.\n- Bosnia and Herzegovina also has a **stabilization and association agreement** with the EU, which aims to promote economic and political cooperation between the two sides.\n- The country's diplomatic stance is generally **pro-European** and **pro-Western**, with a focus on integrating into European and Atlantic structures.\n- Bosnia and Herzegovina also maintains good relations with its **regional neighbors**, including Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro, although historical and ethnic tensions continue to influence regional dynamics.",
