[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country located in southeastern Europe, situated in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula. It is bordered by three countries: Croatia to the north, west, and south, Serbia to the east, and Montenegro to the southeast. The country has a short coastline along the Adriatic Sea, which is approximately 20 kilometers long. This strategic location has made Bosnia and Herzegovina an important crossroads between Eastern and Western Europe throughout history.

The country's borders are mountainous and rugged, with many peaks reaching elevations of over 2,000 meters. The Dinaric Alps, a mountain range that stretches along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, covers much of western Bosnia and Herzegovina. The country's terrain and borders have played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The borders with neighboring countries have been a source of both cooperation and conflict, with the country's unique cultural and geographical position making it an important player in regional politics.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with a diverse and complex terrain, featuring a mix of mountains, rivers, forests, and coastal areas. The Dinaric Alps, which cover much of the country, are a dominant feature of the landscape. The highest peak, Maglić, is located in the southern part of the country, near the border with Montenegro. The mountains are covered with dense forests, which are home to a wide range of flora and fauna. The country's rivers, including the Sava, Bosna, and Neretva, flow through the valleys and plains, providing water and fertile soil for agriculture.

The country's coastline, although short, is an important feature of the landscape. The Adriatic Sea has played a significant role in the country's history, with many coastal towns and cities, such as Neum and Mostar, developing as important trading centers. The coastal area is also known for its beautiful beaches and clear waters, making it a popular destination for tourists. In addition to the coastline, the country has a number of lakes, including the famous **Bijela** and **Boračko** lakes, which are popular for fishing and boating.

The terrain and landscape of Bosnia and Herzegovina have also been shaped by the country's geological history. The country is located in a seismically active region, with many earthquakes occurring throughout history. The terrain is also characterized by many caves, canyons, and other karst features, which are a result of the country's limestone geology. These unique features have made Bosnia and Herzegovina a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with many opportunities for hiking, climbing, and exploring.
