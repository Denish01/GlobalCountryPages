[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Bosnia and Herzegovina is relatively stable, with a mix of old and new buildings, including apartments and houses. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month deposit required, which is usually returned at the end of the lease if the property is in good condition. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with laws governing rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Bosnia and Herzegovina's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Croatia but higher than in Serbia. The country's housing market is also influenced by its complex administrative structure, with different laws and regulations applying in different regions.

The housing market in Bosnia and Herzegovina is also affected by the country's history and economy. Many buildings were damaged or destroyed during the war in the 1990s, and while significant progress has been made in rebuilding and renovating properties, there is still a shortage of high-quality housing, particularly in urban areas. As a result, prices for apartments and houses in desirable locations can be relatively high, while prices in less desirable areas can be lower. Additionally, the country's economy is still developing, which can make it challenging for some people to afford housing, particularly in the formal sector.
