The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Sarajevo having a more comprehensive network. Most people get around using buses, taxis, or ride-hailing services, as the country's mountainous terrain can make driving challenging. Additionally, many locals walk or cycle in urban areas, taking advantage of the scenic routes and relatively low traffic congestion.\n\nThe country's transportation network is also influenced by its geography, with many roads and railways following the valleys and rivers. This can make travel times longer than expected, especially during peak season or in areas with heavy traffic. However, the scenic routes and picturesque landscapes make the journey worthwhile, and many tourists enjoy exploring the country's natural beauty by car or bus.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Good coverage in Sarajevo, limited in smaller towns |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | $2.00-$5.00 | $50-$70 | Limited routes, mostly connecting major cities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Be sure to use licensed taxis |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.00 | $0.30 | $3-$6 | Bolt and FlixBus available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Sarajevo city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-$50 | Economy car, prices vary depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in city centers |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Some highways have tolls, prices vary |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Frequent departures, prices vary depending on operator |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Limited routes, mostly connecting Sarajevo to other major cities |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly connecting major cities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use public transportation or walk whenever possible to save money and experience the local culture.\n- Download ride-hailing apps like Bolt or FlixBus for convenient and affordable transportation.\n- Be sure to negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, especially for longer trips.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or to explore rural areas, but be aware of the country's challenging roads and limited parking options.\n- Use online resources or ask locals for information on bus schedules and routes, as they can be limited in smaller towns.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.",
