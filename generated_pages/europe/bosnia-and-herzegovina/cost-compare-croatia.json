Bosnia and Herzegovina has a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy, which translates to lower prices for goods and services. In contrast, Croatia has a more developed economy and a stronger tourism industry, which drives up prices, particularly in popular destinations like Dubrovnik and Split. Overall, Bosnia and Herzegovina offers a more affordable cost of living, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in shaping their cost of living. Bosnia and Herzegovina is still recovering from the devastating war of the 1990s, and its economy is largely driven by manufacturing and agriculture. Croatia, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, services, and industry. As a result, Croatia has a higher standard of living and a more developed infrastructure, but also higher prices. For expats, students, and retirees, Bosnia and Herzegovina offers a more affordable and welcoming environment, with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bosnia and Herzegovina (USD) | Croatia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $250 | $400 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $700 | 42.9% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bosnia and Herzegovina (USD) | Croatia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $10 | $15 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $200 | $300 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1.50 | $2.50 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bosnia and Herzegovina (USD) | Croatia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $0.80 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1.50 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bosnia and Herzegovina (USD) | Croatia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $100 | $150 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $15 | 33.3% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Bosnia and Herzegovina (USD) | Croatia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $600 | $900 | 33.3% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,500 | 33.3% |\n| Comfortable | $1,500 | $2,500 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Bosnia and Herzegovina is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing\n  - Food and dining\n  - Transportation\n  - Utilities and internet\n- **Croatia is cheaper for:**\n  - Healthcare and medical services\n  - Education and childcare\n  - Tourist attractions and activities\n  - High-end shopping and luxury goods\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Bosnia and Herzegovina offers a more affordable and welcoming environment, with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.
