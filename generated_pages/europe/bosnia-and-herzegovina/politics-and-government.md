[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is characterized by a complex system of power-sharing and representation, which is designed to balance the interests of the country's three main ethnic groups: Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs. The system is based on the Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the Bosnian War in 1995. The country is divided into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska, each with its own government and parliament. The federal government is responsible for foreign policy, defense, and other national matters, while the entities have significant autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic policy. The system of government is designed to ensure representation and protection of the rights of all three ethnic groups, but it has been criticized for being cumbersome and inefficient.

The separation of powers in Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the principles of **checks and balances**, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **Parliamentary Assembly** is the legislative branch, composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the House of Peoples. The **Council of Ministers** is the executive branch, headed by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The **Constitutional Court** is the highest judicial authority, responsible for interpreting the constitution and ensuring that laws and government actions are in line with it.

The federal system of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina is designed to balance the interests of the country's two entities and the federal government. The **Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina** and the **Republika Srpska** each have their own governments and parliaments, with significant autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic policy. The federal government, on the other hand, is responsible for national matters such as foreign policy, defense, and justice.
