In the 1st century BC, the **Roman Empire** conquered the area, and it became a Roman province.

In the 7th century, the **Slavs** arrived in the region, and they established a number of medieval kingdoms, including the **Kingdom of Bosnia**, which emerged in the 12th century. The kingdom was eventually conquered by the **Ottoman Empire** in the 15th century, and it remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 400 years. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Bosnia and Herzegovina became a **protectorate** of **Austria-Hungary**, and it was eventually annexed by the empire in 1908.
