[/SECTION]\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a relatively affordable country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is lower than many Western European countries. Compared to its neighbors, Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally cheaper than Croatia, but more expensive than Serbia and Montenegro. The country's economy is still recovering from the devastating war in the 1990s, which has kept prices relatively low. However, as tourism increases, prices are slowly rising, especially in popular areas like Sarajevo and Mostar. Overall, Bosnia and Herzegovina offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expats.\n\nThe cost of living in Bosnia and Herzegovina can vary depending on the location, with cities like Sarajevo and Banja Luka tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. However, even in the cities, prices are generally lower than in Western Europe, making it possible to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle without breaking the bank. With a little planning and research, visitors and residents can take advantage of the country's affordability and enjoy all that Bosnia and Herzegovina has to offer.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $10-20 | basic dorms and private rooms, often with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $40-80 | comfortable rooms with private bathrooms, often with breakfast included |\n| Luxury/Resort | $150-300 | high-end hotels and resorts, often with amenities like pools and spas |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $200-500 | city center: $300-500, outside city center: $200-300 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-20 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-40 |\n| Fine Dining | $50-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $2-5 |\n| Coffee | $1-3 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-2 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $50-100 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| Food | 300 | 500 | 800 |\n| Transport | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 150 | 250 |\n| Entertainment | 100 | 200 | 400 |\n| **Total** | **750** | **1350** | **2250** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October) to avoid peak tourist prices.\n- Eat at local restaurants and try traditional dishes like cevapi and burek, which are often cheaper and more delicious than Western-style restaurants.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to save on taxi fares.\n- Shop at local markets or supermarkets for groceries and souvenirs, rather than touristy areas.\n- Learn some basic Bosnian phrases, such as \"merhaba\" (hello) and \"hvala\" (thank you), to show respect and get better prices from locals.\n- Avoid exchanging money at airports or tourist areas, where rates are often unfavorable – instead, use ATMs or exchange offices in cities.",
