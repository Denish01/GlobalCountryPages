        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina has an upper-middle-income economy, with a mix of industry, agriculture, and services. The country's economy is still recovering from the devastating war in the 1990s, which led to significant damage to infrastructure and a decline in economic activity. However, in recent years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress in rebuilding its economy, with a focus on developing its manufacturing and services sectors. The country's strategic location in the Balkans, at the crossroads of Europe, makes it an attractive location for trade and investment.</p>
        <p>The economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is characterized by a large public sector, a significant informal economy, and a high level of unemployment. The country's economic development has been hindered by a complex and bureaucratic system, as well as a lack of investment in key sectors such as infrastructure and education. However, the government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the business environment, increasing foreign investment, and promoting economic growth.</p>
        <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina's economy is also heavily dependent on foreign aid and remittances from abroad. The country has received significant financial support from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU), which has helped to stabilize the economy and promote economic growth. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a large trade deficit, a high level of debt, and a need for further reforms to improve the business environment and promote economic development.</p>
