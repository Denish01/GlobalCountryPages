[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Belgian property market is characterized by a mix of urban and rural areas, with a strong demand for housing in cities like Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent. The market has experienced a steady growth in recent years, driven by a stable economy, low interest rates, and a high standard of living. However, the market is also subject to fluctuations, and prices can vary significantly depending on the location, type of property, and other factors. In general, urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, with prices in cities like Brussels and Antwerp being among the highest in the country.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from apartments to houses, and a relatively low **property tax**. The **rental yield** is also attractive, making Belgium a popular destination for investors. However, the market is highly competitive, and buyers need to be prepared to act quickly when they find a property that meets their needs. The price trajectory is generally upward, with prices increasing by around 2-3% per year, although this can vary depending on the location and type of property.

In terms of trends, there is a growing demand for **sustainable** and **energy-efficient** properties, as well as a increasing interest in **co-living** and **co-working** spaces. This is driven by a growing awareness of environmental issues and a desire for more flexible and communal living and working arrangements. As a result, properties that incorporate these features are likely to be in high demand and may command a premium price.
