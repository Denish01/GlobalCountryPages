[SECTION] How Belgium Is Divided [/SECTION]
Belgium is a federal state divided into three regions: the Flemish Region, the Walloon Region, and the Brussels-Capital Region. The country is further subdivided into 10 provinces, with each region comprising a number of provinces. The Flemish Region consists of the provinces of West Flanders, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant, and Antwerp, while the Walloon Region comprises the provinces of Hainaut, Walloon Brabant, Namur, Luxembourg, and Liège. The Brussels-Capital Region is a separate entity that encompasses the capital city of Brussels and its surrounding municipalities.

The division of Belgium into regions and provinces reflects the country's linguistic and cultural diversity. The Flemish Region is predominantly Dutch-speaking, while the Walloon Region is predominantly French-speaking. The Brussels-Capital Region is bilingual, with both Dutch and French being official languages. This division also has implications for the country's governance and administration, with each region having a significant degree of autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic development.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Belgium has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and roads connecting the major cities and regions. The country's rail network is particularly extensive, with frequent train services linking Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and other major cities. The bus network is also well-developed, with buses connecting smaller towns and villages to the larger cities. Driving in Belgium is relatively easy, with well-maintained roads and a comprehensive network of highways and motorways. However, traffic congestion can be a problem in the larger cities, particularly during rush hour.

Domestic flights are also available, although they are not as frequent as train or bus services. The main airports in Belgium are Brussels Airport, Antwerp International Airport, and Ostend-Bruges International Airport. Taxis and ride-hailing services are widely available in the larger cities, although they can be more expensive than public transportation. Cycling is also a popular mode of transportation in Belgium, particularly in the larger cities, with many bike lanes and bike-sharing schemes available.
