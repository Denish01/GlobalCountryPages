  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Belgium varies depending on the type of service and provider, with public healthcare generally being more affordable than private healthcare, and insurance costs ranging from $200 to $500 per month for basic to comprehensive coverage.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $4,911 (based on GDP per capita PPP of $73,514)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 21.5% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed (Universal and Private)\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nBelgium has a mixed healthcare system, combining elements of universal and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality and widely available, but waiting times can be long for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers faster access to specialized care and more luxurious facilities, but at a higher cost. For locals, the healthcare system is generally easy to navigate, with most people having access to a family doctor and specialist care through their health insurance. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is recommended to have private health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Belgium is generally well-regarded, with a strong emphasis on preventative care and a wide range of specialized services available. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, with private hospitals and clinics often offering more luxurious facilities and faster access to specialized care. In general, it is recommended that foreigners and expats have private health insurance to ensure access to the best possible care, although this can be more expensive than relying on the public healthcare system.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$50 | $100-$250 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $200-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $300-$500 | Specialist care, private hospital stays, advanced procedures |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, comprehensive care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $5-$20 per prescription, depending on the type and quantity of medication.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and generally affordable, with prices ranging from $5-$10 per item.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas.\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with most medication requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Some medication may be subsidized by the government, reducing the cost to patients.\n- It is generally recommended to have a prescription from a Belgian doctor to ensure that medication is covered by insurance.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112, which will connect you with emergency services.
