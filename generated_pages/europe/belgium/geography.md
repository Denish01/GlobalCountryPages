[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Belgium is a sovereign country located in Western Europe, bordered by several countries and a major body of water. To the west, it is bordered by the North Sea, which provides a significant coastline for the country. Belgium shares its land borders with four countries: France to the southwest, Germany to the east, Luxembourg to the southeast, and the Netherlands to the north. This unique location makes Belgium an important hub for trade and culture in the region. The country's proximity to the sea and its borders with several major European powers have played a significant role in shaping its history and identity.

Belgium's location also makes it easily accessible by land, sea, or air, with several major transportation hubs, including the Port of Antwerp and Brussels Airport. The country's borders are relatively small, but they are densely populated, with several major cities, including Brussels, Antwerp, and Bruges, located near the borders. The country's unique cultural and linguistic diversity is also reflected in its border regions, with different languages and dialects spoken in different parts of the country. For example, the border region with France is predominantly French-speaking, while the border region with the Netherlands is predominantly Dutch-speaking.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Belgium's terrain is generally flat, with some hills and valleys in the eastern part of the country. The country can be divided into three main regions: the coastal plain, the central plain, and the Ardennes. The coastal plain is a narrow strip of land along the North Sea, with several beaches, dunes, and coastal towns. The central plain is a flat, fertile region that covers most of the country, with several major rivers, including the Scheldt and the Meuse. The Ardennes is a hilly, forested region in the eastern part of the country, with several major rivers, including the Ourthe and the Amblève.

The Ardennes region is also home to several major natural attractions, including the **Hautes Fagnes** nature reserve and the **Ardennes Forest**. The region is popular for hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities, with several major trails, including the GR 5 and the GR 57. The central plain is also home to several major cities, including Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent, with several major cultural and historical attractions, including the **Grand Place** in Brussels and the **Gravensteen** in Ghent.

The country's terrain has played a significant role in shaping its history and economy, with the coastal plain and the central plain being major centers for trade and industry. The Ardennes region, on the other hand, has been an important center for forestry and agriculture, with several major farms and forests located in the region. The country's terrain has also been influenced by its geological history, with several major glaciers and rivers shaping the landscape over millions of years.
