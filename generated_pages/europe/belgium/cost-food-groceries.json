However, food prices in Belgium are slightly higher than the regional average, driven by factors such as high labor costs, taxes, and transportation expenses. The country's eating-out culture is vibrant, with many restaurants, cafes, and bars offering a wide range of options, from traditional Belgian cuisine to international flavors. On the other hand, home cooking is also popular, with many Belgians preferring to prepare meals at home using fresh ingredients from local markets or supermarkets.\n\nThe cost of food in Belgium is influenced by the country's geographic location, with proximity to the North Sea and major transportation hubs making it an important hub for food imports and exports. Additionally, the country's high standard of living and strong economy contribute to higher food prices. Despite this, there are many affordable options for eating out and grocery shopping, making it possible to enjoy Belgian cuisine without breaking the bank. For example, **street food** and **local eateries** offer a range of affordable options, while **supermarkets** and **discount stores** provide competitive prices for groceries.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50-$2.50 | 1.30-2.20 EUR | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.50-$3.50 | 2.20-3.10 EUR | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00-$3.00 | 1.80-2.70 EUR | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 1.30-2.20 EUR | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8.00-$12.00 | 7.00-10.50 EUR | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $15.00-$25.00 | 13.00-22.00 EUR | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50-$3.50 | 2.20-3.10 EUR | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00-$3.00 | 1.80-2.70 EUR | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 1.30-2.20 EUR | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 0.90-1.80 EUR | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10.00-$15.00 | 8.80-13.20 EUR | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00-$2.00 | 0.90-1.80 EUR | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | (typical dishes like waffles, fries, or sandwiches) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$30 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | (3 courses, including wine or beer) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$120 | (upscale, 5-7 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to grocery shopping, Belgians have the option to choose between **supermarkets** and **local markets**.
