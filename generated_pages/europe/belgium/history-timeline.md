# Belgium History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Belgium is a complex and multifaceted narrative that spans over two thousand years, from the earliest known Celtic tribes to the modern-day federal state. 

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The earliest known history of Belgium dates back to the **Celtic era**, when the region was inhabited by various Celtic tribes, including the **Menapii** and the **Nervii**. The Romans later conquered the region, and it became a part of the **Roman Empire**. With the decline of the Roman Empire, the region was invaded by various Germanic tribes, including the **Franks**, who established the **Merovingian dynasty**. The region was later divided into several smaller states, including the **Duchy of Burgundy** and the **County of Flanders**. In the 16th century, the region was unified under the **Habsburgs**, who ruled over a vast territory that included present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and parts of France and Germany.

During the **Eighty Years' War**, the region was divided into two main parts: the **Spanish Netherlands** and the **Dutch Republic**. The Spanish Netherlands, which included present-day Belgium, remained under Spanish rule until the 18th century, when it was conquered by the **Austrians**. The region was later occupied by **French** forces during the **French Revolutionary Wars**, and it became a part of the **French Empire** under **Napoleon Bonaparte**. After the defeat of Napoleon, the region was unified with the **Kingdom of the Netherlands**, but it eventually gained independence in 1830, following the **Belgian Revolution**.

The 19th and 20th centuries saw significant economic and industrial development in Belgium, with the country becoming a major center for **textile production** and **coal mining**. However, the country was also affected by two major wars: **World War I** and **World War II**. During World War I, Belgium was invaded by **Germany**, and the country suffered significant damage and loss of life. During World War II, Belgium was again invaded by Germany, and the country was occupied for four years. After the war, Belgium became a founding member of the **European Economic Community**, the precursor to the **European Union**.

In recent years, Belgium has continued to develop as a federal state, with significant devolution of power to the regions. The country has also become a major center for **European politics** and **international relations**, with the **European Commission** and the **NATO** headquarters located in Brussels. Today, Belgium is a **sovereign state** with a population of over 11 million people, and it continues to play an important role in European and international affairs.

[SECTION] Founding & Formation [/SECTION]
The founding of Belgium as a modern state dates back to the **Belgian Revolution** of 1830, when the region gained independence from the Netherlands.

The first king of Belgium was **Leopold I**, who was crowned in 1831 and played a key role in establishing the country's institutions and government. The **Belgian Constitution**, which was adopted in 1831, established the country as a **federal state** with a **bicameral parliament** and a **judicial system**.

The formation of Belgium as a modern state was also influenced by the **Congress of Vienna**, which took place in 1815 and redrew the map of Europe following the defeat of Napoleon. The congress established the **Kingdom of the Netherlands**, which included present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and parts of Germany and Luxembourg. However, the Belgian region was not satisfied with the arrangement and sought independence, which was eventually achieved in 1830.

The Congo Free State was eventually annexed by Belgium in 1908, and it became a **Belgian colony**. The colony gained independence in 1960, marking the end of Belgium's colonial era.

The independence movement in the Congo was led by a group of **nationalist** politicians, who sought to establish an **independent state** with a **democratic government**. The movement was influenced by the **African independence movement**, which swept across the continent in the mid-20th century. The first leader of the independent Congo was **Joseph Kasavubu**, who became the country's **president** in 1960.
