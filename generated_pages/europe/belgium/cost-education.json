  "content": "The cost of education in Belgium varies depending on the type of institution and the student's residency status, with public education being generally free or subsidized for local students, while international students and those attending private schools may face higher fees.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 6.3%\nLiteracy Rate: 99%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 10 months\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Belgium is highly regarded and offers a wide range of options for students, including public, private, and international schools. Public education is generally considered to be of high quality and is free or subsidized for local students, with the majority of students attending public schools. The language of instruction is typically Dutch, French, or German, depending on the region, and students are required to attend school for 12 years, from the age of 6 to 18. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more personalized education and may have higher fees, but are still subject to the same curriculum and standards as public schools. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate, and catering to the needs of expat families.\n\nThe quality of education in Belgium is generally considered to be very high, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and a wide range of extracurricular activities. The education system is also highly decentralized, with each region having its own education authority and curriculum, which can make it difficult for students to move between regions. However, this also allows for a high degree of autonomy and flexibility, with schools able to tailor their curricula to meet the needs of their students. Overall, the education system in Belgium offers a wide range of options for students and is highly regarded internationally.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, but may have large class sizes |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Smaller class sizes, more personalized attention |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Wide range of subjects and extracurricular activities |\n| Private Secondary | $5,000-$10,000 | Higher fees, but may offer more specialized programs |\n| International School | $10,000-$20,000 | Offers a range of curricula, including IB, and caters to expat families |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000-$2,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | High-quality education, but may have limited English programs |\n| Private University | $5,000-$10,000 | $10,000-$20,000 | More personalized attention, but higher fees |\n| Top-Ranked University | $10,000-$20,000 | $20,000-$30,000 | Institutions like KU Leuven and Ghent University offer high-quality programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $500-$1,000 | Varies depending on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $50-$100 | Can be expensive, but may be necessary for students struggling in certain subjects |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $200-$500 | Many language schools offer courses in English, French, Dutch, and German |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100-$300 | Varies depending on the school and grade level |\n| School Uniform | $200-$500 | May be required for some private and international schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **International Baccalaureate** program is widely available in Belgium and is a popular choice for expat families.\n- **Scholarships** are available for international students, but may be competitive and have limited availability.\n- **Online learning** options are becoming increasingly popular in Belgium, with many universities and schools offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The **education quality** in Belgium is generally considered to be very high, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and a wide range of extracurricular activities.\n- **Expats** may find it helpful to research schools in advance and plan carefully to ensure a smooth transition for their children.\n- **Language support** is available for students who are not fluent in the language of instruction, but may require additional fees or tutoring.",
