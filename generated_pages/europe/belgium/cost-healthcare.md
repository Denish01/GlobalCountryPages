[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Belgium has a mixed healthcare system, combining elements of universal and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality and widely available, but waiting times can be long for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers faster access to specialized care and more luxurious facilities, but at a higher cost. For locals, the healthcare system is generally easy to navigate, with most people having access to a family doctor and specialist care through their health insurance. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is recommended to have private health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses.

The healthcare system in Belgium is generally well-regarded, with a strong emphasis on preventative care and a wide range of specialized services available. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, with private hospitals and clinics often offering more luxurious facilities and faster access to specialized care. In general, it is recommended that foreigners and expats have private health insurance to ensure access to the best possible care, although this can be more expensive than relying on the public healthcare system.
