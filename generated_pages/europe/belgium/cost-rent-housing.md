[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Belgium is highly competitive, especially in the city centers of Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent. Typical lease terms range from 3 to 12 months, with a standard deposit requirement of 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are well-protected in Belgium, with laws governing rent increases, eviction procedures, and maintenance responsibilities. Compared to its regional neighbors, Belgium's housing costs are relatively high, but still lower than those in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The country's strong economy, high standard of living, and limited housing supply contribute to the relatively high costs of renting and buying property.

The housing market in Belgium is also influenced by the country's linguistic and cultural diversity, with different regions having distinct characteristics and price ranges. For example, the Flemish region tends to have lower housing costs than the Walloon region, while the Brussels-Capital Region has the highest prices due to its status as the capital and a major economic hub. Additionally, the housing market in Belgium is subject to fluctuations in the economy, interest rates, and government policies, which can impact the affordability and availability of housing.
