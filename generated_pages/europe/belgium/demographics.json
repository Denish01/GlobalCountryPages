The country's urban population accounts for about 98% of the total population, with the majority residing in cities such as Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent. The population growth trend in Belgium is characterized by a decline in fertility rates and an increase in life expectancy, resulting in an aging population. Migration patterns also play a significant role in shaping the country's demographics, with many immigrants arriving from neighboring European countries and other parts of the world.\n\nThe urbanization trend in Belgium is driven by the country's strong economy, high standard of living, and excellent education system. Many people move to urban areas in search of better job opportunities, higher education, and a more diverse cultural experience.

The government has implemented policies to manage urbanization and promote sustainable development, including investing in public transportation, renewable energy, and green spaces.\n\nBelgium's population is also characterized by a high level of mobility, with many people commuting to neighboring countries for work or study. The country's strategic location at the heart of Europe makes it an attractive destination for international businesses, students, and tourists.
