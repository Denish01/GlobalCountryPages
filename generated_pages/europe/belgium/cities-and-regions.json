The country is further subdivided into 10 provinces, with each region comprising a number of provinces. The Flemish Region consists of the provinces of West Flanders, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant, and Antwerp, while the Walloon Region comprises the provinces of Hainaut, Walloon Brabant, Namur, Luxembourg, and Liège. The Brussels-Capital Region is a separate entity that encompasses the capital city of Brussels and its surrounding municipalities.\n\nThe division of Belgium into regions and provinces reflects the country's linguistic and cultural diversity. The Flemish Region is predominantly Dutch-speaking, while the Walloon Region is predominantly French-speaking. The Brussels-Capital Region is bilingual, with both Dutch and French being official languages. This division also has implications for the country's governance and administration, with each region having a significant degree of autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic development.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Brussels** (1.2M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic Grand Place, European Union institutions, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: history buffs, business travelers, and foodies\n\n**Antwerp** (520,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, port city\nKnown For: its rich history, fashion scene, and diamond trade\nBest For: fashion enthusiasts, history buffs, and business travelers\n\n**Ghent** (260,000)\nRole: cultural center, university town\nKnown For: its medieval architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and student population\nBest For: students, history buffs, and cultural enthusiasts\n\n**Charleroi** (200,000)\nRole: industrial center, economic hub\nKnown For: its industrial heritage, cultural attractions, and proximity to the French border\nBest For: business travelers, industrial tourists, and those interested in history\n\n**Liège** (200,000)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub, university town\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and student population\nBest For: students, history buffs, and cultural enthusiasts\n\n**Bruges** (118,000)\nRole: tourist center, cultural heritage site\nKnown For: its well-preserved medieval architecture, canals, and historic landmarks\nBest For: tourists, history buffs, and those interested in cultural heritage\n\n**Leuven** (100,000)\nRole: university town, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and student population\nBest For: students, history buffs, and cultural enthusiasts\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Flemish Region | Dutch-speaking, coastal, urban | beaches, ports, fashion | Antwerp |\n| Walloon Region | French-speaking, industrial, rural | coal mining, steel production, countryside | Charleroi |\n| Brussels-Capital Region | bilingual, urban, cosmopolitan | European Union institutions, cultural attractions, historic landmarks | Brussels |\n| West Flanders | coastal, rural, tourist | beaches, medieval towns, countryside | Bruges |\n| East Flanders | rural, industrial, cultural | historic towns, castles, cultural attractions | Ghent |\n| Flemish Brabant | rural, urban, cultural | historic towns, castles, cultural attractions | Leuven |\n| Walloon Brabant | rural, industrial, cultural | coal mining, steel production, countryside | Wavre |\n| Hainaut | industrial, rural, cultural | coal mining, steel production, historic towns | Mons |\n| Luxembourg | rural, natural, tourist | countryside, forests, outdoor activities | Arlon |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The Flemish Region and the Walloon Region have distinct linguistic and cultural identities, with Dutch being the primary language in the former and French in the latter.\n- The Brussels-Capital Region is a bilingual enclave with both Dutch and French being official languages, reflecting its role as the capital of Belgium and the European Union.\n- The economy of the Walloon Region is more industrialized, with a strong focus on coal mining and steel production, while the Flemish Region has a more diversified economy with a strong service sector.\n- The climate in Belgium varies from region to region, with the coastal areas of the Flemish Region experiencing a milder climate than the more inland regions of the Walloon Region.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nBelgium has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and roads connecting the major cities and regions. The country's rail network is particularly extensive, with frequent train services linking Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and other major cities. The bus network is also well-developed, with buses connecting smaller towns and villages to the larger cities. Driving in Belgium is relatively easy, with well-maintained roads and a comprehensive network of highways and motorways. However, traffic congestion can be a problem in the larger cities, particularly during rush hour.\n\nDomestic flights are also available, although they are not as frequent as train or bus services. The main airports in Belgium are Brussels Airport, Antwerp International Airport, and Ostend-Bruges International Airport. Taxis and ride-hailing services are widely available in the larger cities, although they can be more expensive than public transportation. Cycling is also a popular mode of transportation in Belgium, particularly in the larger cities, with many bike lanes and bike-sharing schemes available.
