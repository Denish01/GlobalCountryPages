Brussels Airport is the largest and offers direct flights to many European and international destinations, while Charleroi Airport is a hub for low-cost carriers. You can also enter Belgium by land from its neighboring countries, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, with several major highways and train routes connecting the country to the rest of Europe. The country's strategic location makes it a popular stopover for travelers exploring the continent.\n\nFor those preferring to travel by land, Belgium has a well-developed network of highways and roads, making it easy to enter the country by car or bus. The country is also connected to the European high-speed rail network, with frequent trains arriving from major cities like Paris, Amsterdam, and London. Additionally, several bus companies operate international routes to and from Belgium, offering a more affordable option for travelers on a budget. With its convenient location and extensive transportation network, getting to Belgium is relatively straightforward, whether you're coming from within Europe or from further afield.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nBelgium's domestic air network is limited, with only a few regional airports offering flights within the country. The main domestic airline is Brussels Airlines, which operates flights from Brussels Airport to smaller airports like Ostend-Bruges International Airport and Antwerp International Airport. However, due to the country's small size and well-developed rail network, domestic flights are not a popular mode of transportation for most travelers. If you do need to book a domestic flight, it's best to do so in advance to secure the best prices, with approximate costs ranging from $50 to $200, depending on the route and time of year.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nBelgium has an extensive and efficient rail network, with regular trains connecting major cities like Brussels, Antwerp, and Bruges.

The main bus companies are FlixBus, Eurolines, and De Lijn, which operate a network of routes covering most major cities and towns. Bus travel is generally more affordable than trains, with prices starting from around $5 for short journeys and increasing to $20 or more for longer trips.
