The cost of utilities in Belgium can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased heating demands. The country has a liberalized energy market, which allows consumers to choose from a range of providers, promoting competition and potentially leading to more stable prices. However, the cost of utilities can still vary significantly depending on the region, with cities like Brussels and Antwerp tend to have higher costs than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Belgium is generally high, with a strong focus on sustainability and renewable energy. The country aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and increase its use of renewable energy sources, which can impact the cost of utilities in the long run. For example, some providers offer green energy tariffs, which can be more expensive than traditional tariffs but offer a more sustainable option. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the type of accommodation, with apartments in city centers tend to have higher costs than houses in suburban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | average cost, depending on usage |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | includes waste water and sewage |\n| Gas / Heating | $30 | $50 | $70 | average cost, depending on usage and heating system |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | includes waste collection and recycling |\n| **Total** | **$140** | **$215** | **$280** | average total cost, depending on usage and provider |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-40 | 30-60 Mbps | Telenet, Proximus, Voo |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100-200 Mbps | Telenet, Proximus, Voo |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Orange, Proximus, Telenet |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 5-10 GB | Orange, Proximus, Telenet |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $60-100 | varies | Telenet, Proximus, Voo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $15 | 2 screens, HD |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | individual plan, ad-free |\n| Local Streaming | $10 | VRT, RTBF, and other local providers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Belgium, you will typically need to provide proof of identity and address, as well as a deposit or guarantee.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for those who want to avoid surprise bills, but may not be the most cost-effective option.\n- The best internet providers in Belgium include Telenet, Proximus, and Voo, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and insulating your home.\n- It's also a good idea to regularly review your utility bills and provider to ensure you are getting the best deal, and to consider switching to a different provider if necessary.",
