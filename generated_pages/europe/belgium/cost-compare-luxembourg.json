While both countries have a similar economic context, with a strong focus on services and industry, the cost of living in Luxembourg is generally higher than in Belgium. This is due to Luxembourg's high GDP per capita, which is one of the highest in the world, and its strong financial sector. In contrast, Belgium has a more diverse economy, with a larger manufacturing sector and a lower GDP per capita. As a result, the cost of living in Belgium is around 10-20% lower than in Luxembourg, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Luxembourg has a highly developed financial sector, with many international banks and financial institutions having operations in the country. This has driven up the cost of housing, food, and other living expenses in Luxembourg. In contrast, Belgium has a more balanced economy, with a strong manufacturing sector and a growing services sector. This has helped to keep the cost of living in Belgium relatively lower. Additionally, the inflation rate in both countries is relatively low, with Belgium having a slightly higher inflation rate than Luxembourg. Overall, the cost of living in Belgium is generally lower than in Luxembourg, making it a more affordable option for many people.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belgium (USD) | Luxembourg (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 1,800 | 50% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 800 | 1,200 | 50% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 2,000 | 3,000 | 50% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belgium (USD) | Luxembourg (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 20 | 33% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 600 | 20% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 6 | 20% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| Coffee | 3 | 4 | 33% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belgium (USD) | Luxembourg (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 60 | 20% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 2.50 | 25% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.30 | 8% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belgium (USD) | Luxembourg (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 180 | 20% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 35 | 17% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 25 | 25% more expensive in Luxembourg |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Belgium (USD) | Luxembourg (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 2,000 | 2,500 | 20% savings in Belgium |\n| Mid-Range | 3,000 | 3,800 | 21% savings in Belgium |\n| Comfortable | 4,500 | 5,500 | 18% savings in Belgium |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Belgium is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices around 50% lower than in Luxembourg\n  - Groceries, with prices around 20% lower than in Luxembourg\n  - Transportation, with prices around 20% lower than in Luxembourg\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices around 15% lower than in Luxembourg\n- **Luxembourg is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain types of food, such as meat and dairy products, which are around 10% cheaper than in Belgium\n  - Some types of clothing and accessories, which are around 15% cheaper than in Belgium\n  - Certain types of entertainment, such as movie tickets and museum entrance fees, which are around 10% cheaper than in Belgium\n  - Healthcare, with Luxembourg having a more comprehensive and affordable healthcare system than Belgium\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nBelgium and Luxembourg are both great countries to live in, with a high standard of living and a unique cultural heritage.
