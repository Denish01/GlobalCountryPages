[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Belgium has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. As a member of the European Union and the Schengen Area, Belgium's visa policy is aligned with that of other EU countries. Citizens of over 60 countries can enter Belgium without a visa, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. However, the length of stay and requirements for these visa-free travelers vary depending on their nationality and purpose of visit.

The Belgian government has implemented various measures to facilitate travel to the country while ensuring national security and immigration control. The visa policy is designed to promote tourism, business, and cultural exchange while preventing unauthorized immigration and protecting the rights of Belgian citizens. With its rich history, cultural heritage, and modern infrastructure, Belgium is a popular destination for travelers from around the world.
