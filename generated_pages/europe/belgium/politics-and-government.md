[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Belgian government is characterized by a system of **separation of powers**, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **federal** system of government gives significant autonomy to the country's three regions (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels-Capital) and three communities (Flemish, French, and German-speaking), each with their own governments and parliaments. This complex system is designed to balance the interests of the country's different linguistic and cultural groups.

The **parliamentary** system of government means that the Prime Minister and other ministers are accountable to the Federal Parliament, which is composed of two chambers: the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. The **constitutional monarchy** provides a symbolic head of state, with the King playing a largely ceremonial role. The system is designed to promote **consensus** and **compromise** between the different linguistic and cultural groups, with a strong emphasis on **cooperation** and **power-sharing**.

The Belgian system of government is also characterized by a high degree of **decentralization**, with significant powers devolved to the regional and community levels. This has allowed for a high degree of autonomy and self-governance, but has also created challenges in terms of **coordination** and **policy coherence**.
