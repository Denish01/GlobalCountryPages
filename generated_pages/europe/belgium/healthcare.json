The system is divided into two main parts: the public sector and the private sector. The public sector is funded by the government and provides healthcare services to all citizens, while the private sector is funded by private insurance companies and provides additional services to those who can afford it. The quality of care in Belgium is considered to be among the best in the world, with well-equipped hospitals and highly trained medical professionals. In urban areas, access to healthcare is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics located throughout the cities. However, in rural areas, access to healthcare can be more limited, with fewer hospitals and clinics available.\n\nThe Belgian healthcare system is also known for its high level of patient satisfaction, with patients having a high degree of freedom to choose their own doctors and hospitals. The system is also relatively efficient, with short waiting times for medical procedures and a high level of coordination between different healthcare providers. Overall, the Belgian healthcare system is considered to be one of the best in the world, providing high-quality medical care to all its citizens.\n\nDespite its many strengths, the Belgian healthcare system also faces some challenges, including an aging population and a rising burden of chronic diseases. To address these challenges, the government has implemented a number of reforms, including the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of preventive care services. These reforms aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system, while also reducing costs and improving patient outcomes.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| University Hospital Leuven | Leuven | Teaching Hospital | Cardiology, Neurology, Oncology | Yes |\n| Saint-Luc University Hospital | Brussels | Teaching Hospital | Pediatrics, Surgery, Emergency Medicine | Yes |\n| Ghent University Hospital | Ghent | Teaching Hospital | Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedic Surgery | Yes |\n| University Hospital Antwerp | Antwerp | Teaching Hospital | Oncology, Hematology, Infectious Diseases | Yes |\n| European Hospital | Brussels | Private Hospital | General Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Medicine | Yes |\n| AZ Delta Hospital | Roeselare | General Hospital | General Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Medicine | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Health insurance** is recommended for all visitors to Belgium, as it can help to cover the costs of medical care in the event of an illness or injury.\n- There are several types of health insurance available in Belgium, including **private insurance** and **travel insurance**.\n- **Expats** living in Belgium may be eligible for the Belgian healthcare system, but they may also need to purchase additional insurance to cover certain services.\n- The cost of health insurance in Belgium can vary depending on the type of insurance and the level of coverage.\n- **Mutualities** are non-profit health insurance organizations that provide coverage to many Belgians, and they may also be available to visitors and expats.\n- **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)** holders may be eligible for reduced-cost or free medical care in Belgium, but they should still consider purchasing additional insurance to cover certain services.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacies** are widely available in Belgium, with many locations throughout the cities and towns.\n- A **prescription** is required for many medications in Belgium, and visitors should be sure to bring their prescription with them when traveling.\n- **Medications** are generally available in Belgium, but visitors may need to pay out-of-pocket for certain medications.\n- **Common brands** of medications are often available in Belgium, but visitors should be aware that the brand names may be different from those in their home country.\n- **Costs** for medications in Belgium can vary depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Vaccinations** are recommended for all travelers to Belgium, including **measles**, **mumps**, and **rubella (MMR)**, as well as **tetanus**, **diphtheria**, and **pertussis (Tdap)**.\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are also recommended for certain travelers, including those who will be working with children or in healthcare settings.\n- **Rabies** is present in Belgium, and travelers who will be spending time outdoors or working with animals should consider getting vaccinated.\n- **Tick-borne illnesses**, such as **Lyme disease**, are also present in Belgium, and travelers should take precautions to avoid tick bites.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Belgium, but travelers should still take precautions to avoid drinking untreated water.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good in Belgium, but travelers should still take precautions to avoid eating undercooked or raw foods.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is a growing industry in Belgium, with many hospitals and clinics offering specialized medical services to international patients.\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Belgium include **cardiovascular surgery**, **orthopedic surgery**, and **cancer treatment**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Belgium include the University Hospital Leuven and the Saint-Luc University Hospital.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists in Belgium, with prices often lower than in other European countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, travelers should call the **emergency number 112**.\n- **Ambulance** services are widely available in Belgium, and emergency medical technicians are well-trained and equipped.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by searching online or asking locals for directions.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted as soon as possible after receiving medical treatment, and travelers should be sure to keep all receipts and documentation.\n- **Language** can be a barrier in emergency situations, but many medical professionals in Belgium speak **English**, and interpreters may be available if needed.",
