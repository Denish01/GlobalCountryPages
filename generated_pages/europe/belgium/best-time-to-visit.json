The dry season, which runs from April to October, is the best time to visit Belgium, with warm and sunny weather, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as cycling, hiking, and visiting the country's many festivals and events. The wet season, which runs from November to March, is characterized by cool and rainy weather, making it less suitable for outdoor activities.\n\nThe seasons in Belgium have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season, which runs from June to August, being the busiest and most expensive time to visit. During this time, the country's cities, beaches, and tourist attractions are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are at their highest. The shoulder season, which runs from April to May and September to October, is a good time to visit Belgium, with mild weather and smaller crowds, making it ideal for exploring the country's culture, history, and natural beauty.\n\nThe winter season, which runs from December to February, is the quietest and least expensive time to visit Belgium, with many tourist attractions and businesses closed or operating on reduced hours.
