The cost of living in Belgium is slightly higher than in Eastern European countries, but lower than in Scandinavian countries. Compared to its neighbors, Belgium is more expensive than the Netherlands, but less expensive than Luxembourg. The country's unique blend of medieval architecture, rich history, and modern culture makes it a popular destination for tourists, but it can be challenging for budget travelers.

The cost of living in Belgium varies depending on the region, with the capital city Brussels being the most expensive.

Visitors can expect to pay around $10-15 USD for a meal at a local eatery, $20-30 USD for a mid-range restaurant, and $50-100 USD for a fine dining experience.
