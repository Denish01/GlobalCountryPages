[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Belgium is highly regarded and offers a wide range of options for students, including public, private, and international schools. Public education is generally considered to be of high quality and is free or subsidized for local students, with the majority of students attending public schools. The language of instruction is typically Dutch, French, or German, depending on the region, and students are required to attend school for 12 years, from the age of 6 to 18. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more personalized education and may have higher fees, but are still subject to the same curriculum and standards as public schools. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate, and catering to the needs of expat families.

The quality of education in Belgium is generally considered to be very high, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and a wide range of extracurricular activities. The education system is also highly decentralized, with each region having its own education authority and curriculum, which can make it difficult for students to move between regions. However, this also allows for a high degree of autonomy and flexibility, with schools able to tailor their curricula to meet the needs of their students. Overall, the education system in Belgium offers a wide range of options for students and is highly regarded internationally.
