[/SECTION]\nBelgium is a moderate to expensive country to live in or visit, with prices comparable to its Western European neighbors. The cost of living in Belgium is slightly higher than in Eastern European countries, but lower than in Scandinavian countries. Compared to its neighbors, Belgium is more expensive than the Netherlands, but less expensive than Luxembourg. The country's unique blend of medieval architecture, rich history, and modern culture makes it a popular destination for tourists, but it can be challenging for budget travelers. Overall, Belgium offers a high standard of living, with good healthcare, education, and infrastructure, but at a price.\n\nThe cost of living in Belgium varies depending on the region, with the capital city Brussels being the most expensive. The city is home to many international organizations, including the European Union, which drives up housing and living costs. Other major cities, such as Antwerp and Ghent, are more affordable, but still offer a high quality of life. Visitors can expect to pay around $10-15 USD for a meal at a local eatery, $20-30 USD for a mid-range restaurant, and $50-100 USD for a fine dining experience.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $20-40 | Shared rooms, basic amenities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $80-150 | Private rooms, TV, Wi-Fi, breakfast |\n| Luxury/Resort | $200-400 | High-end amenities, spa, fitness center |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $800-1,500 | City center, 1-bedroom apartment |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $500-1,000 | Outside city center, 1-bedroom apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-15 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-60 |\n| Fine Dining | $80-150 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $2-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $2-3 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-5 |\n| Domestic flight | $50-100 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 600 | 1,000 | 1,800 |\n| Food | 400 | 600 | 1,000 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 150 | 250 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 300 | 500 |\n| **Total** | **1,400** | **2,250** | **3,850** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting during the off-season (October to March) when prices for accommodations and tourist attractions are lower.\n- Buy a **Mobib** card for public transportation, which offers discounted fares and unlimited travel.\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls, which offer affordable and delicious meals.\n- Take advantage of free walking tours and museums on the first Sunday of every month.\n- Shop at local markets or supermarkets for groceries, which are cheaper than convenience stores.\n- Avoid driving in city centers, as parking fees and traffic congestion can be expensive and frustrating.",
