[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Czech Republic's property market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by a strong economy, low unemployment, and a growing demand for housing. The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a focus on renovation and redevelopment in urban areas. Prices in the capital city, Prague, are higher than in other parts of the country, but the city's popularity among tourists and expats has driven up demand and prices. The urban areas tend to have higher prices and rental yields compared to rural areas, where prices are lower and the market is less developed.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from apartments to family homes. However, the market is becoming increasingly competitive, with prices rising steadily over the past few years. The price trajectory is expected to continue upward, driven by demand from both domestic and international buyers. The government has implemented various measures to control the market, including regulations on short-term rentals and incentives for first-time buyers.

The Czech Republic's property market is also influenced by its location in the heart of Europe, making it an attractive destination for investors and expats. The country's membership in the European Union and its strong economy have created a stable and secure environment for property investment. The market is expected to continue growing, driven by demand from both domestic and international buyers, and the government's efforts to promote the country as a tourist and business destination.
