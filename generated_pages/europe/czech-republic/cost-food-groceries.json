Food prices in the country are influenced by factors such as location, with cities like Prague tend to be more expensive than smaller towns. The eating-out culture is popular in the Czech Republic, with many restaurants and cafes offering a wide range of options. However, home cooking is also common, with many locals preferring to prepare traditional dishes at home. The cost of food in the Czech Republic is generally lower compared to other European countries, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats.\n\nThe Czech Republic has a well-developed agricultural sector, which contributes to the country's food security and affordability. The country is self-sufficient in terms of food production, with many local farms producing a wide range of products, including meat, dairy, and vegetables. This has helped to keep food prices relatively low, especially for traditional Czech products. However, the prices of imported goods, such as exotic fruits and luxury foods, can be higher due to transportation and customs costs.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $0.80-1.20 | 20-30 CZK | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20-2.00 | 30-50 CZK | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.50-2.50 | 40-60 CZK | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20-2.00 | 30-50 CZK | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $4.00-6.00 | 100-150 CZK | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00-10.00 | 150-250 CZK | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $1.50-2.50 | 40-60 CZK | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50-2.50 | 40-60 CZK | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80-1.20 | 20-30 CZK | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80-1.20 | 20-30 CZK | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00-8.00 | 120-200 CZK | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.80-1.20 | 20-30 CZK | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 | (traditional Czech dishes like svickova or goulash) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-20 | (one person, main course and drink) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-40 | (3 courses, wine or beer) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-100 | (upscale, multi-course meal) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $3-5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nSupermarkets and local markets offer different shopping experiences in the Czech Republic. Supermarkets tend to have a wider range of products, including imported goods, and often offer discounts and loyalty programs. However, local markets, such as those found in Prague's Old Town, offer a more traditional shopping experience, with many vendors selling fresh produce, meats, and dairy products. Prices at local markets can be lower than in supermarkets, especially for seasonal produce. However, the selection may be limited, and bargaining is not common. In general, it's a good idea to buy fresh produce and meats at local markets, while supermarkets may be better for packaged goods and imported products.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, especially for certain products. For example, a kilogram of apples may cost 40-60 CZK at a supermarket, while at a local market, the same quantity may cost 30-50 CZK. Similarly, a loaf of bread may cost 30-50 CZK at a supermarket, while at a local market, it may cost 20-30 CZK. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary depending on the location, with markets in larger cities tend to be more expensive than those in smaller towns.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Traditional Czech dishes like svickova, goulash, and roast pork are often the cheapest options at restaurants and cafes.\n- Buying fresh produce and meats at local markets can be a good way to save money and support local farmers.\n- Local cheese, such as **hermelin** or **svatelok**, is a good value and can be found at most supermarkets and markets.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, such as exotic fruits or luxury foods, as they can be expensive due to transportation and customs costs.\n- Consider buying **seznam**, a Czech food basket, which typically includes a selection of local products like bread, cheese, and meats, and can be a good value.\n- Eating at **hospoda**, traditional Czech pubs, can be a good way to experience local cuisine and culture, with prices often lower than at restaurants.",
