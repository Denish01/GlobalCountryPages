The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a focus on renovation and redevelopment in urban areas. Prices in the capital city, Prague, are higher than in other parts of the country, but the city's popularity among tourists and expats has driven up demand and prices. The urban areas tend to have higher prices and rental yields compared to rural areas, where prices are lower and the market is less developed.\n\nThe current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from apartments to family homes. However, the market is becoming increasingly competitive, with prices rising steadily over the past few years. The price trajectory is expected to continue upward, driven by demand from both domestic and international buyers. The government has implemented various measures to control the market, including regulations on short-term rentals and incentives for first-time buyers.\n\nThe Czech Republic's property market is also influenced by its location in the heart of Europe, making it an attractive destination for investors and expats. The country's membership in the European Union and its strong economy have created a stable and secure environment for property investment. The market is expected to continue growing, driven by demand from both domestic and international buyers, and the government's efforts to promote the country as a tourist and business destination.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Prague 1 | $3,500 | $800 | Apartment |\n| Prague 2 | $2,800 | $600 | Apartment |\n| Smichov | $2,200 | $500 | Apartment |\n| Brno | $1,800 | $400 | Apartment |\n| Ostrava | $1,500 | $300 | House |\n| Plzen | $1,200 | $250 | House |\n| Karlovy Vary | $1,000 | $200 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in the Czech Republic without any major restrictions, but they may need to obtain a permit from the Ministry of Interior in some cases.\n- Foreign companies can also buy property, but they need to register with the commercial registry and obtain a tax identification number.\n- There are no restrictions on the type of property that can be bought, but foreigners may need to obtain a permit to buy agricultural land or property in protected areas.\n- Foreigners who buy property in the Czech Republic are subject to the same taxes and fees as Czech citizens, including a 4% transfer tax and a 0.1-0.2% annual property tax.\n- Foreigners who plan to rent out their property may need to obtain a license from the local authorities and comply with certain regulations, such as registering with the tax authorities and obtaining a tax identification number.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
