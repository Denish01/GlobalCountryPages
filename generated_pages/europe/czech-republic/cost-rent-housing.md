[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Czech Republic is relatively competitive, especially in larger cities like Prague, where demand for housing is high. Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and tenants have the right to cancel their lease with a minimum of three months' notice. Compared to regional neighbors, the Czech Republic's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Germany and Austria, but higher than in Slovakia and Poland.

The Czech Republic's housing market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by a strong economy and a growing expat community. However, this growth has also led to increasing prices, making it more challenging for locals and expats alike to find affordable housing. Despite this, the country still offers a relatively high standard of living at a lower cost compared to many Western European countries. For example, the cost of living in Prague is approximately 30% lower than in Berlin, Germany, making it an attractive option for expats and digital nomads.
