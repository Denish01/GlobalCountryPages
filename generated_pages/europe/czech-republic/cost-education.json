Public schools are generally of high quality and are free or subsidized for students, including international students. The language of instruction is Czech, but many schools also offer classes in English and other languages. Compulsory education lasts for 9 years, typically from age 6 to 15, and is divided into primary and secondary education. Private schools, on the other hand, offer an alternative to public education, with some schools offering bilingual or international curricula.\n\nThe Czech Republic is also home to a number of international schools, which cater to the needs of expat families and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the British GCSE and A-level programs. These schools often have higher fees than public or private schools, but offer a high-quality education and a international community. Some international schools also offer boarding options for students who are not based in the Czech Republic.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, Czech language of instruction |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Range of quality and curricula, bilingual options available |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, Czech language of instruction |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of quality and curricula, bilingual options available |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | IB, GCSE, and A-level curricula, English language of instruction |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $0-$1,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Czech language of instruction, some programs in English |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Range of programs, including business and engineering |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$3,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Charles University, Czech language of instruction, some programs in English |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Range of quality and services |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Range of subjects and qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Czech language courses, group or private |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, including books and materials |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for some private and international schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The Czech Republic has a high-quality education system, with a strong emphasis on public education.\n- Expats often choose international schools for their children, which offer a range of curricula and languages.\n- Scholarships are available for international students, particularly for those studying at public universities.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular, with many universities offering distance learning programs.\n- The Czech Republic is a great destination for students who want to learn Czech or study in a European country with a rich history and culture.\n- [CALLOUT] It's worth noting that the cost of living in the Czech Republic is relatively low compared to other European countries, making it an attractive destination for international students.",
