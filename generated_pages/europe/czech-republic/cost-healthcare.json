  "content": "In the Czech Republic, healthcare costs vary between public and private institutions, with the average health expenditure per capita being $2,693, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 14.1% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,693\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 14.1%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: CZK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Czech Republic has a mixed healthcare system, which combines elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is available to all citizens and registered foreigners. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and the quality of care may vary depending on the location and type of facility. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers shorter waiting times and more modern facilities, but is generally more expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is usually the first point of contact, while foreigners may prefer to use private healthcare services, especially if they have private health insurance.\n\nFor foreigners living in the Czech Republic, it is recommended to have health insurance, as the public healthcare system may not cover all expenses, especially for specialized treatments. There are several types of health insurance available, including basic local insurance, comprehensive private insurance, and international expat insurance. The cost of health insurance varies depending on the type of coverage, age, and health status of the individual. It is essential to research and compare different insurance options to find the one that best suits your needs and budget. Additionally, some employers may offer health insurance as part of their employee benefits package, so it's worth checking with your employer to see if this is an option.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's qualifications |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by dentist's qualifications and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by optometrist's qualifications and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by laboratory and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of treatment |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Prices vary by type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialized procedures, dental and eye care |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and specialized procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally cheaper in the Czech Republic than in other European countries, with prices starting from $5-$10 for basic medications.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available in pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices starting from $5-$10.\n- Pharmacy chains like Dr. Max and Benu offer a wide range of medications and health products, with prices varying by location and product.\n- Prescription rules are strict, and medications can only be dispensed by licensed pharmacists.\n- Some medications may require a doctor's prescription, while others can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- Pharmacists are generally knowledgeable and can offer advice on medication use and interactions.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the emergency number 112, which is available 24/7.
