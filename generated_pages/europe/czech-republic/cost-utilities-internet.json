The costs of utilities in the country are generally stable, but can fluctuate depending on the season. For example, heating costs are higher during the winter months, while electricity costs can be higher during the summer months when air conditioning is used. The country has a relatively low inflation rate of 2.4%, which helps to keep utility costs stable.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in the Czech Republic is high, with a strong focus on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. The country aims to reduce its carbon footprint and increase its use of renewable energy sources, which can help to reduce utility costs in the long run.
