Citizens of over 60 countries can enter the Czech Republic without a visa, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, for a stay of up to 90 days within a 180-day period.

The duration of the student visa is typically 1 year, and it can be extended.\n**Workers:** Workers must have a job offer from a Czech employer and apply for a work visa. They must provide a contract, proof of qualifications, and a valid passport.
