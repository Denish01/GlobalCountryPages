[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The Czech Republic has a well-regarded education system, with a strong emphasis on public education. Public schools are generally of high quality and are free or subsidized for students, including international students. The language of instruction is Czech, but many schools also offer classes in English and other languages. Compulsory education lasts for 9 years, typically from age 6 to 15, and is divided into primary and secondary education. Private schools, on the other hand, offer an alternative to public education, with some schools offering bilingual or international curricula.

The Czech Republic is also home to a number of international schools, which cater to the needs of expat families and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the British GCSE and A-level programs. These schools often have higher fees than public or private schools, but offer a high-quality education and a international community. Some international schools also offer boarding options for students who are not based in the Czech Republic.
