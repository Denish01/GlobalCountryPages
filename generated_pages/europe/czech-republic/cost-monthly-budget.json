This affordability is reflected in the prices of everyday items, such as food, transportation, and housing. For example, a meal at a mid-range restaurant can cost around $10-15 per person, while a one-bedroom apartment in the city center can cost around $400-600 per month. Compared to neighboring countries like Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic is generally more affordable, while still offering a high standard of living. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with larger cities like Prague tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe Czech Republic's cost of living also varies depending on the individual's lifestyle and preferences. For example, a budget-conscious individual can live on around $600-800 per month, while a mid-range lifestyle would require around $1,200-1,600 per month. A comfortable lifestyle, on the other hand, would require around $2,500-3,200 per month. These estimates are based on the assumption that the individual will be living in a shared apartment, cooking most meals, and using public transportation. However, prices can add up quickly if the individual prefers to eat out frequently, use taxis or rent a car, or live in a luxury apartment.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 200-300 | 400-600 | 800-1,200 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 150-250 | 250-400 | 400-600 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 50-100 | 100-150 | 150-250 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-600 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |  |\n| Savings / Misc | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-600 |  |\n| **Total** | **620-1,100** | **1,200-2,200** | **2,500-4,000** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nAt the budget level, daily life in the Czech Republic would involve sharing an apartment with roommates, cooking most meals, and using public transportation.
