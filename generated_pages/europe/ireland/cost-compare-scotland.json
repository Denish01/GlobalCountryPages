Ireland has a more developed economy, driven by technology, pharmaceuticals, and foreign investment, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Scotland's economy is more diversified, with a strong presence of industries like finance, tourism, and manufacturing.

On average, Scotland is around 10-15% cheaper than Ireland, with notable differences in housing, food, and transportation costs.\n\nThe cost of living difference between Ireland and Scotland can be attributed to various factors, including taxes, labor costs, and market conditions. Ireland's higher GDP per capita and inflation rate contribute to its more expensive lifestyle, whereas Scotland's relatively lower costs make it an attractive destination for those seeking a balance between quality of life and affordability.
