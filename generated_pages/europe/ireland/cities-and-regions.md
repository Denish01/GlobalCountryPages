[SECTION] How Ireland Is Divided [/SECTION]
Ireland is divided into four provinces: Connacht, Leinster, Munster, and Ulster. However, for administrative purposes, the country is divided into 26 counties, each with its own local government. These counties are further divided into cities, towns, and villages. The provinces, on the other hand, are more historical and cultural in nature, with each having its own unique character and identity. The division of Ireland into provinces and counties dates back to the early medieval period, with the provinces being based on the ancient kingdoms of Ireland.

The administrative structure of Ireland is relatively straightforward, with the central government based in Dublin and the local governments in each county responsible for providing services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The provinces, while not having any formal administrative role, still play an important part in Irish identity and culture, with many people identifying themselves as being from a particular province.
