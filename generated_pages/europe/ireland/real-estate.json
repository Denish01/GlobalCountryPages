The market is currently characterized by high demand and limited supply, particularly in urban areas such as Dublin. As a result, prices have been rising steadily, with the average price per square meter in Dublin reaching $4,500 USD. The market is expected to continue growing, although at a slower pace, with prices projected to increase by 5-10% per annum. The urban-rural divide is also a significant factor in the Irish property market, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas.\n\nThe Irish government has implemented various measures to address the housing shortage, including increasing funding for affordable housing and introducing rent control measures. Despite these efforts, the market remains highly competitive, with many buyers competing for a limited number of properties. The **rental market** is also experiencing strong demand, with many tenants competing for a limited number of properties, particularly in urban areas.\n\nIn terms of **price trajectory**, the Irish property market has experienced a significant increase in prices over the past decade, with some areas experiencing price growth of up to 50%.
