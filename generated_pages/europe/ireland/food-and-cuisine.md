Irish cuisine is often associated with hearty and comforting dishes, such as stews and soups, which are perfect for the country's cool and temperate climate. Regional variations are also evident, with different parts of the country specializing in different types of cuisine, such as seafood in coastal areas and meat dishes in inland areas.

Ireland's cuisine has been influenced by various cultures, including the Vikings, the Normans, and the British, who introduced new ingredients and cooking techniques to the country.
