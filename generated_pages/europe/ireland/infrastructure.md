[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Ireland's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with investments in transportation, energy, and telecommunications. The country has a well-developed road network, a comprehensive rail system, and a modern airport infrastructure. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural regions often lacking access to high-speed internet and other modern amenities. Recent investments have focused on bridging this gap, with initiatives such as the National Broadband Plan aimed at providing high-speed internet to all parts of the country. Overall, Ireland's infrastructure is well-suited to support its growing economy and population.

Ireland's infrastructure development has been driven by a combination of government investment and private sector participation. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the National Development Plan, which aims to invest €116 billion in infrastructure development between 2018 and 2027. This plan includes investments in transportation, energy, and telecommunications, as well as initiatives to improve water and sanitation services.

Despite these investments, Ireland still faces some infrastructure challenges, particularly in rural areas. Many rural communities lack access to high-speed internet, and the country's rail network is limited in some parts of the country. However, the government is working to address these challenges, with initiatives such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund aimed at supporting the development of rural areas.
