Typical lease terms are 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Residential Tenancies Act, which regulates rent increases, lease terminations, and landlord-tenant disputes. Compared to its regional neighbors, Ireland's housing costs are relatively high, driven by strong economic growth, limited housing supply, and high demand from expats and students.\n\nThe Irish housing market has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, with prices rising rapidly in the post-recession period. However, the government has implemented measures to control rent increases and promote affordable housing. Despite these efforts, housing affordability remains a challenge, particularly for low- and moderate-income households. The country's housing costs are also influenced by its high standard of living, with Ireland ranking among the top countries in terms of GDP per capita and human development index.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,200-$1,800 | $900-$1,400 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,300-$2,000 | $1,000-$1,600 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,800 | $1,400-$2,200 | spacious, family-friendly |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $2,000-$3,200 | luxurious, high-end finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $6,500-$10,000 | prime locations, high-rise apartments |\n| Suburbs | $4,000-$7,000 | residential areas, semi-detached homes |\n| Rural | $2,500-$4,500 | countryside, farmhouses, or cottages |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Portobello**: a trendy neighborhood with a mix of Victorian and modern homes, rent range $1,800-$3,000 per month\n- **Ranelagh**: a charming suburb with a village-like atmosphere, rent range $2,000-$3,500 per month\n- **Dublin 4**: a prestigious area with upscale homes and apartments, rent range $2,500-$4,500 per month\n- **Temple Bar**: a lively neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $1,500-$2,500 per month\n- **Clontarf**: a coastal suburb with a mix of modern and period homes, rent range $1,800-$3,200 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Ireland [/SECTION]\n- Research the local rental market and prices to determine a fair rent\n- Inspect the property thoroughly before signing a lease\n- Understand your rights and responsibilities as a tenant under the Residential Tenancies Act\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market can be competitive\n- Consider working with a reputable letting agent or property manager to find a suitable property\n- Be aware of potential scams, such as fake rental listings or unauthorized landlords, and always verify the property owner's identity and credentials before signing a lease or paying a deposit",
