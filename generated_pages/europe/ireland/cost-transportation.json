The main modes of transportation are buses, trains, and taxis, with many cities also having bike-sharing schemes and pedestrianized areas. The quality of public transit in Ireland is generally good, with frequent and reliable services connecting major towns and cities. Most people in Ireland get around by car, with many households owning at least one vehicle, but public transportation is also widely used, particularly in urban areas.\n\nThe public transportation system in Ireland is managed by a number of different operators, including Bus Éireann, Irish Rail, and Dublin Bus. These operators provide a range of services, including city buses, commuter trains, and intercity buses. Many of these services are frequent and reliable, making it easy to get around without a car. In addition to public transportation, there are also many private bus operators and taxi companies, providing alternative options for getting around.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2.83 | $94 | Good coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available outside of Dublin |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2.83 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | $5.66-$11.32 | $132 | Frequent services in urban areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $4 | $1.73 | $10-$15 | Available in all major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.50 | $1.45 | $8-$12 | Free Now, Uber, Bolt available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $25-$35 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.73 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.63 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$4 | Depending on location and time of day |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Depending on route and distance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$40 | Depending on route and operator |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Typical route, e.g. Dublin to Cork |\n| Train (long-distance) | $30-$60 | Depending on route and class of service |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider purchasing a **Leap Card**, which can be used to pay for public transportation fares and can also be topped up for use in taxis and other services.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like **Free Now**, **Uber**, and **Bolt** to get around cities, as they can often be cheaper than traditional taxis.\n- Be aware of **peak hour** traffic in cities, as this can increase journey times and costs.\n- Consider renting a car for **intercity travel**, as this can often be cheaper than public transportation, especially for groups.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** with a taxi driver before you start your journey, especially if you're traveling a long distance.\n- Use **parking apps** to find and pay for parking in cities, as this can often be more convenient than using cash.",
