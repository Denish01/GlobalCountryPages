[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Ireland's rental market is highly competitive, particularly in urban areas such as Dublin, where demand often outstrips supply. Typical lease terms are 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Residential Tenancies Act, which regulates rent increases, lease terminations, and landlord-tenant disputes. Compared to its regional neighbors, Ireland's housing costs are relatively high, driven by strong economic growth, limited housing supply, and high demand from expats and students.

The Irish housing market has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, with prices rising rapidly in the post-recession period. However, the government has implemented measures to control rent increases and promote affordable housing. Despite these efforts, housing affordability remains a challenge, particularly for low- and moderate-income households. The country's housing costs are also influenced by its high standard of living, with Ireland ranking among the top countries in terms of GDP per capita and human development index.
