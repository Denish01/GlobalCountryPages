[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Ireland's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and some services may not be available in all areas. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the first point of contact, with many services provided free of charge or at a reduced cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance, as public healthcare services may not be available or may be limited. Private healthcare services are also available, offering a wider range of services and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost.

The healthcare system in Ireland is overseen by the Health Service Executive (HSE), which is responsible for providing public healthcare services. The HSE also regulates private healthcare providers and ensures that they meet certain standards. In addition to public and private healthcare services, there are also voluntary health insurance schemes available, which can provide additional coverage and benefits. These schemes are popular among both locals and foreigners, as they can help to reduce out-of-pocket expenses and provide access to a wider range of services.
