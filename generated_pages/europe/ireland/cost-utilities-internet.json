  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Ireland can range from $150 to $300 per month for a medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and provider.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200-$250 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($40-$60 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20-$30 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nIreland's utility infrastructure is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity and heating costs during the winter months. The country's mild climate means that air conditioning is not typically required, but heating costs can be significant during the colder months. Overall, utility costs in Ireland are relatively high compared to other European countries, but the quality of the infrastructure is generally good.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Ireland is also influenced by the country's energy policy, which aims to reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of renewable energy sources. As a result, there may be incentives for households to switch to more energy-efficient appliances and lighting. Additionally, some utility providers offer discounts for customers who pay their bills online or by direct debit. It's worth noting that utility costs can vary significantly depending on the region, with urban areas tend to have higher costs than rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80-$120 | $120-$180 | $180-$250 | depends on usage and efficiency |\n| Water | $20-$30 | $30-$40 | $40-$50 | includes wastewater treatment |\n| Gas / Heating | $50-$70 | $70-$100 | $100-$130 | depends on insulation and efficiency |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | $30-$40 | includes waste collection and disposal |\n| **Total** | **$160-$240** | **$240-$350** | **$350-$470** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-$50 | 30-60 Mbps | Eir, Virgin Media |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-$80 | 100-300 Mbps | Eir, Virgin Media, Vodafone |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-$20 | 1-5 GB | Vodafone, Three, Meteor |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$30 | 5-10 GB | Vodafone, Three, Meteor |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $60-$100 | varies | Eir, Virgin Media, Vodafone |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10-$15 | 2 screens, HD |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10-$15 | individual plan |\n| Local Streaming | $5-$10 | RTE Player, Virgin Media Player |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Ireland, you will typically need to provide proof of address and identification, and may need to pay a deposit or connection fee.\n- Prepaid electricity meters can be a good option for households with variable income or usage patterns, as they allow you to pay for energy as you use it.\n- The best internet providers in Ireland include Eir, Virgin Media, and Vodafone, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, consider switching to energy-efficient appliances and lighting, and look for discounts or promotions from your utility provider.\n- It's also worth considering a **bundle deal** that includes multiple services, such as internet, phone, and TV, as these can often be cheaper than buying each service separately.",
