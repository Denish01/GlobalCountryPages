[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Irish property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including a strong economy, low interest rates, and a shortage of housing supply. The market is currently characterized by high demand and limited supply, particularly in urban areas such as Dublin. As a result, prices have been rising steadily, with the average price per square meter in Dublin reaching $4,500 USD. The market is expected to continue growing, although at a slower pace, with prices projected to increase by 5-10% per annum. The urban-rural divide is also a significant factor in the Irish property market, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas.

The Irish government has implemented various measures to address the housing shortage, including increasing funding for affordable housing and introducing rent control measures. Despite these efforts, the market remains highly competitive, with many buyers competing for a limited number of properties. The **rental market** is also experiencing strong demand, with many tenants competing for a limited number of properties, particularly in urban areas.

In terms of **price trajectory**, the Irish property market has experienced a significant increase in prices over the past decade, with some areas experiencing price growth of up to 50%. However, the market is expected to slow down in the coming years, with prices projected to increase at a more moderate pace. The **urban vs rural** divide is also an important factor to consider, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas.
