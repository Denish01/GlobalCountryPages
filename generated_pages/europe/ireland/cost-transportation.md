[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]
- Consider purchasing a **Leap Card**, which can be used to pay for public transportation fares and can also be topped up for use in taxis and other services.
- Use ride-hailing apps like **Free Now**, **Uber**, and **Bolt** to get around cities, as they can often be cheaper than traditional taxis.
- Be aware of **peak hour** traffic in cities, as this can increase journey times and costs.
- Consider renting a car for **intercity travel**, as this can often be cheaper than public transportation, especially for groups.
- Always **negotiate the fare** with a taxi driver before you start your journey, especially if you're traveling a long distance.
- Use **parking apps** to find and pay for parking in cities, as this can often be more convenient than using cash.
