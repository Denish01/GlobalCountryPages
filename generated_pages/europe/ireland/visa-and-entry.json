[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nIreland has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of over 60 countries, including the US, UK, and many European nations, can enter Ireland visa-free for tourism or business stays of up to 90 days. However, some nationalities require a visa before arrival, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an electronic visa system. Ireland's visa policy aims to balance the need to facilitate travel and tourism with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.\n\nIreland's visa-free access policy allows citizens of many countries to enter the country without a visa, making it a popular destination for tourists and business travelers. However, it's essential to note that visa-free access does not guarantee entry, and immigration officers may still request additional documentation or information to verify the purpose and duration of the stay.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | No limit | Can live and work in Ireland without restrictions |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Visa required | Up to 90 days | Must apply for a visa through the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Visa required | Up to 90 days | Must apply for a visa through the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Ireland visa-free for up to 90 days, provided they have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds to support their stay. The typical stay for tourists is 7-14 days, but this can be extended up to 90 days. To extend their stay, tourists must apply to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.\n**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may need to provide additional documentation, such as an invitation letter from an Irish company, proof of business activities, and a valid passport. The requirements for business travelers are similar to those for tourists, but they may need to provide more detailed information about their business activities.\n**Students:** Students must have a valid passport, a letter of acceptance from an Irish educational institution, and proof of sufficient funds to support their stay. The duration of stay for students depends on the length of their course, but they must apply for a student visa through the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.\n**Workers:** Workers must have a valid passport, a job offer from an Irish employer, and a work permit. The requirements for workers are more stringent than those for tourists or business travelers, and they must apply for a work visa through the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.\n\n[SECTION] Documents Checklist [/SECTION]\n1.
