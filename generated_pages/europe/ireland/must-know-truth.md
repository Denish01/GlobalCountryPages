# The Truth About Ireland - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Ireland's history dates back to the **Mesolithic era**, with the first human settlements emerging around 8,000 years ago. The island was later inhabited by the **Celts**, who arrived around 500 BCE and had a significant impact on the country's language, culture, and identity. In the 12th century, Ireland was **invaded by the Normans**, who established a feudal system and introduced **English** as a language.

The **Good Friday Agreement** in 1998 marked a significant step towards peace and reconciliation in the region.
