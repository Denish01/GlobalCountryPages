        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Ireland's history dates back to the <strong>Mesolithic era</strong>, with the first human settlements emerging around 8,000 years ago. The island was later inhabited by the <strong>Celts</strong>, who arrived around 500 BCE and had a significant impact on the country's language, culture, and identity. In the 12th century, Ireland was <strong>invaded by the Normans</strong>, who established a feudal system and introduced <strong>English</strong> as a language. Over the centuries, Ireland was subject to various forms of <strong>British rule</strong>, with the <strong>Act of Union</strong> in 1801 formally incorporating Ireland into the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>The struggle for Irish <strong>independence</strong> began in the late 19th century, with the <strong>Irish National Land League</strong> and the <strong>Gaelic Revival</strong> movement seeking to promote Irish culture and self-governance. The <strong>Easter Rising</strong> in 1916 marked a significant turning point in the fight for independence, with the <strong>Anglo-Irish Treaty</strong> of 1921 establishing the <strong>Irish Free State</strong>. However, this treaty also led to the <strong>Irish Civil War</strong>, which lasted from 1922 to 1923. In 1949, Ireland officially became a <strong>sovereign state</strong>, known as the Republic of Ireland.</p>
        <p>The <strong>partition of Ireland</strong> in 1921 resulted in the creation of <strong>Northern Ireland</strong>, which remained part of the United Kingdom. This division has had a lasting impact on Irish politics and society, with the <strong>Troubles</strong> in Northern Ireland lasting from the late 1960s to the late 1990s. The <strong>Good Friday Agreement</strong> in 1998 marked a significant step towards peace and reconciliation in the region.</p>
        <p>Ireland's history has been shaped by its complex relationships with <strong>Europe</strong> and the <strong>British Empire</strong>. The country's strategic location in the <strong>North Atlantic</strong> has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange. Today, Ireland is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> and a member of the <strong>European Union</strong>, with a unique cultural identity and a strong sense of national pride.</p>
