  "content": "Healthcare in Ireland can be expensive, with an average health expenditure per capita of $7,395, and out-of-pocket spending accounting for 10.6% of total healthcare expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $7,395\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 10.6%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112 or 999\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nIreland's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and some services may not be available in all areas. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the first point of contact, with many services provided free of charge or at a reduced cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance, as public healthcare services may not be available or may be limited. Private healthcare services are also available, offering a wider range of services and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe healthcare system in Ireland is overseen by the Health Service Executive (HSE), which is responsible for providing public healthcare services. The HSE also regulates private healthcare providers and ensures that they meet certain standards. In addition to public and private healthcare services, there are also voluntary health insurance schemes available, which can provide additional coverage and benefits. These schemes are popular among both locals and foreigners, as they can help to reduce out-of-pocket expenses and provide access to a wider range of services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Public cost is free for medical card holders |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$250 | $250-$500 | Public cost is free for medical card holders, but waiting times can be long |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$250 | Public cost is free for medical card holders, but services are limited |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Public cost is free for medical card holders, but services are limited |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public cost is free for medical card holders |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public cost is free for medical card holders, but may incur a fee for non-emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Public cost is free for medical card holders, but may incur a fee for private rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $2,000-$10,000 | Public cost is free for medical card holders, but waiting times can be long |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Public cost is free for medical card holders, but may incur a fee for private rooms |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Public cost is free for medical card holders, but waiting times can be long |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Public cost is free for medical card holders |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $100-$300 | Public hospital services, GP visits, and some specialist services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $500-$1,500 | Private hospital services, specialist services, and some additional benefits like dental and optical care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Emergency medical evacuation, repatriation, and some additional benefits like travel insurance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10-$50 per item, depending on the type and brand\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and can cost between $5-$20 per item\n- Pharmacies are widely available, with many open late or 24 hours\n- Prescription rules are strict, and medication can only be dispensed by a licensed pharmacist\n- Some medication may require a doctor's prescription, while others can be purchased over-the-counter\n- Prices for medication can vary depending on the pharmacy and location\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number 112 or 999.
