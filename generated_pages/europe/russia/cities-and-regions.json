The administrative structure of Russia is complex, with a mix of republics, oblasts, krais, and autonomous okrugs, each with their own powers and responsibilities. The federal subjects are grouped into eight federal districts, which are overseen by a presidential representative. This system allows for a degree of regional autonomy, while also maintaining a strong central government.\n\nThe division of Russia into federal subjects is largely based on historical, cultural, and geographical factors. Many of the republics, for example, are home to distinct ethnic groups, while the oblasts and krais are often centered around major cities or economic hubs. This diversity is reflected in the wide range of languages, customs, and traditions that can be found across Russia, from the Baltic coast to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Moscow** (12.6M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, stunning architecture, and world-class museums, including the Kremlin and the Tretyakov Gallery\nBest For: history buffs, culture lovers, and business travelers\n\n**St. Petersburg** (5.2M)\nRole: cultural center, port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its beautiful canals, stunning palaces, and rich cultural heritage, including the Hermitage Museum\nBest For: art lovers, history enthusiasts, and those interested in Russian literature\n\n**Novosibirsk** (1.6M)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, transportation hub\nKnown For: its vibrant cultural scene, stunning opera house, and proximity to the Ob River\nBest For: business travelers, culture lovers, and outdoor enthusiasts\n\n**Yekaterinburg** (1.5M)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its rich history, stunning architecture, and proximity to the Ural Mountains\nBest For: history buffs, culture lovers, and those interested in Russian industry\n\n**Nizhny Novgorod** (1.3M)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its stunning Kremlin, beautiful canals, and rich cultural heritage\nBest For: history enthusiasts, culture lovers, and those interested in Russian trade and commerce\n\n**Kazan** (1.2M)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub, historic city\nKnown For: its stunning Kremlin, beautiful mosques, and rich cultural heritage\nBest For: history buffs, culture lovers, and those interested in Russian-Tatar relations\n\n**Rostov-on-Don** (1.1M)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, port city\nKnown For: its stunning riverfront, vibrant cultural scene, and proximity to the Black Sea\nBest For: business travelers, culture lovers, and those interested in Russian trade and commerce\n\n**Chelyabinsk** (1.1M)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, industrial city\nKnown For: its rich history, stunning architecture, and proximity to the Ural Mountains\nBest For: business travelers, culture lovers, and those interested in Russian industry\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central Federal District | densely populated, economically developed | Moscow, historic cities, cultural attractions | Moscow |\n| Northwestern Federal District | coastal, industrial, cultural | St. Petersburg, ports, historic cities | St. Petersburg |\n| Volga Federal District | industrial, agricultural, cultural | Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, historic cities | Kazan |\n| Ural Federal District | industrial, natural resources, outdoor recreation | Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Ural Mountains | Yekaterinburg |\n| Siberian Federal District | vast, sparsely populated, natural resources | Novosibirsk, Lake Baikal, Trans-Siberian Railway | Novosibirsk |\n| Far Eastern Federal District | coastal, sparsely populated, natural resources | Vladivostok, ports, Pacific Ocean | Vladivostok |\n| North Caucasian Federal District | mountainous, cultural, agricultural | Pyatigorsk, mineral springs, historic cities | Pyatigorsk |\n| Crimean Federal District | coastal, tourist, cultural | Simferopol, Black Sea, historic cities | Simferopol |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- Culture: Russia's regions have distinct cultural identities, shaped by their history, ethnicity, and geography.
