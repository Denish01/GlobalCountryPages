        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Russia's cultural identity is defined by its rich history, diverse ethnic and linguistic makeup, and the blending of Eastern and Western influences. With over 190 ethnic groups, Russia is a multicultural society, but the majority of the population is ethnically Russian, and the official language is Russian. The country's strategic location between Europe and Asia has made it a crossroads of cultural exchange, with significant influences from Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and other faiths. Russian culture is also characterized by its strong literary and artistic traditions, with famous authors like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov, and renowned composers like Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff.</p>
        <p>The Russian people are known for their warm hospitality and welcoming nature, with a strong emphasis on family and community ties. The concept of <strong>sobornost</strong>, or communal harmony, is deeply ingrained in Russian culture, and is reflected in the country's many traditional festivals and celebrations. Russia's cultural identity is also shaped by its complex and often tumultuous history, with periods of imperial grandeur, revolution, and Soviet-era repression. Today, Russia is a modern, rapidly changing society, with a growing middle class and a vibrant cultural scene.</p>
        <p>Despite its many regional variations, Russian culture is united by a shared sense of pride and patriotism, with a strong emphasis on national identity and tradition. From the majestic cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg to the vast, rugged landscapes of Siberia and the Far East, Russia is a country of stunning natural beauty and cultural richness, with a unique blend of European and Asian influences. Whether you're interested in history, literature, music, or art, Russia has something to offer, and its warm and welcoming people are always eager to share their culture with visitors.</p>
