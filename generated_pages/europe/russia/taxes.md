[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Russia has a **territorial taxation** system, where tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the taxpayer's residency status. However, **worldwide taxation** applies to tax residents, who are required to report and pay tax on their global income. To be considered a tax resident in Russia, an individual must spend at least 183 days in the country within a 12-month period. This residency rule is crucial for determining tax obligations, as tax residents are subject to taxation on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on their Russian-sourced income.

The Russian tax system is governed by the Tax Code, which outlines the rules and regulations for taxation. The Tax Code is divided into two parts: the first part deals with general provisions, while the second part covers specific taxes, including income tax, corporate tax, and VAT. Understanding the Tax Code is essential for navigating the tax system in Russia, and seeking professional advice is recommended to ensure compliance with all tax laws and regulations.
