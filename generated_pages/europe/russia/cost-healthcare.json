  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Russia varies significantly between public and private facilities, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 28.4% of total healthcare expenditure, and the average annual health expenditure per capita standing at $1,003.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,003\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 28.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112 or 103 for ambulance\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: RUB\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nRussia's healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, with longer wait times and less modern equipment. For locals, the public system is often the primary option due to its lower costs, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a principles of compulsory medical insurance, where every citizen is entitled to free medical care, but the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the region and facility. Insurance is not strictly required, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help navigate the complex healthcare system.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Russia can vary greatly depending on the region, with major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg tend to have better-equipped and staffed facilities compared to rural areas. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek private healthcare, as the quality of care is generally higher and the staff is more likely to speak English. Additionally, many private facilities in Russia have international accreditation and are equipped with modern medical equipment, making them a popular choice among expats and tourists. However, the costs of private healthcare can be significantly higher than public healthcare, and insurance is often necessary to cover these expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and specialty |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by city and specialty |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and type of procedure |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by city and type of procedure |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and type of test |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and hospital |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | Prices vary by city and hospital |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by city, hospital, and type of procedure |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Prices vary by city and hospital |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Prices vary by city and hospital |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and hospital |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public healthcare, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private healthcare, specialist consultations, hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | International coverage, emergency evacuations, comprehensive medical procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $5-$20 per month, depending on the type and brand\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available and can cost between $2-$10 per pack\n- Pharmacies are readily available in major cities, but can be scarce in rural areas\n- Prescription rules vary depending on the medication, but generally require a doctor's prescription\n- Common medications such as painkillers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$10 per pack\n- Medications for chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension can cost between $10-$50 per month\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 112 or 103 for ambulance, and provide as much information as possible about the situation. Ambulance services are generally available, but response times can vary depending on the location and traffic conditions. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical attention at a private hospital or clinic, as the staff is more likely to speak English and the facilities are generally better equipped. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Russia include the European Medical Center in Moscow and the St. Petersburg Clinical Hospital.\n\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to remain calm and provide as much information as possible to the emergency services. If possible, it is recommended to have a friend or family member who speaks Russian accompany you to the hospital to help with communication. Additionally, it is a good idea to have a list of important phone numbers, such as your insurance provider and embassy, readily available in case of an emergency. Overall, while the Russian healthcare system can be complex and challenging to navigate, there are many resources available to help foreigners and locals alike receive the medical attention they need.",
