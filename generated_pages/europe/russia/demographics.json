  "content": "Russia is home to a diverse population of over 146 million people, with a mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that reflect the country's complex history and geography.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 146 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.3%\nMedian Age: 40.3 years\nUrban Population: 74.8%\nPopulation Density: 8.5 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 72.6 years\nFertility Rate: 1.6 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nRussia's population is the ninth-largest in the world, with a relatively slow growth rate due to a low fertility rate and a high mortality rate. The country's population has been declining since the mid-1990s, with a peak of 148.7 million in 1995. However, the population has been relatively stable in recent years, with a slight increase due to improved healthcare and a decline in mortality rates. Urbanization is a significant trend in Russia, with over 74% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the western and central regions. Migration patterns are also an important factor, with many Russians moving from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of Russia is also characterized by a significant regional disparity, with the majority of the population concentrated in the European part of the country. The eastern regions, such as Siberia and the Far East, are sparsely populated, with many rural areas experiencing significant out-migration. The government has implemented various policies to encourage migration to these regions, including economic incentives and investments in infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Russia's population is facing significant challenges, including a low fertility rate, an aging population, and regional disparities. However, the country is also experiencing positive trends, such as improved healthcare and a decline in mortality rates, which are contributing to a relatively stable population.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Russian | 81% | Throughout the country | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Tatar | 3.9% | Tatarstan, Bashkortostan | Significant minority group |\n| Bashkir | 1.4% | Bashkortostan | Indigenous group in the Ural Mountains |\n| Chuvash | 1.2% | Chuvashia | Turkic-speaking group in the Volga region |\n| Chechen | 1.0% | Chechnya | Indigenous group in the North Caucasus |\n| Avar | 0.9% | Dagestan | Indigenous group in the North Caucasus |\n| Mordvin | 0.8% | Mordovia | Finno-Ugric-speaking group in the Volga region |\n[/TABLE]\nRussia is a multicultural and multi-ethnic country, with over 190 ethnic groups represented.
