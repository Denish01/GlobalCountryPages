        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Russia's history dates back to the 9th century when <strong>Kievan Rus'</strong>, a medieval East Slavic state, was founded. The state was formed in 882 and was ruled by the <strong>Rurik dynasty</strong>. In 1237, the <strong>Mongol invasion</strong> led to the decline of Kievan Rus', and the state was eventually divided into several principalities. The <strong>Grand Duchy of Moscow</strong> emerged as a dominant power in the 14th century and eventually became the center of the <strong>Russian Empire</strong>. The Russian Empire was founded in 1721 and existed until the <strong>Russian Revolution</strong> in 1917. The revolution led to the establishment of the <strong>Soviet Union</strong>, which was a socialist state that existed from 1922 to 1991. Russia gained its independence on December 26, 1991, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Russian Empire</strong> played a significant role in the country's expansion, with the annexation of <strong>Siberia</strong> in the 17th century and the <strong>Crimean War</strong> in the 19th century. The empire also saw the rise of <strong>Russian culture</strong>, with notable figures such as <strong>Tolstoy</strong>, <strong>Dostoevsky</strong>, and <strong>Tchaikovsky</strong>. The <strong>Soviet Union</strong> period saw significant industrialization and urbanization, with the country becoming a major world power. However, the period also saw <strong>Stalin's rule</strong>, which was marked by widespread repression and human rights abuses.</p>
        <p>Russia's <strong>geographic expansion</strong> has been a significant factor in its history, with the country spanning across <strong>Eastern Europe</strong> and <strong>Northern Asia</strong>. The country shares borders with 14 countries, including <strong>Norway</strong>, <strong>Finland</strong>, and <strong>China</strong>. Russia's <strong>natural resources</strong>, including <strong>oil</strong>, <strong>gas</strong>, and <strong>minerals</strong>, have also played a significant role in its economy. The country's <strong>strategic location</strong> has made it an important player in global politics, with Russia being a member of the <strong>United Nations Security Council</strong>.</p>
        <p>Russia's <strong>cultural heritage</strong> is diverse, with the country being home to over 190 ethnic groups. The <strong>Russian language</strong> is the official language, and the country has a rich tradition of <strong>literature</strong>, <strong>music</strong>, and <strong>art</strong>. The country's <strong>historical landmarks</strong>, including the <strong>Kremlin</strong> and <strong>St. Basil's Cathedral</strong>, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Russia's <strong>education system</strong> is highly developed, with the country having a high <strong>literacy rate</strong> and a strong emphasis on <strong>science</strong> and <strong>technology</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Russia is a completely cold and snowy country"</p>
        <p>Reality: While Russia is known for its cold winters, the country has a diverse climate, with <strong>temperate</strong> and <strong>subtropical</strong> regions in the south. The <strong>Black Sea</strong> coast has a mild climate, and the <strong>Caucasus region</strong> has a <strong>subtropical</strong> climate. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All Russians drink vodka"</p>
        <p>Reality: While <strong>vodka</strong> is a popular drink in Russia, not all Russians drink it. In fact, <strong>wine</strong> and <strong>beer</strong> are also popular beverages in the country. Additionally, many Russians prefer <strong>tea</strong> or <strong>coffee</strong> over alcohol. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Russia is a very unsafe country"</p>
        <p>Reality: While Russia has <strong>crime rates</strong> similar to other countries, it is not necessarily an <strong>unsafe</strong> country. Major cities like <strong>Moscow</strong> and <strong>St. Petersburg</strong> have a strong police presence, and tourists can feel safe walking around. However, as with any country, it's essential to take <strong>precautions</strong> and be aware of your surroundings. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Russia is a poor country"</p>
        <p>Reality: Russia has a <strong>mixed economy</strong>, with a strong <strong>energy sector</strong> and a growing <strong>middle class</strong>. The country has a <strong>high GDP</strong> and a <strong>low poverty rate</strong> compared to other countries. However, there are still <strong>income disparities</strong> and <strong>regional inequalities</strong> within the country. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All Russians are communists"</p>
        <p>Reality: While Russia has a <strong>socialist</strong> past, the country has undergone significant <strong>reforms</strong> since the <strong>fall of the Soviet Union</strong>. Today, Russia has a <strong>multi-party system</strong>, and many Russians identify as <strong>conservatives</strong>, <strong>liberals</strong>, or <strong>independents</strong> rather than <strong>communists</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Russia is isolated from the rest of the world"</p>
        <p>Reality: Russia is a member of several <strong>international organizations</strong>, including the <strong>United Nations</strong>, the <strong>G20</strong>, and the <strong>BRICS</strong> grouping. The country has <strong>diplomatic relations</strong> with over 180 countries and is an important player in <strong>global politics</strong> and <strong>economics</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
