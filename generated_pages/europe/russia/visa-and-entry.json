[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nRussia has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Currently, citizens of around 40 countries can enter Russia visa-free, while others need to obtain a visa in advance or on arrival. The country's visa policy is designed to balance national security, economic, and tourism interests. Russia offers various types of visas, including **Tourist**, **Business**, **Student**, and **Work** visas, each with its own set of requirements and restrictions.\n\nThe Russian government has been working to simplify its visa procedures and attract more foreign visitors, particularly tourists and business travelers. In recent years, Russia has introduced an **eVisa** system for citizens of certain countries, allowing them to apply for and receive their visas online. However, the visa application process can still be complex and time-consuming, and requirements may vary depending on the applicant's nationality and purpose of visit.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Must register with the Russian authorities within 7 days of arrival |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Must provide proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Some EU citizens may be eligible for an eVisa |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Must provide proof of sufficient funds |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Must provide proof of onward travel |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Must provide proof of sufficient funds and onward travel |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Must provide proof of onward travel and sufficient funds |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** To enter Russia as a tourist, visitors typically need to provide proof of onward travel, sufficient funds, and health insurance.

When arriving in Russia, visitors will need to go through immigration and customs, where they will need to present their passport, visa (if required), and other documents. The immigration process can be slow, especially during peak travel seasons, so it's a good idea to arrive early and be prepared to wait.

The main land borders are with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. When crossing the border by land, visitors will need to present their passport, visa (if required), and other documents to the border authorities. They will also need to declare any goods they are bringing with them and pay any applicable duties or taxes.\n\n[SECTION] Common Mistakes To Avoid [/SECTION]\n- Not registering with the Russian authorities within the required timeframe\n- Not providing proof of onward travel or sufficient funds\n- Not obtaining the correct type of visa for the purpose of visit\n- Not declaring goods or gifts when arriving in Russia\n- Not having a valid medical insurance certificate\n- Not providing a valid invitation letter or sponsorship documentation",
