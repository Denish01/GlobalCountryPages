Road Network: 1,283,387 km, with 40% paved
Rail Network: 85,500 km
Major Airports: 169
Major Ports: 67
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Russia's infrastructure development level is generally high, with significant investments made in recent years to modernize and expand its transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications. However, there is still a notable urban-rural gap, with cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg enjoying better infrastructure and services compared to rural areas. The government has been actively working to address this disparity through various initiatives and projects. Russia's infrastructure is also heavily influenced by its vast geography, with harsh climate conditions and remote areas posing significant challenges to development and maintenance.

The Russian government has been investing heavily in infrastructure development, with a focus on transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications. These investments have led to significant improvements in the overall quality and accessibility of infrastructure services, particularly in urban areas. However, more work is needed to address the urban-rural gap and ensure that all citizens have access to reliable and modern infrastructure.

Despite the challenges, Russia's infrastructure has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as road quality, rail network expansion, and increased access to electricity and internet services. The government's continued investments and efforts to address the urban-rural gap are expected to further enhance the country's infrastructure development in the coming years.
