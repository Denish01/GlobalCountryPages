[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Russia has an upper-middle income economy, driven primarily by its vast natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas. The country's economic development level is relatively high, with a strong industrial base and a growing services sector. However, the economy has faced challenges in recent years, including a decline in oil prices, international sanctions, and a dependence on commodity exports. Despite these challenges, Russia has made efforts to diversify its economy, invest in infrastructure, and promote innovation and entrepreneurship.

Russia's economy is classified as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The government plays a significant role in the economy, particularly in the energy and defense sectors. The country has a large and skilled workforce, with a high level of education and training. However, the economy has been criticized for its lack of competition, corruption, and bureaucratic barriers to business.

The Russian economy has undergone significant changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with a shift from a planned to a market-based economy. The country has implemented various economic reforms, including privatization, deregulation, and trade liberalization. However, the economy still faces challenges, including a lack of investment in non-commodity sectors, a declining population, and a need to improve its business climate.
