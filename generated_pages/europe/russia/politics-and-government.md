[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Russian government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is directly elected by the people for a six-year term. The president has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the prime minister, dissolve the State Duma, and sign bills into law. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Federal Assembly, which is divided into two chambers: the Federation Council and the State Duma. The Federation Council represents the interests of the regions, while the State Duma is responsible for passing laws. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the law and resolving disputes.

The Russian government is a **federal system**, with power divided between the federal government and the regions. The federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign policy, and economic policy, while the regions have significant autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and local governance. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Russian Constitution, which provides for checks and balances between the three branches of government.

The Russian government has undergone significant changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The country has transitioned from a **unitary state** to a federal system, with the adoption of the 1993 Constitution. The government has also undergone significant reforms, including the introduction of a new electoral system and the establishment of an independent judiciary.
