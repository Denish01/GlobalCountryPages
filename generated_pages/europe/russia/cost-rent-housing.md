[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Russia is relatively competitive, with a wide range of options available in major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month deposit required. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with the law requiring landlords to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to regional neighbors like Norway and Finland, Russia's housing costs are relatively affordable, but still higher than in some Eastern European countries like Poland and Ukraine.

The housing market in Russia has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by government investment in infrastructure and urban development. However, the market is still subject to fluctuations in the economy and global market trends. Expats and foreigners may find it challenging to navigate the rental market, particularly if they do not speak Russian. It is essential to work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable apartment and negotiate a fair price.
