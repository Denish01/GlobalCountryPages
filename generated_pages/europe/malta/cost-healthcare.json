  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Malta can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with the overall health expenditure per capita being $3,623.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $3,623\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 30.9%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMalta has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is available to all citizens and residents, while private healthcare offers more specialized and personalized care. For locals, the public healthcare system is usually the first point of contact, with most services being free or low-cost. However, for foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as public services may not be readily available to non-residents. The healthcare system in Malta is well-regarded, with many medical professionals being trained in the UK or other European countries.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Malta is funded through taxes and is generally considered to be comprehensive, with a wide range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries. However, waiting times can be long, especially for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers more rapid access to services, as well as more personalized care and attention. Many private hospitals and clinics in Malta have international accreditation and offer a high standard of care. It is worth noting that while private health insurance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, to ensure that you have access to the best possible medical care in case of an emergency.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics usually have longer waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Public hospitals may have limited specialist services |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$60 | $60-$150 | Private dental clinics often have more advanced equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have limited eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$60 | Private labs may offer faster test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public hospitals usually have longer waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Private hospitals often have more comfortable rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Public hospitals may have limited surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | Private hospitals often have more personalized care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may have more advanced equipment |\n| X-Ray | $50-$150 | Public hospitals usually have lower costs for basic tests |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public hospital services, doctor visits, basic tests |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private hospital services, specialist consultations, advanced tests |\n| International / Expat | $300-$600 | Worldwide coverage, including Malta, with access to private hospitals and specialists |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **pain relievers** and **antibiotics** can cost between $5-$20 per prescription\n- Prescription rules in Malta are similar to those in other European countries, with most medications requiring a doctor's prescription\n- Pharmacies are widely available in Malta, with many located in urban areas\n- Over-the-counter medications are also readily available, with many pharmacies offering a wide range of products\n- Some medications may be more expensive in Malta than in other countries, so it's a good idea to check prices before purchasing\n- It's also worth noting that some medications may not be available in Malta, so it's a good idea to bring any necessary medications with you when traveling\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the emergency number 112, which will connect you to the local emergency services.
