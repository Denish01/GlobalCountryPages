The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting most towns and villages. Most people get around Malta by using the public bus system, which is operated by Malta Public Transport, or by using taxis and ride-hailing services. The country's small size and relatively low traffic congestion make it easy to navigate, and many people also choose to walk or cycle, especially in the capital city of Valletta.\n\nThe public transportation system in Malta is efficient and affordable, with a comprehensive network of bus routes covering the entire island. The buses are modern and comfortable, and the fares are relatively low. In addition to the public bus system, there are also private bus companies that operate on certain routes, as well as a ferry service that connects the main island to the smaller island of Gozo. The country's roads are generally in good condition, and driving is a viable option, especially for those who prefer to explore the island at their own pace.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1.50 | $26 | Comprehensive coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Malta |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2-$3 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used for short distances |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Malta |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3 | $1.50 | $10-$15 | Available at taxi stands and can be hailed on the street |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2-$3 | $1-$2 | $8-$12 | Bolt and eCabs are popular ride-hailing services in Malta |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic and time of day |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.43 | Unleaded gasoline, prices may vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.35 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, prices may vary depending on season and rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Prices may vary depending on location and time of day |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable in Malta, as there are no toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mainly used for travel to Gozo |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available in Malta, as the island is small and well-connected by bus and ferry |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Malta |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or using ride-hailing services, which can be more affordable than taxis.\n- Use the Malta Public Transport website or app to plan your route and track bus schedules.\n- Be aware that traffic in Malta can be heavy during peak hours, especially during the summer months.\n- When using taxis, make sure to agree on the fare before you start your journey, and consider using a ride-hailing app to avoid any potential disputes.\n- If you plan to drive in Malta, be aware that the country drives on the left-hand side of the road, and consider renting a car with a GPS system to help navigate the island's narrow roads.\n- Consider using the ferry service to travel to Gozo, which can be a more scenic and affordable option than taking the bus or driving.",
