[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Malta has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is available to all citizens and residents, while private healthcare offers more specialized and personalized care. For locals, the public healthcare system is usually the first point of contact, with most services being free or low-cost. However, for foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as public services may not be readily available to non-residents. The healthcare system in Malta is well-regarded, with many medical professionals being trained in the UK or other European countries.

The public healthcare system in Malta is funded through taxes and is generally considered to be comprehensive, with a wide range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries. However, waiting times can be long, especially for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers more rapid access to services, as well as more personalized care and attention. Many private hospitals and clinics in Malta have international accreditation and offer a high standard of care. It is worth noting that while private health insurance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, to ensure that you have access to the best possible medical care in case of an emergency.
