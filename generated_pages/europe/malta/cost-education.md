[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Malta's education system is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on bilingualism, as both Maltese and English are official languages. Public education is generally of high quality and free for locals, with compulsory education spanning from age 5 to 16. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more exclusive learning environment, often with smaller class sizes and a wider range of extracurricular activities. International schools are also available, catering to the growing expat community, with curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the British GCSE.

The language of instruction in public schools is Maltese, while private and international schools often use English as the primary language. This bilingual approach allows students to develop a strong proficiency in both languages, making them highly competitive in the global job market. Malta's education system is also known for its emphasis on **STEM subjects** (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), as well as the arts and humanities. With a wide range of educational institutions to choose from, parents can select the best fit for their child's needs and interests.
