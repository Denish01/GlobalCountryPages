[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Malta's healthcare system is primarily funded through the government, with a universal healthcare system that provides comprehensive medical care to all residents. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and a wide range of medical specialties available. Private healthcare options are also available, and many Maltese residents opt for private health insurance to supplement their public coverage. In urban areas, access to healthcare is generally excellent, with many hospitals and clinics located in or near the capital city of Valletta. However, in rural areas, access to healthcare may be more limited, with fewer hospitals and clinics available.

The quality of care in Malta is generally high, with many medical professionals trained in the UK or other European countries. Malta is also a popular destination for medical tourism, with many foreigners traveling to the country for medical procedures such as orthopedic surgery, cosmetic surgery, and fertility treatments. The country's high standard of healthcare, combined with its warm climate and beautiful scenery, make it an attractive destination for those seeking medical care.

Malta's healthcare system is also well-integrated with the European Union's healthcare system, making it easy for EU residents to access medical care in the country. Non-EU residents, on the other hand, may need to purchase private health insurance or pay out-of-pocket for medical care.
