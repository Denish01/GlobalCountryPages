[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nMalta has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa. Malta is a member of the Schengen Area, which means that it has a uniform visa policy with other Schengen countries. Citizens of over 60 countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia, can enter Malta visa-free for tourism or business purposes for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. However, it's essential to note that visa policies can change, and it's always best to check with the Maltese embassy or consulate for the latest requirements.\n\nMalta's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and tourism while ensuring the security and integrity of the country. The government has implemented various measures to streamline the visa application process, including the introduction of an online application system. Citizens of countries that require a visa can apply for a Schengen visa, which allows them to travel to Malta and other Schengen countries. The visa application process typically involves submitting required documents, paying a fee, and attending an interview at the embassy or consulate.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | Unlimited | Must have a valid passport or national ID card |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Schengen visa | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at the Maltese embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Schengen visa | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at the Maltese embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Malta visa-free for up to 90 days within a 180-day period, provided they have a valid passport with at least six months' validity.
