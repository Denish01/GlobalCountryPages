[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Malta has a well-developed public transportation system, with buses being the primary mode of transport. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting most towns and villages. Most people get around Malta by using the public bus system, which is operated by Malta Public Transport, or by using taxis and ride-hailing services. The country's small size and relatively low traffic congestion make it easy to navigate, and many people also choose to walk or cycle, especially in the capital city of Valletta.

The public transportation system in Malta is efficient and affordable, with a comprehensive network of bus routes covering the entire island. The buses are modern and comfortable, and the fares are relatively low. In addition to the public bus system, there are also private bus companies that operate on certain routes, as well as a ferry service that connects the main island to the smaller island of Gozo. The country's roads are generally in good condition, and driving is a viable option, especially for those who prefer to explore the island at their own pace.
