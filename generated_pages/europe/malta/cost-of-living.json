[/SECTION]\nMalta is a sovereign island nation located in the Mediterranean Sea, with a unique blend of European and North African influences. The cost of living in Malta is generally moderate, with prices comparable to those in other European countries. However, the cost of accommodation and food can be relatively high, especially in popular tourist areas. Compared to its neighbors, Malta is more expensive than Tunisia but less expensive than Italy. Overall, Malta offers a great balance of quality of life, culture, and affordability, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike.\n\nMalta's economy is driven by a mix of industries, including tourism, finance, and manufacturing, which contributes to its moderate cost of living. The country's small size and limited resources also mean that many goods are imported, which can drive up prices. However, the Maltese government has implemented various initiatives to control inflation and maintain a stable economy. As a result, Malta remains an attractive destination for visitors and residents who are looking for a high standard of living at a relatively affordable price.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $20-40 | basic amenities, shared rooms |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $80-150 | comfortable rooms, amenities like pool and gym |\n| Luxury/Resort | $200-400 | high-end amenities, stunning views, and excellent service |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $600-1,200 | city center, 1-2 bedrooms, furnished |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $400-900 | outside city center, 1-2 bedrooms, furnished |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-15 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-60 |\n| Fine Dining | $80-120 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-7 |\n| Coffee | $2-4 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-2 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-3 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 600 | 900 | 1,200 |\n| Food | 300 | 500 | 800 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 150 | 250 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 300 | 500 |\n| **Total** | **1,300** | **2,050** | **3,050** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting Malta during the off-season (October to May) to avoid peak tourist prices.\n- Look for accommodation outside of the city center, where prices are generally lower.\n- Take advantage of Malta's efficient public transportation system, which is affordable and convenient.\n- Eat at local eateries and street food stalls, which offer delicious and affordable meals.\n- Avoid drinking tap water and instead opt for bottled water, which is relatively cheap.\n- Explore Malta's many free attractions, such as its beautiful beaches, historic sites, and vibrant markets.",
