The market is characterized by a mix of old and new properties, with historic townhouses and apartments in Valletta and other urban areas, and modern developments in coastal towns like Sliema and St. Julian's. The price trajectory has been upward, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per year, making Malta an attractive destination for property investors. The urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, with the capital city Valletta being the most sought-after location.\n\nThe market is also influenced by the country's popularity as a tourist destination, with many foreigners buying properties for rental income or as a holiday home. The demand for short-term rentals has driven up prices in popular areas, but there are still opportunities for buyers to find affordable properties in less crowded areas. The government has implemented measures to regulate the market and protect buyers, including the introduction of a property price index and stricter regulations on rental agreements.\n\nThe market is expected to continue growing, driven by Malta's strong economy and its reputation as a hub for financial services, gaming, and technology companies.
