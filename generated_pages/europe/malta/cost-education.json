  "content": "The cost of education in Malta varies depending on the type of institution and the student's residency status, with public education being generally free or subsidized for locals, while private and international schools can range from $5,000 to $20,000 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 4.7%\nLiteracy Rate: 95%\nSchool System: 11 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nMalta's education system is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on bilingualism, as both Maltese and English are official languages. Public education is generally of high quality and free for locals, with compulsory education spanning from age 5 to 16. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more exclusive learning environment, often with smaller class sizes and a wider range of extracurricular activities. International schools are also available, catering to the growing expat community, with curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the British GCSE.\n\nThe language of instruction in public schools is Maltese, while private and international schools often use English as the primary language. This bilingual approach allows students to develop a strong proficiency in both languages, making them highly competitive in the global job market. Malta's education system is also known for its emphasis on **STEM subjects** (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), as well as the arts and humanities. With a wide range of educational institutions to choose from, parents can select the best fit for their child's needs and interests.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, bilingual instruction |\n| Private Primary | $5,000-$10,000 | Smaller class sizes, extracurricular activities |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Wide range of subjects, including vocational training |\n| Private Secondary | $8,000-$15,000 | Exclusive learning environment, university preparation |\n| International School | $10,000-$20,000 | IB or British curriculum, international student body |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000-$2,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | University of Malta, wide range of programs |\n| Private University | $8,000-$12,000 | $12,000-$18,000 | American University of Malta, business and humanities programs |\n| Top-Ranked University | $10,000-$15,000 | $15,000-$20,000 | University of Malta, **engineering and computer science** programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Limited availability, high demand |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $30-$50 | Wide range of subjects, experienced tutors |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | English, Maltese, or other languages, group or individual classes |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100-$200 | Basic materials, textbooks, and equipment |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Mandatory for most schools, simple and practical design |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The University of Malta is the top-ranked institution in the country, offering a wide range of programs in **engineering**, **computer science**, and the humanities.\n- International schools in Malta offer a high-quality education, with a focus on **bilingualism** and **cultural exchange**.\n- Expats can choose from a variety of schools, including the Verdala International School and the Malta International School.\n- Scholarships are available for local and international students, covering tuition fees and living expenses.\n- Online learning options are limited, but some universities offer **distance learning** programs for certain subjects.\n- Education in Malta is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on **critical thinking**, **problem-solving**, and **communication skills**.",
