        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Malta, an island nation located in the Mediterranean Sea, has a rich and diverse history dating back to around 5900 BC. The first inhabitants of Malta were <strong>Neolithic farmers</strong> who migrated from the Italian mainland. The islands were later colonized by the <strong>Phoenicians</strong> in around 700 BC, followed by the <strong>Carthaginians</strong>, and then the <strong>Romans</strong> in 218 BC. Malta remained under Roman rule until the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD.</p>
        <p>In 1090, Malta was conquered by the <strong>Normans</strong>, who introduced the <strong>Feudal system</strong> to the islands. The Knights of St. John, also known as the <strong>Knights Hospitaller</strong>, took control of Malta in 1530 and ruled the islands for over 250 years. During this period, the Knights built many of the <strong>fortifications</strong> and <strong>cathedrals</strong> that still stand today. In 1798, Malta was occupied by <strong>Napoleon's forces</strong>, but the Maltese people rebelled against the French and asked for British protection.</p>
        <p>Malta became a <strong>British colony</strong> in 1813 and remained under British rule until it gained <strong>independence</strong> on September 21, 1964. The country became a <strong>republic</strong> on December 13, 1974, with the President serving as head of state. Malta joined the <strong>European Union</strong> in 2004 and adopted the <strong>Euro</strong> as its currency in 2008.</p>
        <p>Malta's strategic location in the Mediterranean has made it an important location for trade and military activities throughout its history. The country's unique cultural heritage is a reflection of its diverse history, with influences from the <strong>Phoenicians</strong>, <strong>Romans</strong>, <strong>Knights of St. John</strong>, and <strong>British</strong>. Today, Malta is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> with a population of around 0.54 million people, with <strong>Maltese</strong> and <strong>English</strong> as the official languages.</p>
