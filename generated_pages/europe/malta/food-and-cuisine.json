The country's culinary heritage is characterized by the use of fresh ingredients, such as tomatoes, garlic, and olive oil, which are often combined with local specialties like rabbit and seafood. Malta's food culture is also shaped by its history, with many traditional dishes dating back to the Knights of St. John, who introduced new ingredients and cooking techniques to the island. Regional variations are evident in the different types of cuisine found in various parts of the island, such as the more rustic, farm-to-table cooking in the countryside and the more sophisticated, seafood-based dishes in coastal towns.\n\nMalta's culinary scene is also influenced by its cultural festivals and traditions, which often feature traditional foods and drinks. For example, the **Festa** celebrations, which take place throughout the summer months, typically include traditional Maltese dishes like Fenkata and **Lampuki**, a type of fish that is abundant in Maltese waters during the summer months. The country's food culture is also shaped by its strong Catholic heritage, with many traditional dishes and desserts being associated with specific saints' days and festivals.\n\nIn recent years, Malta's food scene has experienced a significant revival, with many new restaurants and cafes opening up, particularly in the capital city of Valletta. This has led to a greater emphasis on modern, creative cuisine, with many chefs incorporating traditional Maltese ingredients and techniques into innovative, contemporary dishes. Despite this, traditional Maltese cuisine remains an essential part of the country's cultural identity, with many locals continuing to prepare and enjoy traditional dishes in their homes and in local restaurants.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fenkata | Stew | Traditional rabbit stew with vegetables and herbs | Rural restaurants and town festivals |\n| Lampuki Pie | Savory Pie | Flaky pastry filled with lampuki fish, onions, and tomatoes | Coastal restaurants and markets |\n| Arancini | Fried Rice Balls | Stuffed with meat, cheese, and tomato sauce, then fried | Street food stalls and cafes |\n| Aljotta | Soup | Hearty fish soup with vegetables and aromatic spices | Seafood restaurants and coastal towns |\n| Bigilla | Dip | Traditional bean dip made with broad beans and garlic | Markets and food stalls |\n| Gbejniet | Cheese | Small, sour cheese made from sheep's or goat's milk | Rural markets and specialty shops |\n| Imqaret | Pastry | Date cakes filled with dates, nuts, and spices | Bakeries and cafes |\n| Qaghaq tal-Ghasel | Pastry | Sweet, flaky pastry filled with treacle and aniseed | Bakeries and cafes |\n| Bragioli | Beef Dish | Thinly sliced beef, rolled and stuffed with bacon and herbs | Fine dining restaurants and special occasions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Pastizzi**: Flaky pastry filled with ricotta or peas and ham, typically costs $2-$3\n- **Arancini**: Fried rice balls filled with meat, cheese, and tomato sauce, typically costs $3-$4\n- **Hobz biz-zejt**: Crusty bread dipped in olive oil, typically costs $1-$2\n- **Gbejniet**: Small, sour cheese made from sheep's or goat's milk, typically costs $5-$6\n- **Imqaret**: Date cakes filled with dates, nuts, and spices, typically costs $2-$3\n- **Qaghaq tal-Ghasel**: Sweet, flaky pastry filled with treacle and aniseed, typically costs $2-$3\n- **Kannoli**: Fried pastry shells filled with sweet ricotta cheese, typically costs $3-$4\n- **Zalzett tal-Malti**: Traditional Maltese sausage, typically costs $5-$6\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Kinnie**: A bitter, sweet soft drink made from bitter oranges, typically costs $2-$3\n- **Cisk**: A local lager beer, typically costs $3-$4\n- **Hopleaf**: A local pale ale beer, typically costs $3-$4\n- **Maltese wine**: A range of white, red, and rosé wines made from local grapes, typically costs $10-$20 per bottle\n- **Freshly squeezed orange juice**: Made from local oranges, typically costs $3-$4\n- **Te fit-Tazza**: A strong, sweet tea made with black tea and aniseed, typically costs $2-$3\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Table manners are generally formal, with an emphasis on using napkins and not speaking with your mouth full\n- Tipping is customary, with 5-10% of the total bill being the norm\n- Reservations are recommended for fine dining restaurants, particularly on weekends and during peak season\n- Dress codes vary, but smart casual is generally the norm for most restaurants\n- Meal times are typically observed, with breakfast being served from 7:30-9:30 am, lunch from 12:30-2:30 pm, and dinner from 7:30-10:00 pm\n- It is customary to greet the waiter or waitress with a smile and a hello, and to thank them when leaving the restaurant\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Markets**: Such as the Marsaxlokk market, which offers a range of traditional Maltese dishes and fresh produce\n- **Food courts**: Such as the one in the Bay Street shopping complex, which offers a range of international and local cuisine\n- **Restaurants**: Such as those in the capital city of Valletta, which offer a range of fine dining and casual options\n- **Cafes**: Such as those in the town of Sliema, which offer a range of coffee, pastries, and light meals\n- **Street food stalls**: Such as those in the town of Paceville, which offer a range of traditional Maltese snacks and drinks\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Marsaxlokk market**: A bustling market in the south of the island, offering a range of traditional Maltese dishes and fresh produce\n- **Valletta food tour**: A guided tour of the capital city's culinary scene, including visits to local restaurants, markets, and food stalls\n- **Maltese cooking class**: A hands-on cooking class where participants can learn how to prepare traditional Maltese dishes\n- **Wine tasting**: A wine tasting experience at a local winery, offering a range of Maltese wines and cheeses\n- **Festa celebrations**: A traditional Maltese festival, featuring live music, dancing, and a range of traditional foods and drinks",
