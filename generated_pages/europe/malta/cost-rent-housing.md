[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Malta is highly competitive, with a high demand for apartments and houses, particularly in the city center and surrounding areas. Typical lease terms in Malta range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and tenants are entitled to a written contract outlining the terms and conditions of the lease. Malta's housing costs are relatively high compared to its regional neighbors, such as Italy and Tunisia, due to its small size and limited availability of housing.

The Maltese government has implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights, including the introduction of a rent regulation board and stricter laws on eviction. However, the demand for housing continues to outstrip supply, driving up prices and making it challenging for renters to find affordable accommodation. Expats and foreigners are often willing to pay a premium for high-quality accommodation in desirable locations, which has contributed to the high cost of rent in Malta.
