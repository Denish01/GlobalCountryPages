[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Malta is easily accessible by air, with Malta International Airport (MLA) being the main entry point for most visitors. The airport is located about 5 miles southwest of Valletta, the capital city, and offers direct flights to many European cities, including London, Rome, and Amsterdam. You can also fly into Malta from other international hubs, such as Dubai or Istanbul, with a layover. If you're traveling from nearby Italy or Tunisia, you can also take a ferry to Malta, which can be a more leisurely and scenic option.

If you're planning to visit Malta from outside of Europe, you may need to fly into a major European hub first and then connect to a flight to Malta. Some airlines, such as Air Malta, offer direct flights from certain cities, but it's often more convenient to book a flight with a layover. Malta International Airport is a relatively small airport, making it easy to navigate and find your way to your next destination. You can take a taxi or bus from the airport to your accommodation, or rent a car and drive yourself.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Malta has a limited domestic air network, with no scheduled flights between the main island and the smaller islands of Gozo and Comino. However, you can take a ferry or a helicopter to get to these islands. If you're planning to visit Gozo or Comino, it's best to take a ferry from the town of Cirkewwa, which is located on the northern coast of Malta. The ferry ride takes about 25 minutes and offers stunning views of the surrounding islands. You can book your ferry tickets in advance online or at the ferry terminal.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Malta has no rail network, so you won't be able to take a train to get around the islands. However, the bus network is extensive and reliable, making it a convenient option for traveling between towns and villages. You can also take a taxi or rent a car to get around, which can be more expensive but offers more flexibility.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
The bus network in Malta is operated by Malta Public Transport, which offers an extensive network of routes that cover most towns and villages. You can take a bus from Valletta to other major towns, such as Mdina, Rabat, and Sliema, as well as to the airport and the ferry terminal. The buses are modern and comfortable, and the fares are relatively low, making it a convenient option for travelers on a budget. You can pay your fare in cash or use a rechargeable card, which can be purchased at most newsagents and convenience stores.
