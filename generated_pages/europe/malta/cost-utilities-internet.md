Malta has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with most homes connected to the national grid for electricity, water, and gas. The cost of utilities in Malta is generally stable, with minor fluctuations due to seasonal variations. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the summer months when air conditioning is used more frequently. The Maltese government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote renewable energy sources, which may impact utility costs in the long term.
