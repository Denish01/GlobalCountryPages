Typical lease terms in Malta range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and tenants are entitled to a written contract outlining the terms and conditions of the lease. Malta's housing costs are relatively high compared to its regional neighbors, such as Italy and Tunisia, due to its small size and limited availability of housing.\n\nThe Maltese government has implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights, including the introduction of a rent regulation board and stricter laws on eviction. However, the demand for housing continues to outstrip supply, driving up prices and making it challenging for renters to find affordable accommodation. Expats and foreigners are often willing to pay a premium for high-quality accommodation in desirable locations, which has contributed to the high cost of rent in Malta.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $900-$1,400 | $600-$1,000 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,400 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,800 | $1,200-$2,000 | family size, amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $1,800-$3,000 | spacious, luxury finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $4,000-$6,000 | prime locations, historic buildings |\n| Suburbs | $2,500-$4,000 | residential areas, amenities |\n| Rural | $1,500-$2,500 | countryside, village locations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Sliema: $1,000-$1,800 per month, modern apartments, amenities, and sea views\n- Valletta: $1,200-$2,500 per month, historic buildings, cultural attractions, and city center location\n- St. Julian's: $1,000-$2,000 per month, lively nightlife, restaurants, and bars\n- Gzira: $800-$1,600 per month, residential area, parks, and waterfront promenade\n- Swieqi: $900-$1,800 per month, family-friendly, amenities, and countryside views\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Malta [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your housing search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find suitable accommodation\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease, and take photos and notes\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, if possible\n- Be aware of scams and fake listings, and never pay a deposit without a signed contract\n- Utilities such as water, electricity, and internet are usually not included in the rent, and tenants are responsible for setting up and paying for these services.",
