[SECTION] Overview: Malta vs Tunisia [/SECTION]
Malta and Tunisia are two distinct countries with different economic contexts, which significantly impact their cost of living. Malta, a European island nation, has a high standard of living and a strong economy, driven by tourism, financial services, and manufacturing. In contrast, Tunisia, a North African country, has a more developing economy, with a mix of industries such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. As a result, Malta tends to have higher prices for goods and services, particularly in areas like housing, food, and transportation. On the other hand, Tunisia offers a more affordable lifestyle, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a lower cost of living.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Malta's strong economy and high standard of living have led to a higher demand for goods and services, resulting in higher prices. In contrast, Tunisia's developing economy and lower demand for goods and services have kept prices relatively low. Additionally, the exchange rate between the Euro (used in Malta) and the Tunisian dinar can also impact the cost of living for foreigners. Overall, while Malta offers a high standard of living and a unique cultural experience, Tunisia provides a more affordable alternative for those looking to stretch their budget.
