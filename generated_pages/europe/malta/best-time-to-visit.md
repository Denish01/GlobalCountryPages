[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Malta has a **Mediterranean climate**, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The country experiences two main seasons: a dry season from May to October, and a wet season from November to April. The dry season is marked by high temperatures and low humidity, while the wet season is characterized by mild temperatures and occasional rainfall. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season coinciding with the dry season, and the budget season coinciding with the wet season.

The climate in Malta is influenced by its **island location**, with the sea temperature playing a significant role in regulating the temperature. The **northern winds** bring cool air from Europe, while the **southern winds** bring warm air from Africa. This unique combination of winds creates a mild climate, making Malta an attractive destination for tourists.

The seasons also affect the **tourist infrastructure**, with many hotels, restaurants, and attractions closing or reducing their hours during the off-season. However, this can also be a great opportunity to explore the island without the crowds and at a lower cost. Visitors can take advantage of the **shoulder season**, which falls in the spring and autumn, to enjoy mild weather and smaller crowds.
