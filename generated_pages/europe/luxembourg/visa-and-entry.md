# Luxembourg Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Luxembourg before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Luxembourg has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens from over 60 countries to enter visa-free. The country is a member of the Schengen Area, which means that visitors can travel to Luxembourg and other Schengen countries with a single visa. The visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade while maintaining national security and immigration control. As a result, Luxembourg's visa requirements are relatively straightforward, but it's essential to understand the specific requirements for your nationality and travel purpose.

The country's visa-free policy applies to citizens of countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, among others. These visitors can stay in Luxembourg for up to 90 days within a 180-day period without a visa. However, citizens of other countries may need to apply for a visa before entering Luxembourg. It's crucial to check the official government website or consult with the embassy or consulate of Luxembourg to determine the specific visa requirements for your nationality.
