[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Luxembourg's infrastructure is characterized by a high level of development, with significant investments in recent years to improve and expand its transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications. The country's strategic location at the heart of Europe, bordered by Belgium, France, and Germany, has made it an important hub for trade and commerce. However, there is a notable urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with the capital city Luxembourg City and other urban areas generally having better access to amenities and services than rural areas. The government has been working to address this gap through various initiatives, including the development of rural broadband networks and the improvement of public transportation links between urban and rural areas.

Despite these efforts, the urban-rural divide remains a challenge, with rural areas often facing difficulties in accessing certain services, such as high-speed internet and public transportation. To address this issue, the government has launched several initiatives, including the creation of a national broadband plan, which aims to provide high-speed internet access to all rural areas by 2025. Additionally, the government has invested in the development of public transportation links between urban and rural areas, including the expansion of bus and train networks.

The country's infrastructure development has been driven by a combination of public and private investments, with a focus on sustainability and environmental protection. Luxembourg has set ambitious targets to reduce its carbon footprint and increase the use of renewable energy sources, and has implemented various measures to promote energy efficiency and reduce waste. For example, the government has introduced a range of incentives to encourage the use of electric vehicles, including tax breaks and investment in charging infrastructure.
