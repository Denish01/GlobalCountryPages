[SECTION] How Luxembourg Is Divided [/SECTION]
Luxembourg is divided into 12 cantons, which are further divided into 102 communes. The cantons are not directly involved in the administration of the country, but rather serve as electoral districts. The communes, on the other hand, have a significant amount of autonomy and are responsible for providing various local services to their residents. The country is also divided into three districts: Luxembourg, Diekirch, and Grevenmacher, although these districts do not have any administrative powers.

The administrative structure of Luxembourg is designed to provide a high level of local autonomy, with the communes having a significant amount of control over local affairs. This allows for a more personalized and responsive approach to governance, with local officials being more accountable to their constituents. The country's small size and relatively simple administrative structure also make it easier for citizens to access government services and participate in the decision-making process.

The country is also easily accessible by car, with a modern highway system that links the major cities and connects to the neighboring countries.
