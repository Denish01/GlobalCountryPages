[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Luxembourg's healthcare system is based on a social security model, where everyone is required to have health insurance, and the government provides subsidies to those who cannot afford it. The system is divided into two main parts: public and private. The public system provides comprehensive coverage for most medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions, while the private system offers additional services such as dental care and alternative therapies. The quality of care in Luxembourg is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. Urban areas, such as Luxembourg City, have a higher concentration of medical facilities and specialists, while rural areas have fewer options, but the government has implemented measures to improve access to healthcare in these areas.

The healthcare system in Luxembourg is also characterized by a high degree of patient autonomy, with patients having the freedom to choose their own doctors and hospitals. This has led to a high level of competition among healthcare providers, which has driven up quality and driven down costs. Additionally, Luxembourg has a strong focus on preventive care, with regular check-ups and screenings encouraged for all citizens.

Overall, Luxembourg's healthcare system is designed to provide comprehensive, high-quality care to all citizens and residents, regardless of their income or social status. The system is well-organized, efficient, and widely accessible, making it an attractive option for foreigners and expats.
