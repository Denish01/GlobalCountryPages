[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Luxembourg is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the Grand Duke, who serves as the head of state, and the Prime Minister, who is the head of government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral parliament with 60 seats. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the District Courts. Luxembourg has a **unitary system**, where the central government has the primary authority to make and enforce laws.

The **separation of powers** is an essential aspect of Luxembourg's political system, ensuring that no single branch of government has too much power. The Grand Duke serves as a symbol of national unity, while the Prime Minister and the government are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the country. The Chamber of Deputies has the power to pass laws, approve the government's budget, and exercise parliamentary control over the government.

Luxembourg's **parliamentary system** is based on the principle of representative democracy, where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The government is accountable to the Chamber of Deputies, and the Prime Minister must maintain the confidence of the parliament to remain in office. This system provides a high degree of stability and accountability, allowing for effective governance and decision-making.
