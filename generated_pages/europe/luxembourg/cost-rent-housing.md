[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Luxembourg's rental market is highly competitive, with a high demand for housing, particularly in the city center. The typical lease term in Luxembourg is 3-5 years, with a 2-3 month deposit required. Tenant rights are well-protected in Luxembourg, with the law favoring the tenant in cases of disputes. Compared to its regional neighbors, Luxembourg's housing costs are among the highest, with prices similar to those in major cities in Belgium and Germany. However, the country's high standard of living and excellent education system make it an attractive destination for expats and families.

The housing market in Luxembourg is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a focus on modernizing and renovating existing properties. The government has implemented measures to increase the supply of housing, including the development of new neighborhoods and the renovation of existing buildings. However, the demand for housing remains high, particularly in the city center, where prices can be steep. Expats and foreigners may find it challenging to find affordable housing, particularly in the city center, and may need to consider living in the suburbs or surrounding areas.
