The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and skilled medical professionals, while private healthcare offers more personalized services and shorter waiting times. For locals, the healthcare system is largely subsidized by the government, with most medical expenses reimbursed by the state. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance, as medical costs can be high, and not all services are covered by the public system.\n\nThe healthcare system in Luxembourg is designed to provide comprehensive coverage to all residents, with a range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and specialist consultations. However, the system can be complex, and navigating it can be challenging, especially for foreigners. It is essential to have a good understanding of the system and to have adequate health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses. In Luxembourg, health insurance is mandatory for all residents, and there are various options available, including basic local insurance, comprehensive private insurance, and international insurance plans.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Appointment required |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Referral from GP required |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Private dentists offer more services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists offer more services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Available at public and private labs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public hospitals offer emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Private hospitals offer more amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Public and private hospitals offer surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Public and private hospitals offer maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$1,000 | Private clinics offer more advanced imaging services |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Public and private hospitals offer radiology services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $100-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $300-$1,000 | Specialist consultations, advanced medical services, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $500-$2,000 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary from $5 to $50 per prescription, depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.\n- Over-the-counter medication prices range from $5 to $20 per item, depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.\n- Prescription rules are strict, and most medication requires a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- Pharmacies are widely available, with many locations throughout the country, including in major cities and towns.\n- Medication prices are generally higher in private pharmacies than in public pharmacies.\n- Some medication may require a special import permit, which can increase the cost and delay the delivery.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 112, which is available 24/7.
