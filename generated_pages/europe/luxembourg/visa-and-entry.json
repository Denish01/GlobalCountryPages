[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nLuxembourg has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens from over 60 countries to enter visa-free. The country is a member of the Schengen Area, which means that visitors can travel to Luxembourg and other Schengen countries with a single visa. The visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade while maintaining national security and immigration control. As a result, Luxembourg's visa requirements are relatively straightforward, but it's essential to understand the specific requirements for your nationality and travel purpose.\n\nThe country's visa-free policy applies to citizens of countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, among others. These visitors can stay in Luxembourg for up to 90 days within a 180-day period without a visa. However, citizens of other countries may need to apply for a visa before entering Luxembourg. It's crucial to check the official government website or consult with the embassy or consulate of Luxembourg to determine the specific visa requirements for your nationality.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No visa required for tourism or business stays up to 90 days |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No visa required for tourism or business stays up to 90 days, but may need to show proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | No | Free Movement | Unlimited | EU citizens have the right to free movement and residence in Luxembourg |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No visa required for tourism or business stays up to 90 days |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No visa required for tourism or business stays up to 90 days |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Schengen Visa | 90 days | Must apply for a Schengen visa at the Luxembourg embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Schengen Visa | 90 days | Must apply for a Schengen visa at the Luxembourg embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Luxembourg without a visa if they meet the visa-free requirements.
