Luxembourgish, also known as Lëtzebuergesch, is a West Central German language that is spoken by around 400,000 people, mostly in Luxembourg. French and German are also widely spoken, and many Luxembourgers speak four or five languages, including English, which is often used in business and international communication. There are also several regional dialects, such as Moselle Franconian and Luxembourgish, which are spoken in different parts of the country. Additionally, there are several minority languages, including Portuguese, which is spoken by around 20% of the population, and Italian, which is spoken by around 5% of the population.\n\nThe use of language in Luxembourg can vary depending on the region and the context. For example, in the north of the country, German is more widely spoken, while in the south, French is more dominant. In the capital city, Luxembourg City, all three official languages are widely spoken, and many signs and official documents are translated into all three languages. English is also widely understood, especially among the younger population and in the service industry, making it relatively easy for tourists to communicate and navigate the country.\n\nLuxembourg's linguistic diversity is reflected in its education system, where students are required to learn multiple languages from a young age. This has contributed to the country's high level of linguistic competence and has made it an attractive destination for international businesses and organizations. Overall, Luxembourg's unique linguistic landscape is a key aspect of its culture and identity, and it continues to play an important role in the country's economic and social development.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Äddi | AH-dee | informal |\n| Hello | Wëllkomm | VELL-kohm | formal |\n| Thank you | Merci | MER-see |  |\n| Please | Wëll | VELL |  |\n| Yes / No | Jo / Neen | YOH / NAYN |  |\n| Excuse me | Äntschëlleg | AHNT-shlayg |  |\n| How much? | Wéi vill? | VAY VILL |  |\n| Where is...? | Wou ass...? | VOO AHSS |  |\n| I don't understand | Ech versteet net | AYKH VER-stayt NET |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Schwätzt dir Englesch? | SHVAYTST DIR AYNG-lehsh |  |\n| Help! | Hëllef! | HELL-ef |  |\n| Goodbye | Äddi | AH-dee | informal |\n| Sorry | Äntschëlleg | AHNT-shlayg |  |\n| How are you? | Wéi geet et? | VAY GAYT ET |  |\n| What's your name? | Wat ass deen Numm? | VAHT AHSS DAYN NOOM |  |\n| I'm lost | Ech sinn verluer | AYKH ZIN VER-loo-er |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Eent | AYNT |\n| 2 | Zwei | ZWAY |\n| 3 | Drei | DRAY |\n| 4 | Véier | FAY-er |\n| 5 | Fënf | FENF |\n| 6 | Sechs | ZAKS |\n| 7 | Siwen | SEE-ven |\n| 8 | Aacht | AHKHT |\n| 9 | Néng | NAYNG |\n| 10 | Zéng | ZAYNG |\n| 100 | Honnert | HOHN-ert |\n| 1000 | Dausend | DOW-zent |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it's customary to use formal titles such as **Herr** or **Frau** until you're explicitly invited to use first names.\n- Luxembourgers tend to be formal and polite, so it's a good idea to use **please** and **thank you** frequently.\n- When speaking to someone who is older or in a position of authority, use the formal **you** (**dir**) instead of the informal **you** (**du**).\n- Avoid using **Luxembourgish** and **German** interchangeably, as this can be seen as insensitive to the country's unique linguistic identity.\n- If you need help, don't hesitate to ask, and be prepared to use a combination of languages to communicate.\n- When interacting with service staff, such as waiters or shop assistants, be prepared to use **French** or **German**, as these languages are widely spoken in the service industry.\n- Be mindful of nonverbal communication, such as body language and gestures, as these can vary significantly across cultures.\n- When communicating with locals, be patient and don't be afraid to ask for clarification if you don't understand something.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The **Google Translate** app is a useful tool for translating text and speech in real-time.\n- **iTranslate** is another popular translation app that offers a range of features, including offline mode and verb conjugation.\n- **Luxembourgish** language courses are available online, such as **Duolingo**, which offers a comprehensive introduction to the language.\n- **Phrasebooks** and **dictionaries** are also available for purchase, and can be a useful resource for travelers who want to learn more about the language and culture.\n- For more advanced learners, **language exchange websites** such as **Tandem** and **HelloTalk** offer a platform to practice speaking and writing with native speakers.",
