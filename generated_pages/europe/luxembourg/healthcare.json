  "content": "Luxembourg has a high-quality, universal healthcare system that provides comprehensive coverage to its citizens and residents, with a strong network of hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, as well as a range of health insurance options.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: Excellent\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Excellent\nInsurance Required: required\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nLuxembourg's healthcare system is based on a social security model, where everyone is required to have health insurance, and the government provides subsidies to those who cannot afford it. The system is divided into two main parts: public and private. The public system provides comprehensive coverage for most medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions, while the private system offers additional services such as dental care and alternative therapies. The quality of care in Luxembourg is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. Urban areas, such as Luxembourg City, have a higher concentration of medical facilities and specialists, while rural areas have fewer options, but the government has implemented measures to improve access to healthcare in these areas.\n\nThe healthcare system in Luxembourg is also characterized by a high degree of patient autonomy, with patients having the freedom to choose their own doctors and hospitals. This has led to a high level of competition among healthcare providers, which has driven up quality and driven down costs. Additionally, Luxembourg has a strong focus on preventive care, with regular check-ups and screenings encouraged for all citizens.\n\nOverall, Luxembourg's healthcare system is designed to provide comprehensive, high-quality care to all citizens and residents, regardless of their income or social status. The system is well-organized, efficient, and widely accessible, making it an attractive option for foreigners and expats.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg | Luxembourg City | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Clinique Saint-Ferreck | Luxembourg City | Private | Orthopedics, neurology, oncology | Yes |\n| Hôpital Kirchberg | Luxembourg City | Public | Pediatrics, obstetrics, gynecology | Yes |\n| Centre Médical de Bereldange | Bereldange | Private | General medicine, dermatology, ophthalmology | Yes |\n| Hôpital de Dudelange | Dudelange | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Limited |\n| Clinique D'Eye | Eye | Private | Ophthalmology, ENT, plastic surgery | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **National Health Insurance** is mandatory for all residents, and provides comprehensive coverage for most medical services\n- **Private health insurance** is also available, and can provide additional coverage for services such as dental care and alternative therapies\n- **Expats** can purchase private health insurance, or opt for a **European Health Insurance Card** (EHIC) if they are from an EU country\n- The cost of health insurance in Luxembourg is generally high, but the quality of care is excellent\n- **Supplementary insurance** is also available, which can provide additional coverage for services such as vision and dental care\n- **Mutual insurance** is a type of insurance that is offered by some employers, and can provide additional coverage for employees and their families\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are widely available in Luxembourg, and can be found in pharmacies, hospitals, and some supermarkets\n- A **prescription** is required for most medications, and can be obtained from a doctor or other medical professional\n- **Common brands** of medications are available in Luxembourg, including international brands and generic alternatives\n- The cost of medications in Luxembourg is generally high, but some medications are subsidized by the government\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also available, and can be purchased without a prescription\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Measles, mumps, and rubella** vaccinations are required for all children\n- **Flu vaccinations** are recommended for all adults, especially those over 65 or with certain health conditions\n- **Hepatitis A and B** vaccinations are recommended for travelers to certain countries\n- **Tick-borne illnesses** such as Lyme disease are common in Luxembourg, especially in rural areas\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Luxembourg, but it is recommended to drink bottled or filtered water\n- **Food safety** is also generally good in Luxembourg, but it is recommended to avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Luxembourg is a popular destination for **medical tourism**, especially for procedures such as orthopedic surgery and oncology\n- **Accredited hospitals** such as the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg and the Clinique Saint-Ferreck offer high-quality care to international patients\n- The cost of medical care in Luxembourg is generally high, but the quality of care is excellent\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for certain procedures, especially when compared to the US or other Western countries\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, call 112 or visit the nearest hospital\n- **Ambulance services** are widely available, and can be called by dialing 112\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by searching online or asking a local\n- **Insurance claims** can be filed with your insurance provider, and may require documentation such as a doctor's note or hospital records\n- **Language barriers** can be a challenge in emergency situations, but many medical professionals in Luxembourg speak English or other languages.",
