[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Luxembourg is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on multilingualism and academic excellence. Public education is generally free or subsidized for local students, and the quality is considered to be very high. However, the language of instruction can be a challenge for international students, as it is typically in Luxembourgish, French, or German. Compulsory education lasts for 12 years, and students can attend public or private schools. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British curriculum.

The public education system in Luxembourg is well-funded and well-organized, with a focus on providing students with a broad-based education that includes languages, sciences, and humanities. Private schools, on the other hand, often have a more specialized focus, such as international curricula or Montessori methods. International schools are a popular option for expat families, as they offer a familiar curriculum and language of instruction. However, these schools can be quite expensive, and places may be limited.
