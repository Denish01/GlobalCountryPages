[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
San Marino's food prices are influenced by its proximity to Italy and the country's high standard of living. The cost of living in San Marino is relatively high, and food prices are no exception. Eating out is a popular culture in San Marino, with many restaurants offering a range of Italian and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also common, and many locals prefer to buy fresh ingredients from local markets or supermarkets to prepare meals at home. The country's limited land area and lack of agricultural production mean that many food items are imported, which can drive up prices.

The high GDP per capita and low inflation rate in San Marino contribute to a stable and prosperous economy, which in turn affects food prices. The country's health expenditure per capita is also relatively high, which may influence the demand for high-quality and nutritious food. Overall, food prices in San Marino are higher than in some neighboring countries, but the quality and variety of food available are generally high. Consumers can expect to pay a premium for imported and high-end products, while local staples and traditional dishes may be more affordable.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of food items can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in San Marino. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported and high-end items, but prices can be higher than at local markets. Local markets, on the other hand, often sell fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices. Consumers can expect to save around 10-20% by buying from local markets, especially for items like fruits, vegetables, and cheeses. However, the quality and variety of products may be lower at local markets, and bargaining is not typically expected.

When shopping at local markets, consumers can find good value in traditional products like **piadina** (a type of flatbread) and **formaggio** (local cheese). These items are often priced lower than at supermarkets and can be a great way to experience the local cuisine. On the other hand, imported and high-end products are often only available at supermarkets, and prices can be higher. Consumers should be aware of the prices and quality of products before making a purchase, and consider shopping at both supermarkets and local markets to get the best value.
