[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
San Marino has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and skilled medical professionals. Locals and foreigners can access public healthcare services, but foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for some services. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a range of specialized services, including private hospitals and clinics, and are generally more expensive than public providers.

The healthcare system in San Marino is designed to provide comprehensive care to all residents, regardless of their income or social status. However, the quality of care can vary depending on the provider and the location. In general, public hospitals are well-equipped and offer a wide range of services, including emergency care, surgery, and specialized treatments. Private hospitals and clinics, on the other hand, may offer more specialized services, such as cosmetic surgery or rehabilitation programs. It is recommended that foreigners have health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.
