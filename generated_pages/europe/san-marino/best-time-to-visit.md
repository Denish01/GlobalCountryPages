[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
San Marino has a **Mediterranean climate**, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The country's small size and location in the Apennine Mountains means that the climate can vary significantly depending on the elevation and location. The higher elevations tend to be cooler and wetter than the lower areas, while the coastal regions are generally warmer and drier. The **dry season** typically runs from May to September, with very little rainfall during these months. In contrast, the **wet season** runs from October to April, with the most significant rainfall occurring in November and December. The seasons can significantly affect travel in San Marino, with the peak summer season being the busiest and most expensive time to visit.

The spring and autumn seasons are ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking and sightseeing, as the weather is mild and pleasant. The summer months can be quite hot, especially in the lower elevations, while the winter months can be cool and wet. The country's many festivals and events are also an important consideration when planning a visit, as they can attract large crowds and drive up prices. Overall, the best time to visit San Marino depends on your individual preferences and interests, but the spring and autumn seasons are generally the most popular and enjoyable times to visit.

San Marino's unique location and climate also mean that the country is susceptible to **fog** and **mist**, especially in the higher elevations. This can make for some beautiful and atmospheric scenery, but it can also make it difficult to navigate the country's narrow roads and streets. Visitors should be prepared for changing weather conditions, especially during the winter months, and should plan accordingly.
