The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and skilled medical professionals. Locals and foreigners can access public healthcare services, but foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for some services. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a range of specialized services, including private hospitals and clinics, and are generally more expensive than public providers.\n\nThe healthcare system in San Marino is designed to provide comprehensive care to all residents, regardless of their income or social status. However, the quality of care can vary depending on the provider and the location. In general, public hospitals are well-equipped and offer a wide range of services, including emergency care, surgery, and specialized treatments. Private hospitals and clinics, on the other hand, may offer more specialized services, such as cosmetic surgery or rehabilitation programs. It is recommended that foreigners have health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$250 | $250-$500 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Eye Exam | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $200-$500 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $2,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $3,000-$6,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $500-$1,500 | Specialist consultations, advanced procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $1,000-$3,000 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $10-$50 per month, depending on the type and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available and can cost between $5-$20 per item.\n- Pharmacies are readily available in San Marino, with many located in urban areas.\n- Prescription rules are similar to those in other European countries, with a doctor's prescription required for most medications.\n- Some medications may be more expensive in San Marino than in other countries, due to import costs and taxes.\n- It is recommended to have a prescription from a San Marino doctor to ensure that the medication is covered by insurance.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 118, or visit the emergency room at the nearest hospital.
