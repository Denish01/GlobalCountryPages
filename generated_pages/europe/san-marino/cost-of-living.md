San Marino is a small, independent republic located in the Apennine Mountains, surrounded by Italy. The country has a high standard of living and a strong economy, which contributes to its expensive cost of living. Compared to other European countries, San Marino is one of the pricier destinations, with prices similar to those found in major Italian cities like Rome or Florence.

Overall, San Marino is an expensive destination, but its stunning scenery, rich history, and unique culture make it a worthwhile visit for those who can afford it.
