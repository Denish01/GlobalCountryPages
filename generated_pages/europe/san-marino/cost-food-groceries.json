  "content": "Food prices in San Marino are generally higher than the regional average due to its unique location and limited land area, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant costing around $15-$20 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($15-$20 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($40-$60 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($500-$700 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($5-$7 USD)\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nSan Marino's food prices are influenced by its proximity to Italy and the country's high standard of living. The cost of living in San Marino is relatively high, and food prices are no exception. Eating out is a popular culture in San Marino, with many restaurants offering a range of Italian and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also common, and many locals prefer to buy fresh ingredients from local markets or supermarkets to prepare meals at home. The country's limited land area and lack of agricultural production mean that many food items are imported, which can drive up prices.\n\nThe high GDP per capita and low inflation rate in San Marino contribute to a stable and prosperous economy, which in turn affects food prices. The country's health expenditure per capita is also relatively high, which may influence the demand for high-quality and nutritious food. Overall, food prices in San Marino are higher than in some neighboring countries, but the quality and variety of food available are generally high. Consumers can expect to pay a premium for imported and high-end products, while local staples and traditional dishes may be more affordable.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50-$2.50 | 1.30-2.20 EUR | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.00-$3.00 | 1.80-2.60 EUR | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.50-$3.50 | 2.20-3.10 EUR | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.80-$2.80 | 1.60-2.50 EUR | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8.00-$12.00 | 7.00-10.50 EUR | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12.00-$18.00 | 10.50-15.80 EUR | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50-$3.50 | 2.20-3.10 EUR | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00-$3.00 | 1.80-2.60 EUR | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 1.30-2.20 EUR | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 0.90-1.80 EUR | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10.00-$15.00 | 8.80-13.20 EUR | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00-$2.00 | 0.90-1.80 EUR | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | (traditional dishes like piadina or supplì) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$30 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$120 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $7-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$4 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of food items can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in San Marino. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported and high-end items, but prices can be higher than at local markets. Local markets, on the other hand, often sell fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices. Consumers can expect to save around 10-20% by buying from local markets, especially for items like fruits, vegetables, and cheeses. However, the quality and variety of products may be lower at local markets, and bargaining is not typically expected.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, consumers can find good value in traditional products like **piadina** (a type of flatbread) and **formaggio** (local cheese). These items are often priced lower than at supermarkets and can be a great way to experience the local cuisine. On the other hand, imported and high-end products are often only available at supermarkets, and prices can be higher. Consumers should be aware of the prices and quality of products before making a purchase, and consider shopping at both supermarkets and local markets to get the best value.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries or **trattorias** can be a more affordable option, with meals starting from around $10-$15 USD.\n- Buying fresh produce and traditional products at local markets can be a good way to save money and experience the local cuisine.\n- **Piadina** and **formaggio** are local staples that are often priced lower than other food items.\n- Avoid buying imported and high-end products, which can be expensive and may not offer the best value.\n- Consider shopping at supermarkets for a wider range of products, but be aware of the prices and quality.\n- Drinking **acqua fresca** (fresh water) or **vino della casa** (house wine) can be a more affordable option than buying bottled water or expensive wine.",
