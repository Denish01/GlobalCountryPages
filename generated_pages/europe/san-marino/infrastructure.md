[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
San Marino's infrastructure is characterized by its high development level, with significant investments in recent years to maintain and upgrade its roads, energy, and telecommunications systems. The country's small size and mountainous terrain present unique challenges, but its strategic location near the Italian cities of Rimini and Bologna has driven growth and development. There is a notable urban-rural gap in infrastructure development, with the capital city of San Marino and surrounding areas enjoying better access to services and amenities than more remote rural areas.

The government of San Marino has implemented various initiatives to address the urban-rural gap and promote sustainable development, including investments in renewable energy, energy-efficient buildings, and environmentally friendly transportation systems. These efforts aim to balance economic growth with environmental protection and social equity, ensuring that the benefits of development are shared by all citizens.

San Marino's infrastructure development is also influenced by its relationship with neighboring Italy, with which it shares a common currency, language, and cultural heritage. The country's economy is closely integrated with Italy's, and many of its infrastructure projects are designed to facilitate trade, tourism, and cross-border cooperation.
