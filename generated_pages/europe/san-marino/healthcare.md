The quality of care is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. Urban areas, such as the capital city of San Marino, have better access to healthcare services and facilities compared to rural areas. However, the country's small size and proximity to Italy ensure that even rural areas are not far from quality medical care.

Private healthcare providers also exist, offering specialized services and more personalized care. Overall, the healthcare system in San Marino is well-regarded and provides excellent care to its citizens and visitors.

San Marino's healthcare system is also closely tied to the Italian healthcare system, with many San Marino residents receiving medical care in neighboring Italian cities.
