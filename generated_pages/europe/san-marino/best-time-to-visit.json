Peak season: June, July, and August. Budget season: November, December, January, and February. Avoid: January and February if you're not a fan of cold weather, and August if you're looking for smaller crowds. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nSan Marino has a **Mediterranean climate**, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The country's small size and location in the Apennine Mountains means that the climate can vary significantly depending on the elevation and location. The higher elevations tend to be cooler and wetter than the lower areas, while the coastal regions are generally warmer and drier. The **dry season** typically runs from May to September, with very little rainfall during these months. In contrast, the **wet season** runs from October to April, with the most significant rainfall occurring in November and December. The seasons can significantly affect travel in San Marino, with the peak summer season being the busiest and most expensive time to visit.\n\nThe spring and autumn seasons are ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking and sightseeing, as the weather is mild and pleasant. The summer months can be quite hot, especially in the lower elevations, while the winter months can be cool and wet. The country's many festivals and events are also an important consideration when planning a visit, as they can attract large crowds and drive up prices. Overall, the best time to visit San Marino depends on your individual preferences and interests, but the spring and autumn seasons are generally the most popular and enjoyable times to visit.\n\nSan Marino's unique location and climate also mean that the country is susceptible to **fog** and **mist**, especially in the higher elevations. This can make for some beautiful and atmospheric scenery, but it can also make it difficult to navigate the country's narrow roads and streets. Visitors should be prepared for changing weather conditions, especially during the winter months, and should plan accordingly.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Winter sports, low-season prices |\n| February | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Winter sports, low-season prices |\n| March | Mild and wet | Med | $$ | Spring festivals, outdoor activities |\n| April | Mild and pleasant | Med | $$ | Spring festivals, outdoor activities |\n| May | Warm and sunny | Med | $$$ | Outdoor activities, sightseeing |\n| June | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Summer festivals, outdoor activities |\n| July | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Summer festivals, outdoor activities |\n| August | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Summer festivals, outdoor activities |\n| September | Warm and sunny | Med | $$$ | Outdoor activities, sightseeing |\n| October | Mild and pleasant | Med | $$ | Autumn festivals, outdoor activities |\n| November | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Low-season prices, winter sports |\n| December | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Winter sports, low-season prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Epiphany | January | A traditional festival to celebrate the arrival of the Magi |\n| Carnival | February-March | A colorful and lively festival with parades and costumes |\n| Spring Festival | March-April | A celebration of the arrival of spring with music, food, and activities |\n| Republic Day | July | A national holiday to celebrate the founding of the Republic of San Marino |\n| Summer Festival | July-August | A series of outdoor concerts and events during the summer months |\n| Autumn Festival | September-October | A celebration of the harvest season with food, wine, and music |\n| Christmas Market | December | A festive market with traditional food, drinks, and crafts |\n| New Year's Eve | December | A celebration to mark the start of the new year with fireworks and music |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **coastal regions** tend to be warmer and drier than the higher elevations, making them ideal for summer visits.\n- The **mountainous regions** are cooler and wetter, making them better suited for spring and autumn visits.\n- The **capital city** of San Marino is a popular destination year-round, but it can be quite crowded during the peak summer season.\n- The **countryside** is generally quieter and more peaceful, making it an ideal destination for those looking to escape the crowds.\n- The **border regions** with Italy can be busier and more commercialized, with a greater range of amenities and services available.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during the peak summer season.\n- Consider visiting during the **shoulder season** (April-May or September-October) for smaller crowds and lower prices.\n- Pack layers for your visit, as the weather can be quite changeable, especially in the higher elevations.\n- Don't forget to try some of the local **cuisine**, which includes dishes such as pasta, pizza, and risotto.\n- Be aware of the **public holidays** and festivals, which can attract large crowds and drive up prices.\n- Consider purchasing a **San Marino Tourist Card**, which can provide discounts and benefits at many of the country's attractions and amenities.",
