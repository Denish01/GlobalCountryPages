[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The housing market in San Marino is characterized by a limited supply of available properties, which can drive up prices and make it challenging for renters to find affordable accommodations. Typical lease terms in San Marino range from 12 to 36 months, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters are entitled to a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the lease. Compared to its regional neighbors, San Marino's housing costs are relatively high, reflecting the country's strong economy and high standard of living. However, the country's small size and limited housing stock can make it difficult for renters to find affordable options, particularly in the city center.

The rental market in San Marino is also influenced by the country's **tourist season**, which can drive up prices and reduce the availability of accommodations during the summer months. Additionally, the country's **limited public transportation** options can make it difficult for renters to commute to work or other amenities, which can impact the desirability and affordability of certain neighborhoods. Overall, renters in San Marino need to be prepared for a competitive and relatively expensive housing market, and should be prepared to act quickly when they find a suitable property.
