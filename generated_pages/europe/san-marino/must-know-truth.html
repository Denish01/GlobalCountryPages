        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>San Marino is a <strong>sovereign</strong> microstate located in Europe, surrounded by Italy. The country's history dates back to 301 AD, when it was founded by <strong>Saint Marinus</strong>, a Christian stonemason. According to historical records, Saint Marinus fled to the Apennine Mountains to escape persecution by the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The state was initially a <strong>diocese</strong>, but it gradually developed into a <strong>republic</strong>. San Marino's independence was recognized by the Papal States in 1291, and it has maintained its sovereignty ever since.</p>
        <p>The country's strategic location made it an attractive target for various European powers, including the <strong>Holy Roman Empire</strong> and the <strong>Papal States</strong>. However, San Marino managed to maintain its independence through a combination of diplomacy and military defense. In 1600, the country adopted a <strong>constitution</strong>, which is considered one of the oldest in the world. The constitution established a <strong>parliamentary republic</strong> with a <strong>council</strong> of 60 members, known as the <strong>Grand and General Council</strong>.</p>

Today, San Marino is a member of various international organizations, including the <strong>United Nations</strong> and the <strong>Council of Europe</strong>.</p>
