The cost of living in San Marino is relatively high, but still lower than in Vatican City, which has a unique economic system and limited consumer options. Overall, San Marino offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. San Marino has a more diversified economy, with a strong manufacturing sector and a significant tourist industry, which contributes to its relatively lower prices. In contrast, Vatican City's economy is highly specialized and reliant on a limited number of industries, which can drive up prices for certain goods and services. Additionally, Vatican City's limited size and unique status as an independent city-state can make it more expensive for consumers to access certain products and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | San Marino (USD) | Vatican City (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 1,200 | 33% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 800 | 38% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 2,500 | 40% more expensive in Vatican City |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | San Marino (USD) | Vatican City (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 20 | 25% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 700 | 29% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 7 | 29% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Vatican City |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | San Marino (USD) | Vatican City (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.5 | 1.8 | 17% more expensive in Vatican City |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | San Marino (USD) | Vatican City (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 200 | 25% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive in Vatican City |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Vatican City |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | San Marino (USD) | Vatican City (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 2,000 | 25% savings in San Marino |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 3,500 | 29% savings in San Marino |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 5,500 | 27% savings in San Marino |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **San Marino is cheaper for:**\n  - Housing, with lower prices for apartments and houses\n  - Food, with lower prices for groceries and dining out\n  - Transportation, with lower prices for public transportation and taxis\n  - Utilities, with lower prices for internet and mobile plans\n- **Vatican City is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain luxury goods, which may be exempt from taxes\n  - Unique souvenirs and collector's items, which can only be found in Vatican City\n  - High-end dining experiences, with exclusive restaurants and wine lists\n  - Private tours and guided visits, which can provide a unique and personalized experience\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nSan Marino offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, transportation, and utilities.
