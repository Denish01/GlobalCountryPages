Svalbard's tax system is based on the principle of **territorial taxation**, where only income derived from sources within the territory is subject to taxation.

Residency rules for tax purposes in Svalbard are relatively straightforward, with individuals considered tax residents if they have a permanent home in the territory or have been present for more than 183 days in a calendar year.

The tax system in Svalbard is designed to be simple and non-intrusive, with no income tax, **value-added tax (VAT)**, or **capital gains tax** on personal income. This makes it an attractive location for individuals and businesses looking to minimize their tax liability. However, it is essential to note that while Svalbard has its own tax system, it is still part of the Norwegian tax system, and as such, some Norwegian tax laws and regulations apply.
