[SECTION] Overview: Svalbard vs Greenland [/SECTION]
Svalbard and Greenland are both located in the Arctic region, but they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Svalbard is a territory of Norway, and its economy is heavily influenced by its rich coal mining history and tourism industry. The territory has a high standard of living, with a strong focus on education, healthcare, and social welfare. In contrast, Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, and its economy is primarily driven by fishing and tourism. Greenland's economy is more vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market, which can impact the cost of living. Overall, Svalbard's stronger economy and higher standard of living contribute to its higher cost of living compared to Greenland.

The cost of living in Svalbard is significantly higher than in Greenland, particularly when it comes to housing, food, and transportation. Svalbard's remote location and limited access to goods and services drive up prices, making it one of the most expensive places to live in the world. In contrast, Greenland's cost of living is relatively lower, although it is still higher than in many other countries due to its remote location and limited economy. On average, Svalbard is around 20-30% more expensive than Greenland, although this can vary depending on the specific location and lifestyle.
