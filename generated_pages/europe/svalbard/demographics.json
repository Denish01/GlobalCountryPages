The population growth rate is slow, at around 0.5% per annum, due to the remote and harsh climate of the archipelago. The majority of the population, around 97%, resides in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Longyearbyen. The population density is extremely low, at 0.04 people per square kilometer, making Svalbard one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world. Migration patterns are limited, with most residents being Norwegian citizens or workers from other countries employed in the mining, tourism, or research sectors.\n\nThe urban population is concentrated in Longyearbyen, which offers modern amenities and services, including a hospital, schools, and shopping centers. The city's population has been steadily increasing, driven by the growth of the tourism and research industries. However, the remote location and harsh climate of Svalbard make it a challenging place to live, and the population remains relatively small.\n\nThe population of Svalbard is also characterized by a high level of education and a strong sense of community. Many residents are highly educated and have a strong interest in the natural environment and the unique cultural heritage of the archipelago. The community is close-knit, with many residents participating in local activities and events, such as the annual **Polarjazz** festival and the **Svalbard Marathon**.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Norwegian | 70% | Longyearbyen | Majority ethnic group |\n| Russian | 10% | Barentsburg | Minority ethnic group |\n| Thai | 5% | Longyearbyen | Immigrant community |\n| Polish | 3% | Longyearbyen | Immigrant community |\n| Other | 12% | Various | Includes other European and Asian nationalities |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity of Svalbard is relatively limited, with Norwegians making up the majority of the population, at around 70%.
