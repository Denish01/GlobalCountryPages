This makes it an attractive location for individuals and businesses looking to minimize their tax liability. However, it is essential to note that while Svalbard has its own tax system, it is still part of the Norwegian tax system, and as such, some Norwegian tax laws and regulations apply.\n\n[SECTION] Personal Income Tax [/SECTION]\nSince there is no income tax in Svalbard, there are no tax brackets or rates to consider.
