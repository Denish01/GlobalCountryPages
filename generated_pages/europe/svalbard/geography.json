The islands are also home to a number of unique and diverse ecosystems, including **tundra** and **Arctic desert** environments. The Svalbard archipelago is composed of three main islands: Spitsbergen, Nordaustlandet, and Edgeøya, as well as a number of smaller islands and islets.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nSvalbard's terrain is characterized by rugged mountains, glaciers, and fjords, with the majority of its land area covered by **ice caps** and **glaciers**.
