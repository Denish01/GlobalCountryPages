[SECTION] Overview: Svalbard vs Norway [/SECTION]
Svalbard and Norway have distinct economic contexts that impact their cost of living. Svalbard, a remote Norwegian territory in the Arctic Circle, has a limited economy driven by coal mining, tourism, and research. The territory's isolation and harsh climate contribute to higher costs for transportation, food, and utilities. In contrast, Norway has a more diverse economy with a strong focus on oil and gas, fishing, and forestry, which provides a broader range of job opportunities and a more stable economy. As a result, Norway tends to have lower costs for many everyday expenses.

The cost of living in Svalbard is generally higher than in Norway, with some exceptions. On average, Svalbard is around 20-30% more expensive than Norway, although this can vary depending on the specific category. For example, housing costs in Svalbard are significantly higher due to the limited supply of available apartments and houses. However, some categories like food and transportation may have similar prices in both locations. Overall, Norway is generally the more affordable option, but Svalbard's unique environment and experiences may make it worth the extra cost for some individuals.
