[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Svalbard's political system is based on the principles of Norwegian law, with some adaptations to account for the territory's unique situation. The Governor of Svalbard, appointed by the Norwegian government, serves as the head of the territory's administration. The Longyearbyen Community Council, composed of 15 members elected by the residents of Svalbard, has limited powers and primarily deals with local issues such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The **separation of powers** is not as clearly defined in Svalbard as it is in Norway, with the Governor holding significant executive authority. Svalbard is not a **federal** entity, but rather a **unitary** territory, with all major decisions made in Oslo.

The political system in Svalbard is designed to balance the needs of the local community with the interests of the Norwegian government. The territory's remote location and harsh climate mean that it requires a high degree of autonomy to function effectively, but at the same time, it is heavily dependent on Norway for financial and logistical support. This unique situation has led to the development of a **hybrid system**, which combines elements of direct rule with a degree of local self-government.

The **Svalbard Treaty**, signed in 1920, established Svalbard as a territory of Norway and defined the principles of its administration. The treaty recognizes the sovereignty of Norway over the territory, but also establishes certain rights and freedoms for the residents of Svalbard, including the right to engage in economic activities such as mining and fishing. The treaty has been amended several times since its signing, but its core principles remain in place.
