The territory is not divided into traditional states or provinces but is instead considered a single entity under the jurisdiction of the Norwegian government. The Governor of Svalbard serves as the highest authority, responsible for overseeing the territory's affairs, including law enforcement, environmental protection, and economic development. The lack of formal administrative divisions is due in part to Svalbard's small population and the fact that the territory is not self-governing, with most decisions being made by the Norwegian government.\n\nThe territory's administrative structure is relatively simple, with the Governor's office and the Longyearbyen Community Council being the main governing bodies. The Longyearbyen Community Council is responsible for providing local services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, to the residents of Longyearbyen. Despite the lack of formal divisions, Svalbard can be broadly divided into several regions, each with its own unique character and attractions. These regions are not formally defined but are generally recognized by locals and visitors alike.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Longyearbyen** (population estimate 2,100)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard and serves as the administrative center, with a range of amenities and services, including shops, restaurants, and museums.

There are no roads or trains, and the only way to travel between settlements is by air or sea. Domestic flights operate between Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, as well as to other smaller settlements. Boats and snowmobiles are also used for transportation, particularly in the winter months when the sea is frozen. Visitors can also take part in guided tours, such as dog sledding or snowmobiling, to explore the territory's unique landscape and wildlife. The lack of infrastructure and harsh climate make it essential for visitors to be well-prepared and flexible when traveling in Svalbard.",
