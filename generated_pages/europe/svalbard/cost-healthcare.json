  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Svalbard can vary greatly, with public healthcare services generally being more affordable than private services, but overall costs are relatively high due to the remote location of the territory.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $5,862\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 15% of total health expenditure\nHealthcare System: Public\nEmergency Number: 113\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: NOK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSvalbard's healthcare system is primarily public, with the Norwegian government providing most healthcare services to residents. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the system can be limited in terms of specialized care, and patients may need to be airlifted to mainland Norway for more complex treatments. For foreigners, the healthcare system can be more complicated, and it is highly recommended that they have private health insurance to cover any medical expenses.\n\nThe public healthcare system is generally free for residents, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, some services, such as dental care and physiotherapy, may require a small copayment. For foreigners, the cost of healthcare services can be high, and it is essential to have adequate health insurance to avoid significant out-of-pocket expenses. The Norwegian government also provides some financial assistance for low-income residents, but this does not typically apply to foreigners.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $30-$50 | $100-$200 | Public cost is for residents only |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $200-$500 | Public cost is for residents only |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $100-$300 | Public cost is for residents only, private cost includes X-ray |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Public cost is for residents only |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public cost is for residents only |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public hospital, cost is for residents only |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Public hospital, cost is for residents only |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Public hospital, cost is for residents only |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Public hospital, cost is for residents only |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Public hospital, cost is for residents only |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Public hospital, cost is for residents only |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $100-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, prescriptions for residents only |\n| Comprehensive Private | $500-$1,500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, prescriptions, dental care, and more for foreigners |\n| International / Expat | $1,000-$3,000 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication is generally subsidized by the public healthcare system for residents, with a small copayment of $5-$10 per prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medication is available at local pharmacies, with prices similar to those in mainland Norway.\n- Some medications may be in short supply due to the remote location of Svalbard, and patients may need to order medication from mainland Norway.\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not have a wide selection of specialty medications.\n- Prescription rules are similar to those in mainland Norway, with a valid prescription required for most medications.\n- Pharmacy services are available in Longyearbyen, the capital of Svalbard, but may be limited in other areas.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, patients should call the emergency number 113, which will connect them with the local hospital or emergency services. The hospital in Longyearbyen is well-equipped to handle most medical emergencies, but may not have the facilities or expertise to handle highly specialized cases. For foreigners, it is essential to have private health insurance that covers emergency medical evacuation to mainland Norway or another country with more advanced medical facilities. The best hospital for foreigners is the Longyearbyen Hospital, which has a 24-hour emergency department and can provide basic medical care.\n\nFor more complex medical cases, patients may need to be airlifted to mainland Norway, where they can receive more specialized care. The cost of emergency medical evacuation can be high, and it is essential to have adequate health insurance to cover these expenses. Patients should also be aware that medical facilities and services may be limited in Svalbard, and it is essential to take necessary precautions to stay healthy while traveling in the region. It is also recommended to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the location of hospitals, pharmacies, and other medical facilities, to ensure that you receive the best possible care in the event of a medical emergency.",
