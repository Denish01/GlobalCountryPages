[SECTION] Overview: Romania vs Serbia [/SECTION]
Romania and Serbia are two neighboring countries in Eastern Europe, both offering a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, Romania has a slight edge over Serbia, with prices that are generally 10-20% lower. This is due in part to Romania's larger economy and more developed infrastructure, which allows for greater competition and lower prices. However, Serbia has been rapidly developing in recent years, and its cost of living is still relatively low compared to other European countries.

The economic context of the two countries is also worth considering. Romania has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on services, industry, and agriculture. Serbia, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a greater reliance on industry and manufacturing. This difference in economic structure can affect the cost of living in various ways, such as the availability and price of certain goods and services. Overall, both countries offer a great value for expats, students, and retirees, but Romania may be the better choice for those on a tight budget.
