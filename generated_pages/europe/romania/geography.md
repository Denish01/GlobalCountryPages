[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Romania is a sovereign country located in southeastern Europe, bordered by several countries, including Ukraine to the north, Moldova to the east, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, and Bulgaria to the south. The country has a coastline along the Black Sea, which provides a significant outlet to the sea and facilitates trade and commerce. Romania's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange throughout history.

Romania's borders are defined by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries. The Carpathian Mountains form a natural border to the north and west, while the Danube River marks the border with Serbia and Bulgaria to the south. The country's eastern border with Moldova is largely defined by the Prut River. Overall, Romania's location and borders have played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Romania's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, hills, plains, and coastlines. The Carpathian Mountains, which cover about one-third of the country, are the dominant feature of Romania's landscape. The mountains are divided into three main ranges: the Eastern Carpathians, the Southern Carpathians, and the Western Carpathians. The highest peak, Moldoveanu Peak, is located in the Southern Carpathians and reaches an elevation of 2,544 meters.

The Romanian Plain, which covers about one-third of the country, is a low-lying area that stretches from the Carpathian Mountains to the Black Sea. The plain is drained by several major rivers, including the Danube, which forms the border with Serbia and Bulgaria. The Danube Delta, which is located in eastern Romania, is a unique and biodiverse region that is home to a wide range of flora and fauna. The delta is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the most important wetlands in Europe.

Romania's coastline along the Black Sea is about 249 kilometers long and features several major ports, including Constanta and Mangalia. The coastline is generally low-lying and sandy, with several beaches and resorts that are popular with tourists. The country's diverse landscape and natural beauty make it an attractive destination for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers.
