[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Romania's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with the government investing heavily in the construction of new roads, highways, and energy systems. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to modern amenities such as high-speed internet and reliable electricity. The country's infrastructure is also heavily influenced by its geographic location, with the Carpathian Mountains and the Danube River playing a major role in shaping the country's transportation networks. Despite these challenges, Romania has made significant progress in recent years, with the country's infrastructure ranking among the best in the region.

The government has also made efforts to improve the country's business environment, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth. This has led to the development of several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of new highways and the expansion of the country's airport network. However, corruption and bureaucratic inefficiencies remain major challenges, and the country's infrastructure development is often hindered by a lack of transparency and accountability.

Romania's infrastructure is also influenced by its membership in the European Union, which has provided significant funding for infrastructure development projects. The country has received billions of euros in EU funding for projects such as road construction, energy system modernization, and water and sanitation infrastructure development. This funding has played a major role in shaping the country's infrastructure development, and has helped to drive economic growth and improve living standards.
