[SECTION] How Romania Is Divided [/SECTION]
Romania is divided into 41 counties and the municipality of Bucharest, which serves as the capital. The country is further divided into eight development regions, which are used for statistical and administrative purposes. These development regions are not administrative divisions, but rather a way to group counties together based on geographic and economic criteria. The eight development regions are: Nord-Vest, Centru, Nord-Est, Sud-Est, Sud, Bucuresti-Ilfov, Sud-Vest Oltenia, and Vest.

The administrative divisions of Romania are the counties, which are responsible for providing local services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The municipality of Bucharest has a special status and is not part of any county. The counties are further divided into communes and cities, with the cities being the administrative centers of the counties.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Romania has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights connecting major cities, trains and buses providing affordable and convenient travel options, and a comprehensive road network that makes driving a viable option. The country's main airports are located in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and Timisoara, and offer connections to major European cities.
