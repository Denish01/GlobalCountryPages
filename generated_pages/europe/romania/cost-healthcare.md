[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Romania has a mixed healthcare system, combining elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer waiting times and less access to specialized care. Locals typically rely on the public system, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare due to the language barrier and perceived higher quality of care. The system works on a social health insurance model, where employees and employers contribute to a fund that covers basic medical services. However, many people choose to supplement this with private insurance to access better facilities and specialists.

For foreigners, it is recommended to have some form of health insurance, either through their employer or by purchasing private insurance. This is because public healthcare services may not always be available in English, and private healthcare providers often require upfront payment or proof of insurance. Additionally, some medical procedures and specialized care may only be available in private hospitals, which can be costly without insurance. It's worth noting that some private hospitals and clinics cater specifically to foreigners and offer high-quality care, but at a higher cost.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In case of a medical emergency, it's best to call the emergency number 112, which is available 24/7. Ambulances are widely available, but may not always be equipped with modern medical equipment. For foreigners, it's recommended to go to a private hospital or clinic, which may have more English-speaking staff and better facilities. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Romania include the MedLife Hospital in Bucharest and the Regina Maria Private Hospital in Cluj-Napoca. These hospitals offer high-quality care and have English-speaking staff, but may be more expensive than public hospitals.

It's worth noting that medical emergencies can be stressful and overwhelming, especially in a foreign country. It's a good idea to research local hospitals and clinics before an emergency arises, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. Additionally, having some basic knowledge of Romanian phrases, such as "ajutor" (help) and "spital" (hospital), can be helpful in an emergency situation.
