  "content": "Romania's healthcare system is a mixed model that combines elements of public and private healthcare, with a wide range of medical services available, although the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Adequate\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nRomania's healthcare system is primarily funded through a national health insurance program, which covers most of the population. The public healthcare system provides a wide range of services, including primary care, hospital care, and specialized treatments. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and better-staffed hospitals than rural areas. Private healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics, also play a significant role in the Romanian healthcare system, offering a range of services, including specialized treatments and luxury amenities. Despite the availability of medical services, Romania's healthcare system faces several challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care in rural areas.\n\nThe public healthcare system is generally considered to be more affordable than private healthcare, but the quality of care can be inconsistent. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer high-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. Many Romanians opt for private healthcare insurance to supplement their public coverage, which can provide access to better-equipped facilities and more specialized treatments. Foreigners living in Romania can also purchase private health insurance, which can provide coverage for a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, hospital stays, and specialized treatments.\n\nRomania has made significant progress in recent years to improve its healthcare system, including investing in new medical equipment and facilities, and increasing the number of medical professionals. However, the system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care in rural areas. To address these challenges, the Romanian government has implemented several reforms, including the introduction of a new healthcare law, which aims to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bucharest University Emergency Hospital | Bucharest | Public | Emergency care, trauma, surgery | Yes |\n| MedLife Hospital | Bucharest | Private | Cardiology, oncology, neurology | Yes |\n| Regina Maria Private Hospital | Bucharest | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Cluj-Napoca University Hospital | Cluj-Napoca | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Sibiu County Hospital | Sibiu | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Limited |\n| Euroclinic Hospital | Bucharest | Private | General medicine, surgery, dentistry | Yes |\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners living in Romania, as it can provide access to better-equipped facilities and more specialized treatments.\n- **Local health insurance options** are available, including the national health insurance program, which covers most of the population.\n- **Expats** can purchase private health insurance, which can provide coverage for a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, hospital stays, and specialized treatments.\n- **Costs** can vary significantly depending on the type of insurance and the level of coverage, but private health insurance can be expensive, with premiums ranging from several hundred to several thousand euros per year.\n- **Supplementary insurance** is also available, which can provide additional coverage for services not included in the national health insurance program, such as dental care and vision care.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, and it is recommended to work with a reputable insurance provider to ensure that claims are processed efficiently and effectively.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Romania, including prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but many medications are available without a prescription.\n- **Common brands** are available, including international brands and local generics.\n- **Costs** can vary significantly depending on the type of medication and the location, but many medications are relatively affordable.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies located throughout urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), as well as tetanus and diphtheria.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis A and B, as well as rabies.\n- **Endemic diseases** include tuberculosis and hepatitis, which are more common in rural areas.\n- **Water safety** is generally good, but it is recommended to drink bottled or filtered water to minimize the risk of waterborne illnesses.\n- **Food safety** is generally good, but it is recommended to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and raw vegetables.\n- **Insect-borne illnesses** are a risk, particularly in rural areas, and it is recommended to take precautions to minimize the risk of mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** include dental care, cosmetic surgery, and fertility treatments.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are available, including the Bucharest University Emergency Hospital and the MedLife Hospital.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many medical procedures costing significantly less in Romania than in Western Europe or North America.\n- **Language** is not generally a barrier, as many medical professionals speak English, particularly in private hospitals and clinics.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 112, which can be used to contact emergency services, including ambulance, fire, and police.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, but response times can be slow in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be located using online resources or by contacting the emergency services.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, and it is recommended to work with a reputable insurance provider to ensure that claims are processed efficiently and effectively.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, particularly if specialized care is not available in Romania.",
