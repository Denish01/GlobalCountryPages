[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Romanian property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including economic growth, urbanization, and foreign investment. The market is characterized by a mix of old and new properties, with many historic buildings being renovated and converted into modern apartments and offices. The demand for housing is high, particularly in urban areas, where many young professionals and families are looking for quality accommodation. The price trajectory has been upward, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per year in recent years. However, the market is still relatively affordable compared to other European countries, making it an attractive destination for foreign investors and buyers.

The urban property market is more developed, with a wider range of properties available, including modern apartments, offices, and commercial spaces. In contrast, the rural property market is less developed, with a focus on traditional houses and agricultural land. The government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the rural property market, including subsidies for rural development and infrastructure projects.

The Romanian property market is also influenced by the country's **EU membership**, which has brought many benefits, including increased investment, improved infrastructure, and a more stable economic environment. However, the market is not without its challenges, including a complex bureaucracy, corruption, and a lack of transparency in some areas.
