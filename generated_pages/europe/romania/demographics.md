[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Romania has a relatively stable population size, with a slow decline in recent years due to low fertility rates and migration. The population growth rate is estimated to be around -0.3%, which is one of the lowest in Europe. The country's median age is approximately 42.5 years, indicating an aging population.

Romania's life expectancy is around 75.6 years, which is slightly below the European average.

The population of Romania is also characterized by a low fertility rate, with an average of 1.5 children per woman. This has contributed to a decline in the population size, as well as an aging population. Migration patterns have also played a significant role in shaping the population of Romania, with many young people leaving the country to work abroad. However, the country has also seen an influx of migrants from other parts of Europe and beyond, which has contributed to its cultural and economic diversity.

In terms of population trends, Romania is expected to continue experiencing a decline in population size, with estimates suggesting that the population could decrease by around 10% by 2050. This decline is largely due to low fertility rates and migration, as well as an aging population. However, the country is also taking steps to address these trends, including implementing policies to support families and encourage migration.
