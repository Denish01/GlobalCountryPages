[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Romanian is the predominant language spoken in Romania, with over 90% of the population using it as their first language. The language has several regional dialects, including the Transylvanian, Oltenian, and Muntenian dialects, each with their own unique characteristics and pronunciation. In addition to Romanian, there are several minority languages spoken in the country, including Hungarian, German, and Romani, which are recognized and protected by the government. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry, but it is still not as widely spoken as in other European countries.

Despite the growing popularity of English, it is still not universally understood, and visitors may encounter some difficulties when communicating with locals, especially outside of major cities like Bucharest. However, many Romanians, particularly in the service industry, are making an effort to learn English and other foreign languages to cater to the growing number of tourists. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Romania is diverse and complex, with a mix of traditional and modern languages, dialects, and cultural influences.

Romania's language policy is designed to promote the use of Romanian as the official language, while also protecting the rights of minority language speakers. The government has implemented various measures to support language education and cultural preservation, including bilingual signage and language classes for minority language speakers. As a result, visitors to Romania can expect to hear a variety of languages spoken, from Romanian and Hungarian to German and English, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage and linguistic diversity.
