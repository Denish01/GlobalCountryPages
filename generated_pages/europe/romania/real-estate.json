The market is characterized by a mix of old and new properties, with many historic buildings being renovated and converted into modern apartments and offices. The demand for housing is high, particularly in urban areas, where many young professionals and families are looking for quality accommodation. The price trajectory has been upward, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per year in recent years.
