  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Romania varies significantly between public and private systems, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for around 23% of total health expenditure per capita, which stands at $1,051.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,051 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 23.0% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: RON\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nRomania has a mixed healthcare system, combining elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer waiting times and less access to specialized care. Locals typically rely on the public system, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare due to the language barrier and perceived higher quality of care. The system works on a social health insurance model, where employees and employers contribute to a fund that covers basic medical services. However, many people choose to supplement this with private insurance to access better facilities and specialists.\n\nFor foreigners, it is recommended to have some form of health insurance, either through their employer or by purchasing private insurance. This is because public healthcare services may not always be available in English, and private healthcare providers often require upfront payment or proof of insurance. Additionally, some medical procedures and specialized care may only be available in private hospitals, which can be costly without insurance. It's worth noting that some private hospitals and clinics cater specifically to foreigners and offer high-quality care, but at a higher cost.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have long waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private specialists often require upfront payment |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dentists may offer more advanced treatments |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Private optometrists may have more modern equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have limited English-speaking staff |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable facilities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | Private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospitals offer more amenities and English-speaking staff |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private clinics may offer more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public healthcare services, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private healthcare services, specialized care, hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, high-end medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a Romanian doctor\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, but may not always be labeled in English\n- Common medications like painkillers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$20\n- Pharmacies are widely available in cities, but may be less common in rural areas\n- Some pharmacies may offer delivery or online ordering services\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, and medications may not always be available without a prescription\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it's best to call the emergency number 112, which is available 24/7. Ambulances are widely available, but may not always be equipped with modern medical equipment. For foreigners, it's recommended to go to a private hospital or clinic, which may have more English-speaking staff and better facilities. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Romania include the MedLife Hospital in Bucharest and the Regina Maria Private Hospital in Cluj-Napoca. These hospitals offer high-quality care and have English-speaking staff, but may be more expensive than public hospitals.\n\nIt's worth noting that medical emergencies can be stressful and overwhelming, especially in a foreign country. It's a good idea to research local hospitals and clinics before an emergency arises, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. Additionally, having some basic knowledge of Romanian phrases, such as \"ajutor\" (help) and \"spital\" (hospital), can be helpful in an emergency situation.",
