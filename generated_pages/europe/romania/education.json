Primary education, also known as **gimnaziu**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 11 and is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in core subjects such as mathematics, language, and science. Secondary education, also known as **liceu**, is also compulsory and is designed to prepare students for higher education or the workforce. Tertiary education, also known as **universitate**, is provided by universities and colleges and offers students a wide range of academic programs to choose from.\n\nThe quality of education in Romania is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on theoretical knowledge and critical thinking. However, there are some challenges facing the education system, including a lack of resources and infrastructure in some areas, as well as a brain drain of talented young Romanians who choose to pursue their education and careers abroad. Public education is free and compulsory, while private education is also available for those who can afford it.\n\nThe Romanian education system is overseen by the Ministry of Education and Research, which is responsible for setting national standards and policies for education. The ministry also provides funding and support for schools and universities, as well as programs to promote education and lifelong learning.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
