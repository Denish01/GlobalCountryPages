[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Romania's economy is classified as an upper-middle income economy, with a high-income economy trajectory. The country has experienced significant economic growth since joining the European Union in 2007, driven by foreign investment, trade, and a growing services sector. Romania's economy is driven by a mix of industrial production, services, and agriculture, with a strong focus on exports. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with GDP growth averaging around 4% per year. However, the economy still faces challenges, including a high fiscal deficit, corruption, and a need for further structural reforms.

Romania's economic development level is characterized by a growing middle class, increasing urbanization, and a shift towards a more service-oriented economy. The country has a highly skilled and educated workforce, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Romania's economic trajectory is expected to continue on a positive path, driven by EU funding, foreign investment, and a growing domestic market.

Despite the progress made, Romania still faces significant challenges, including a high level of corruption, a need for further institutional reforms, and a lack of investment in certain sectors, such as infrastructure and education. The country must also navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing global economy, including the impact of Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
