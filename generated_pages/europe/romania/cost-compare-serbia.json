  "content": "Romania is generally cheaper than Serbia, with an overall cost of living that is around 10-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nRomania GDP per Capita (PPP): 29,444\nSerbia GDP per Capita (PPP): 23,851\nRomania Inflation Rate: 3.8%\nSerbia Inflation Rate: 4.1%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Romania\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Romania vs Serbia [/SECTION]\nRomania and Serbia are two neighboring countries in Eastern Europe, both offering a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, Romania has a slight edge over Serbia, with prices that are generally 10-20% lower. This is due in part to Romania's larger economy and more developed infrastructure, which allows for greater competition and lower prices. However, Serbia has been rapidly developing in recent years, and its cost of living is still relatively low compared to other European countries.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries is also worth considering. Romania has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on services, industry, and agriculture. Serbia, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a greater reliance on industry and manufacturing. This difference in economic structure can affect the cost of living in various ways, such as the availability and price of certain goods and services. Overall, both countries offer a great value for expats, students, and retirees, but Romania may be the better choice for those on a tight budget.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Romania (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 350 | 400 | 14% more expensive in Serbia |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 200 | 250 | 25% more expensive in Serbia |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 600 | 700 | 17% more expensive in Serbia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Romania (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 12 | 20% more expensive in Serbia |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 350 | 17% more expensive in Serbia |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 2.5 | 25% more expensive in Serbia |\n| Coffee | 1.5 | 2 | 33% more expensive in Serbia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Romania (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 25 | 25% more expensive in Serbia |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.6 | 20% more expensive in Serbia |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1.3 | 8% more expensive in Serbia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Romania (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 120 | 20% more expensive in Serbia |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 25 | 25% more expensive in Serbia |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 12 | 20% more expensive in Serbia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Romania (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1000 | 20% savings in Romania |\n| Mid-Range | 1200 | 1500 | 20% savings in Romania |\n| Comfortable | 2000 | 2500 | 20% savings in Romania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Romania is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are 10-20% lower than in Serbia\n- Food and dining, with meal prices that are 15-25% lower than in Serbia\n- Transportation, with taxi and transit pass prices that are 15-25% lower than in Serbia\n- Utilities and internet, with prices that are 10-20% lower than in Serbia\n- **Serbia is cheaper for:**\n- Certain types of groceries, such as meat and dairy products, which can be 10-20% cheaper than in Romania\n- Entertainment and leisure activities, such as cinema tickets and museum entry fees, which can be 10-20% cheaper than in Romania\n- Certain types of clothing and footwear, which can be 10-20% cheaper than in Romania\n- Travel and tourism, with prices for accommodation and activities that are 10-20% cheaper than in Romania\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIn conclusion, Romania offers a better value for expats, students, and retirees who are looking for a low-cost lifestyle in Eastern Europe.
