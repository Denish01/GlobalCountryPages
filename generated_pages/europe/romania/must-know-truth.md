The kingdom was later conquered by the **Roman Empire** in 101-102 AD and 105-106 AD, during the reign of Emperor Trajan. The Roman province of **Dacia** was established, and it existed until the 3rd century AD. After the Roman withdrawal, the region was invaded by various tribes, including the **Goths**, **Huns**, and **Avars**. In the 10th century, the **Hungarian Kingdom** expanded into the region, and it remained under Hungarian rule until the 16th century.

In the 14th century, the **Principality of Wallachia** and the **Principality of Moldavia** were established, and they existed as separate entities until the 19th century. The **Ottoman Empire** exerted significant influence over the region, and it controlled the principalities from the 16th century until the 19th century. In 1859, the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia were united under a single ruler, **Alexandru Ioan Cuza**, and the **United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia** were established. Romania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877, and it was recognized as a sovereign state in 1881.
