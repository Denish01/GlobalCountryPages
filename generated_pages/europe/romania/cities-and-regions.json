The country is further divided into eight development regions, which are used for statistical and administrative purposes. These development regions are not administrative divisions, but rather a way to group counties together based on geographic and economic criteria. The eight development regions are: Nord-Vest, Centru, Nord-Est, Sud-Est, Sud, Bucuresti-Ilfov, Sud-Vest Oltenia, and Vest.\n\nThe administrative divisions of Romania are the counties, which are responsible for providing local services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The municipality of Bucharest has a special status and is not part of any county. The counties are further divided into communes and cities, with the cities being the administrative centers of the counties.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Bucharest** (2.2M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, cultural landmarks, and vibrant nightlife\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and entertainment\n\n**Cluj-Napoca** (324,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, university town\nKnown For: its historic center, cultural events, and vibrant student life\nBest For: visitors interested in culture, education, and nightlife\n\n**Timisoara** (319,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, industrial center\nKnown For: its historic architecture, cultural events, and industrial heritage\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and industry\n\n**Iasi** (290,000)\nRole: cultural center, university town, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic center, cultural landmarks, and vibrant student life\nBest For: visitors interested in culture, education, and history\n\n**Constanta** (283,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub, tourist center\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, beautiful beaches, and vibrant nightlife\nBest For: visitors interested in history, beach activities, and entertainment\n\n**Craiova** (269,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, industrial center\nKnown For: its historic architecture, cultural events, and industrial heritage\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and industry\n\n**Galati** (244,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub, industrial center\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, industrial heritage, and vibrant nightlife\nBest For: visitors interested in history, industry, and entertainment\n\n**Brasov** (233,000)\nRole: tourist center, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic center, cultural landmarks, and nearby ski resorts\nBest For: visitors interested in culture, history, and outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Transylvania | mountainous, cultural | historic cities, medieval towns, natural beauty | Cluj-Napoca |\n| Moldova | historical, cultural | monasteries, fortresses, traditional villages | Iasi |\n| Wallachia | historical, agricultural | historic cities, wine regions, traditional villages | Bucharest |\n| Dobruja | coastal, tourist | beaches, historic landmarks, natural reserves | Constanta |\n| Oltenia | agricultural, industrial | traditional villages, industrial centers, natural beauty | Craiova |\n| Banat | cultural, industrial | historic cities, cultural events, industrial heritage | Timisoara |\n| Maramures | traditional, rural | wooden churches, traditional villages, natural beauty | Baia Mare |\n| Bucuresti-Ilfov | urban, economic | business centers, cultural events, historic landmarks | Bucharest |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Romania differ significantly in terms of culture, with Transylvania being known for its Hungarian and German influences, while Moldova is famous for its traditional Romanian culture.\n- The economy of Romania varies by region, with the western regions of Banat and Arad being more industrialized, while the eastern regions of Moldova and Dobruja are more agricultural.\n- The climate of Romania also differs by region, with the mountainous regions of Transylvania and Maramures being colder and snowier, while the coastal regions of Dobruja are milder and more humid.\n- The language spoken in Romania is predominantly Romanian, but there are also significant minority languages spoken in certain regions, such as Hungarian in Transylvania and German in Banat.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nRomania has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights connecting major cities, trains and buses providing affordable and convenient travel options, and a comprehensive road network that makes driving a viable option. The country's main airports are located in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and Timisoara, and offer connections to major European cities. The train network is operated by CFR, and offers a range of services, from high-speed trains to slower, more scenic routes. Bus companies such as Fany and Atlassib offer frequent services between cities, and are often a more affordable option than trains.\n\nDriving in Romania can be challenging, especially on rural roads, but the country's main highways are well-maintained and offer a convenient way to explore the country. Car rental companies such as Europcar and Hertz have offices in major cities, and offer a range of vehicles to suit different budgets and preferences.
