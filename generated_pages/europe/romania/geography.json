The Carpathian Mountains form a natural border to the north and west, while the Danube River marks the border with Serbia and Bulgaria to the south. The country's eastern border with Moldova is largely defined by the Prut River.

The plain is drained by several major rivers, including the Danube, which forms the border with Serbia and Bulgaria.
