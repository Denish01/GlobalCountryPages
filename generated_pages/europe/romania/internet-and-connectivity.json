The country has a well-developed telecommunications infrastructure, with a strong focus on mobile and fixed broadband services. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide in terms of internet quality, with urban areas tend to have faster and more reliable connections compared to rural areas. Despite this, the overall reliability of the internet in Romania is good, with few reports of significant outages or disruptions.\n\nIn terms of internet penetration, Romania has made significant progress in recent years, with over 70% of the population having access to the internet. This has been driven in part by government initiatives to improve broadband coverage and promote digital literacy. As a result, tourists and remote workers can expect to find good internet connectivity in most parts of the country, particularly in urban areas. However, it's still worth noting that internet speeds can vary depending on the location and provider, so it's a good idea to research and compare different options before choosing an internet service.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Romania is relatively straightforward, with several major carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers in Romania are Orange, Vodafone, and Telekom, all of which offer a range of prepaid and postpaid plans. To buy a SIM card, you'll typically need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some carriers may have additional requirements. It's a good idea to research and compare the different plans and prices before making a purchase, as they can vary significantly.\n\nOnce you've chosen a carrier, you can buy a SIM card at one of their retail stores, or at a newsagent or convenience store. Many carriers also offer online purchasing options, which can be convenient if you're short on time. In terms of cost, a tourist SIM card typically costs around 10 USD, although prices can vary depending on the carrier and plan.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Orange | Prepaid Starter | 1GB | 5 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n| Vodafone | Tourist Plan | 5GB | 15 USD | Valid for 30 days, includes EU roaming |\n| Telekom | Prepaid Internet | 10GB | 20 USD | Valid for 30 days, includes 4G coverage |\n| Digi | Tourist SIM | 20GB | 25 USD | Valid for 30 days, includes 4G coverage and EU roaming |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels and guesthouses offering free WiFi to their guests.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is widespread, with many cafes and coffee shops offering free WiFi to customers.\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in larger cities like Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca.\n- Public WiFi is available in many cities, although the quality and coverage can vary.\n- Many shopping malls and airports also offer free WiFi, making it easy to stay connected on the go.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Impact Hub and TechHub offer reliable and fast internet, as well as a range of amenities and networking opportunities.\n- Reliable cafe chains like Starbucks and Costa Coffee offer good WiFi and a comfortable working environment.\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and portable WiFi routers can be useful in case of an emergency or internet outage.\n- VPNs can be useful for remote workers who need to access sensitive or restricted content, or who want to protect their online security.\n- Many cities also have a range of libraries and community centers that offer free or low-cost internet access.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is generally not a concern in Romania, although some websites and services may be blocked due to copyright or other restrictions.\n- Some websites and services may be blocked due to EU data protection regulations, so it's a good idea to research and understand these restrictions before traveling.\n- VPNs can be useful for accessing blocked content, but be sure to choose a reputable and secure provider.\n- Roaming alternatives like eSIMs and portable WiFi routers can be a convenient and cost-effective way to stay connected while traveling.\n- Be sure to research and understand the terms and conditions of your internet plan, including any data limits or restrictions.\n- It's also a good idea to keep your devices and online accounts secure, using strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect against hacking and other online threats.",
