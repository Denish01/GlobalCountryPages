  "content": "Romania's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 73%\nRoad Network: 84,185 km, with a mix of modern highways and rural roads\nRail Network: 10,781 km\nMajor Airports: 17\nMajor Ports: 3, including the port of Constanta on the Black Sea\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nRomania's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with the government investing heavily in the construction of new roads, highways, and energy systems. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to modern amenities such as high-speed internet and reliable electricity. The country's infrastructure is also heavily influenced by its geographic location, with the Carpathian Mountains and the Danube River playing a major role in shaping the country's transportation networks. Despite these challenges, Romania has made significant progress in recent years, with the country's infrastructure ranking among the best in the region.\n\nThe government has also made efforts to improve the country's business environment, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth. This has led to the development of several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of new highways and the expansion of the country's airport network. However, corruption and bureaucratic inefficiencies remain major challenges, and the country's infrastructure development is often hindered by a lack of transparency and accountability.\n\nRomania's infrastructure is also influenced by its membership in the European Union, which has provided significant funding for infrastructure development projects. The country has received billions of euros in EU funding for projects such as road construction, energy system modernization, and water and sanitation infrastructure development. This funding has played a major role in shaping the country's infrastructure development, and has helped to drive economic growth and improve living standards.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 84,185 km | Good | Includes 747 km of highways and 17,205 km of national roads |\n| Railways | 10,781 km | Moderate | Includes 4,030 km of electrified railways and 3,166 km of double-track railways |\n| Airports | 17 international, 14 domestic | Good | Includes the major airports of Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and Timisoara |\n| Ports | 3 major | Good | Includes the port of Constanta, which is one of the largest ports on the Black Sea |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Romania's energy mix is dominated by **coal** and **natural gas**, which account for over 70% of the country's electricity generation.\n- The country has made significant progress in recent years in increasing its **renewable energy** capacity, with a focus on **wind power** and **solar energy**.\n- Romania's energy system is relatively reliable, with an average of 2-3 hours of power outages per year.\n- The country has also made efforts to improve its energy efficiency, with a focus on reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of **energy-efficient technologies**.\n- Romania is also a major **oil producer**, with significant reserves of crude oil and natural gas.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but may not be safe in rural areas due to a lack of proper treatment and infrastructure.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** is also relatively high, with over 95% of the population having access to improved water sources.\n- However, there are still significant challenges in rural areas, where many communities lack access to modern **water and sanitation infrastructure**.\n- The government has made efforts to improve the country's water and sanitation infrastructure, with a focus on increasing access to modern amenities and promoting **sustainable water management** practices.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively high, with over 95% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic internet** is also widely available, with over 70% of the population having access to high-speed internet services.\n- The country has also made significant progress in recent years in rolling out **4G and 5G networks**, with a focus on improving mobile internet speeds and increasing access to high-speed internet services.\n- **Postal services** are also relatively well-developed, with a focus on providing reliable and efficient mail delivery services.\n- However, there are still significant challenges in rural areas, where many communities lack access to modern **telecommunications infrastructure**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched several major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of a new **high-speed rail line** between Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca.\n- The country has also received significant funding from the EU for infrastructure development projects, including the construction of new **roads and highways**.\n- The government has also made efforts to promote **private sector investment** in infrastructure development, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth.\n- The country has also launched several initiatives to improve its **energy efficiency** and reduce its **carbon footprint**, with a focus on promoting the use of **renewable energy sources** and **energy-efficient technologies**.\n- The government has also made efforts to improve the country's **water and sanitation infrastructure**, with a focus on increasing access to modern amenities and promoting **sustainable water management** practices.",
