[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Romania has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, with significant regional variations. The country can be divided into several climate zones, including the **Carpathian Mountains** with a mountainous climate, the **Transylvanian Plateau** with a continental climate, and the **Black Sea coast** with a maritime climate. The dry season typically runs from April to September, while the wet season occurs from October to March. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the summer months being the best time to visit the beaches and the mountains, while the spring and autumn months are ideal for exploring the cities and the countryside.

The winter months can be quite cold, especially in the mountains, with significant snowfall and limited access to some areas. However, this is also the best time to enjoy winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding. The spring months bring mild temperatures and beautiful scenery, with the blooming of flowers and the greenery of the forests. The autumn months offer a riot of colors, with the changing leaves and the harvest season.

The seasons also affect the crowds and prices, with the peak season being the summer months when schools are on vacation and tourists flock to the beaches and the mountains. The shoulder season, which includes the spring and autumn months, offers a good balance between the weather and the crowds, with lower prices and a more relaxed atmosphere.
