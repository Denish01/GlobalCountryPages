[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Romania's healthcare system is primarily funded through a national health insurance program, which covers most of the population. The public healthcare system provides a wide range of services, including primary care, hospital care, and specialized treatments. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and better-staffed hospitals than rural areas. Private healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics, also play a significant role in the Romanian healthcare system, offering a range of services, including specialized treatments and luxury amenities. Despite the availability of medical services, Romania's healthcare system faces several challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care in rural areas.

The public healthcare system is generally considered to be more affordable than private healthcare, but the quality of care can be inconsistent. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer high-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. Many Romanians opt for private healthcare insurance to supplement their public coverage, which can provide access to better-equipped facilities and more specialized treatments. Foreigners living in Romania can also purchase private health insurance, which can provide coverage for a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, hospital stays, and specialized treatments.

Romania has made significant progress in recent years to improve its healthcare system, including investing in new medical equipment and facilities, and increasing the number of medical professionals. However, the system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care in rural areas. To address these challenges, the Romanian government has implemented several reforms, including the introduction of a new healthcare law, which aims to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.
