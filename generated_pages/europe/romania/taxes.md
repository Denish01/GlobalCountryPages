[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]

The Romanian tax system is governed by the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF), which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs, and other fiscal obligations. The tax year in Romania runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by May 25th of each year. Taxpayers can file their returns online or through a tax representative, and they must pay any outstanding taxes by the same deadline to avoid penalties and interest.
