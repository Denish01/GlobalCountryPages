The quality of education in public schools is generally good, with a strong emphasis on subjects like mathematics, science, and languages. However, private schools often offer better facilities and more extracurricular activities, making them a popular choice for families who can afford them. The language of instruction is Hungarian, but many schools also offer English and other foreign languages as part of their curriculum. Compulsory education in Hungary lasts for 12 years, from the age of 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and vocational education.\n\nInternational schools are also available in Hungary, particularly in the capital city of Budapest, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB), British, and American systems. These schools cater to the children of expats and international families, as well as Hungarian students who want to pursue higher education abroad. The availability of international schools in Hungary has increased in recent years, making it easier for families to find a school that meets their needs and provides a high-quality education.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, with a strong emphasis on core subjects |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Range of schools with varying levels of quality and extracurricular activities |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Comprehensive education, with a range of subject options |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Better facilities and more extracurricular activities than public schools |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | IB, British, and American curricula available, with a focus on international education |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $0-$1,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Low tuition fees for local students, with a range of programs available |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Higher tuition fees, with a focus on business, economics, and social sciences |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$3,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Eötvös Loránd University, with a strong reputation for academic excellence |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Varies depending on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | One-on-one tutoring available for a range of subjects |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Hungarian language courses available for beginners and advanced learners |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, such as textbooks and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for some private and international schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Hungary are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and a high-quality education.\n- Scholarships are available for local and international students, with a range of programs and funding options available.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Hungary, with many universities and schools offering distance learning programs.\n- The quality of education in Hungary is generally high, with a strong emphasis on core subjects like mathematics and science.\n- Hungary is a member of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), which means that degrees from Hungarian universities are recognized across Europe.\n- [CALLOUT] It's worth noting that while public education is free or subsidized for local students, international students may need to pay tuition fees, even at public universities.",
