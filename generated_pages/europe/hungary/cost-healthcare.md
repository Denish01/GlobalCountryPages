[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Hungary has a mixed healthcare system, which combines elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, but it can be slow and bureaucratic. Private healthcare, on the other hand, is often faster and more efficient, but it can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the preferred option, as it is often free or low-cost. For foreigners, private healthcare may be a better option, as it can provide faster and more personalized care. However, it is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high.

The healthcare system in Hungary is overseen by the National Health Insurance Fund (NEAK), which provides coverage for most medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries. However, some services, such as dental care and prescription medications, may not be fully covered. In addition, some medical providers may not accept NEAK insurance, so it is essential to check beforehand. For foreigners, it is often recommended to purchase private health insurance, which can provide more comprehensive coverage and faster access to medical care.
