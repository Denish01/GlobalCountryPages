  "content": "Hungary's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications, although there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 85%\nRoad Network: 204,000 km, well-maintained\nRail Network: 7,794 km\nMajor Airports: 5\nMajor Ports: 1 major port on the Danube River\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nHungary has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving transportation links, increasing energy efficiency, and expanding access to telecommunications. The country's infrastructure is generally well-developed, with a strong road network, a comprehensive rail system, and a number of major airports. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to high-speed internet and other modern amenities. The government has launched a number of initiatives aimed at bridging this gap, including investments in rural broadband and transportation infrastructure.\n\nHungary's infrastructure development has been driven in part by its membership in the European Union, which has provided access to funding and expertise. The country has also sought to position itself as a hub for trade and investment in Central Europe, with a number of major companies establishing operations in the country. Despite these efforts, Hungary still faces a number of infrastructure challenges, including a need for ongoing investment in transportation and energy infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Hungary's infrastructure is well-developed, but there is still a need for ongoing investment and improvement. The government has recognized this need and has launched a number of initiatives aimed at addressing the country's infrastructure challenges. With its strong economy and strategic location, Hungary is well-positioned to continue to develop its infrastructure and attract investment and trade.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 204,000 km | Good | Well-maintained, with a number of highways and expressways |\n| Railways | 7,794 km | Moderate | Comprehensive network, but some lines are in need of upgrade |\n| Airports | 5 international, 2 domestic | Good | Major airports in Budapest, Debrecen, and other cities |\n| Ports | 1 major port on the Danube River | Moderate | Port of Budapest is an important hub for trade and commerce |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Power generation** is largely based on fossil fuels, with a significant portion coming from nuclear power\n- The **reliability of the grid** is generally good, with few outages or disruptions\n- **Renewable energy** is becoming increasingly important, with a focus on solar and wind power\n- **Energy efficiency** is a key priority, with a number of initiatives aimed at reducing energy consumption\n- **Natural gas** is an important source of energy, with a number of pipelines connecting Hungary to other European countries\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink, with a number of treatment plants and distribution systems in place\n- **Sanitation coverage** is nearly universal, with almost all households having access to modern sanitation facilities\n- **Water access** in rural areas can be a challenge, with some communities lacking access to clean water\n- **Wastewater treatment** is an important priority, with a number of plants and facilities in place to treat wastewater\n- **Water conservation** is becoming increasingly important, with a number of initiatives aimed at reducing water consumption\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is nearly universal, with a number of providers offering a range of services\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is becoming increasingly available, with a number of providers offering high-speed internet services\n- **4G and 5G rollout** is ongoing, with a number of providers investing in new network infrastructure\n- **Postal services** are provided by the Hungarian Post, with a number of branches and offices throughout the country\n- **Internet penetration** is high, with a significant portion of the population having access to the internet\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- **The Budapest-Belgrade railway** is a major development project, with a number of upgrades and improvements planned\n- **The M6 motorway** is a new highway that will connect Budapest to the southern city of Pécs\n- **The Paks nuclear power plant** is a major energy project, with a number of new reactors planned\n- **The Danube River port** is being upgraded, with a number of new facilities and infrastructure planned\n- **The Hungarian government's \"Digital Hungary\" initiative** is a major development project, with a number of investments planned in telecommunications and IT infrastructure",
