[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Hungary has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, characterized by cold winters and warm summers. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the Great Hungarian Plain, which is generally drier and sunnier, and the mountainous regions, which are cooler and more prone to rainfall. The dry season typically runs from April to October, with the wettest months being November and March. During the peak season, which coincides with the summer months, tourists flock to popular destinations like Budapest and Lake Balaton, making it the busiest time of the year.

The spring season, which lasts from March to May, is a great time to visit Hungary, as the weather is mild and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak season. The autumn season, which runs from September to November, is also a good time to visit, with comfortable temperatures and a range of festivals and events. The winter months, from December to February, are the coldest and darkest time of the year, but they also offer a unique opportunity to experience Hungary's festive atmosphere and enjoy winter sports.

The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Hungary, with the peak season offering a wide range of outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking, and water sports, while the off-season is better suited for indoor activities, like visiting museums and thermal baths. The spring and autumn seasons are ideal for sightseeing, as the mild weather makes it perfect for walking and exploring the country's many historical sites and cultural attractions.
