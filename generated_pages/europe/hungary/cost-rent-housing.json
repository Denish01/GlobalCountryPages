Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a security deposit of 2-3 months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have a written contract outlining the terms of the lease. Compared to its regional neighbors, Hungary's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Austria or Slovenia, but higher than in Ukraine or Serbia.\n\nThe Hungarian housing market has experienced some fluctuations in recent years, with a slight increase in prices due to the country's growing economy and tourism industry. However, the market remains relatively affordable, especially outside of the capital city Budapest. The government has implemented various initiatives to support affordable housing, including subsidies for first-time homebuyers and rent control measures. Despite these efforts, there is still a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly in the capital city.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $250-$450 | typical quality, 40-60 sqm |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $350-$600 | family size, 60-90 sqm |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,400 | $500-$900 | spacious, 90-120 sqm |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, historic buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, modern apartments |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | rural areas, older houses or farmhouses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Pest**: a popular neighborhood in Budapest with a wide range of accommodation options, typical rent range $400-$700 per month\n- **Buda**: a historic neighborhood in Budapest with a mix of old and new buildings, typical rent range $500-$1,000 per month\n- **Erzsébetváros**: a vibrant neighborhood in Budapest with a mix of cafes, restaurants, and shops, typical rent range $450-$800 per month\n- **Újpest**: a residential neighborhood in Budapest with a range of modern apartments, typical rent range $300-$600 per month\n- **Debrecen**: a city in eastern Hungary with a range of affordable accommodation options, typical rent range $200-$400 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Hungary [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best area for your needs and budget\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a reliable landlord and avoid scams\n- Negotiate the price and terms of the lease before signing a contract\n- Check if utilities such as electricity, water, and internet are included in the rent\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment to avoid the hassle of buying furniture\n- Be prepared to pay a security deposit and first month's rent upfront\n- Learn some basic Hungarian phrases to help you navigate the rental process and communicate with your landlord",
