[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Hungary's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the majority of students attending public schools. The quality of education in public schools is generally good, with a strong emphasis on subjects like mathematics, science, and languages. However, private schools often offer better facilities and more extracurricular activities, making them a popular choice for families who can afford them. The language of instruction is Hungarian, but many schools also offer English and other foreign languages as part of their curriculum. Compulsory education in Hungary lasts for 12 years, from the age of 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and vocational education.

International schools are also available in Hungary, particularly in the capital city of Budapest, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB), British, and American systems. These schools cater to the children of expats and international families, as well as Hungarian students who want to pursue higher education abroad. The availability of international schools in Hungary has increased in recent years, making it easier for families to find a school that meets their needs and provides a high-quality education.
