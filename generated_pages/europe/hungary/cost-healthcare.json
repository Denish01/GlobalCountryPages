  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Hungary can vary significantly depending on the type of care and insurance coverage, with a health expenditure per capita of $1,420 and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 23.1% of total healthcare spend.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,420 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 23.1% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: HUF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nHungary has a mixed healthcare system, which combines elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, but it can be slow and bureaucratic. Private healthcare, on the other hand, is often faster and more efficient, but it can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the preferred option, as it is often free or low-cost. For foreigners, private healthcare may be a better option, as it can provide faster and more personalized care. However, it is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high.\n\nThe healthcare system in Hungary is overseen by the National Health Insurance Fund (NEAK), which provides coverage for most medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries. However, some services, such as dental care and prescription medications, may not be fully covered. In addition, some medical providers may not accept NEAK insurance, so it is essential to check beforehand. For foreigners, it is often recommended to purchase private health insurance, which can provide more comprehensive coverage and faster access to medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public clinics often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private clinics may have shorter wait times |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public dental care may be limited |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private clinics may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have longer wait times for results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals may have more amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times for surgery |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospitals may have more personalized care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public clinics may have longer wait times for appointments |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | Private clinics may have more advanced equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Comprehensive coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be purchased at pharmacies with a doctor's prescription, and costs vary depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, and costs are generally lower than prescription medications\n- Common medications, such as pain relievers and antibiotics, can cost between $5-$20\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good, with many pharmacies located throughout the country\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, and medications may require a doctor's prescription to be purchased\n- Some medications may be cheaper at public pharmacies, while others may be more expensive\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 112, which is available 24/7. Ambulance services are generally well-equipped and can provide rapid transportation to a hospital. For foreigners, it is recommended to go to a private hospital, which can provide faster and more personalized care. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Hungary include the **Semmelweis University Hospital** and the **St. Istvan Hospital**, both of which are located in Budapest. These hospitals have a high standard of care and can provide a range of medical services, including emergency care, surgeries, and diagnostic tests.\n\nIt is also a good idea to research local emergency services and hospitals before arriving in Hungary, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. This can include having a list of emergency contact numbers, knowing the location of the nearest hospital, and having a basic understanding of the local healthcare system. By being prepared and having access to good medical care, foreigners can help ensure a safe and healthy stay in Hungary.",
