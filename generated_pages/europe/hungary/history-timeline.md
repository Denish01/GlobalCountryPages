# Hungary History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Hungary is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans over a thousand years, from the arrival of the Magyars in the 9th century to the modern era, with key events including the foundation of the Hungarian state, the Ottoman and Habsburg rule, the struggle for independence, and the country's development into a sovereign nation.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Hungary began with the arrival of the **Magyars**, a nomadic people from Central Asia, in the late 9th century. They established the **Principality of Hungary**, which eventually became the **Kingdom of Hungary** in 1000, with **Saint Stephen** as its first king. The kingdom flourished during the Middle Ages, with a strong economy, culture, and military. However, the **Ottoman Empire** conquered much of Hungary in the 16th century, and the country was divided into three parts: the Ottoman-occupied central region, the **Habsburg**-ruled west, and the **Principality of Transylvania** in the east. The struggle for independence and unity continued for centuries, with key figures such as **Francis II Rákóczi** and **Lajos Kossuth** playing important roles. In the 20th century, Hungary experienced significant political changes, including the establishment of a communist government after World War II, and the transition to a democratic system in the late 1980s.

The 20th century also saw significant economic development in Hungary, with the country becoming a member of the **European Union** in 2004. Today, Hungary is a **sovereign state** with a population of over 9.5 million people, a diverse culture, and a strong economy. The country has a rich cultural heritage, with numerous historical sites, museums, and festivals, and is known for its stunning natural beauty, including the **Danube River** and the **Carpathian Mountains**. Hungary's history has been shaped by its strategic location in Central Europe, with the country being a crossroads of different cultures, empires, and trade routes.

The country's history has also been marked by significant conflicts, including the **Austro-Hungarian War** and **World War I**, which led to the dissolution of the **Austro-Hungarian Empire** and the establishment of modern Hungary. The **Treaty of Trianon**, signed in 1920, defined the country's borders and led to significant territorial losses. During **World War II**, Hungary was an ally of the **Nazi Germany**, and the country suffered significant losses and damage. The post-war period saw the establishment of a communist government, which was followed by a transition to a democratic system in the late 1980s.

The modern era has seen significant economic development in Hungary, with the country becoming a major player in the European economy. The country has also made significant progress in terms of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. However, the country still faces challenges, including a declining population, corruption, and a complex relationship with the European Union. Overall, the history of Hungary is a complex and fascinating narrative that continues to shape the country's identity, culture, and politics today.

[SECTION] Founding & Formation [/SECTION]
The founding of Hungary is attributed to the Magyars, a nomadic people from Central Asia, who arrived in the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century. The Magyars established the Principality of Hungary, which eventually became the Kingdom of Hungary in 1000, with Saint Stephen as its first king. The kingdom flourished during the Middle Ages, with a strong economy, culture, and military. The **Golden Bull of 1222**, issued by King Andrew II, established the rights and privileges of the nobility, and is considered one of the most important documents in Hungarian history.

The formation of modern Hungary is a complex process that spanned several centuries. The country's borders were defined by the Treaty of Trianon, signed in 1920, which led to significant territorial losses. The country's independence was established in 1918, with the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The **Hungarian Soviet Republic**, established in 1919, was short-lived, and the country eventually became a kingdom again, with **Admiral Miklós Horthy** as its regent. The post-war period saw the establishment of a communist government, which was followed by a transition to a democratic system in the late 1980s.

[SECTION] Colonial & Independence Period [/SECTION]
Hungary did not have a colonial period in the classical sense, as it was itself colonized by the Ottoman Empire and later ruled by the Habsburgs. However, the country did have a significant independence movement, with key figures such as Francis II Rákóczi and Lajos Kossuth playing important roles. The **War of Independence**, fought from 1848 to 1849, was a significant event in Hungarian history, with the aim of establishing an independent Hungarian state. The **Austro-Hungarian Compromise**, established in 1867, created the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary, with Hungary having significant autonomy.

The independence movement continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with the country eventually gaining independence in 1918. The **Hungarian Declaration of Independence**, issued in 1849, is considered one of the most important documents in Hungarian history. The country's first leaders, including **Lajos Kossuth** and **Mihály Károlyi**, played important roles in shaping the country's future. The **Treaty of Trianon**, signed in 1920, defined the country's borders and led to significant territorial losses.

[SECTION] Modern Era [/SECTION]
The modern era of Hungary began with the transition to a democratic system in the late 1980s. The country joined the **European Union** in 2004, marking its integration into the European economic and political community. The **Orbán government**, which came to power in 2010, has implemented significant changes, including the **New Fundamental Law of Hungary**, which has been criticized by some as undermining the country's democratic institutions. The country has also made significant progress in terms of economic development, with a growing economy and a strong manufacturing sector.

The country has also made significant progress in terms of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. However, the country still faces challenges, including a declining population, corruption, and a complex relationship with the European Union. The **migration crisis**, which began in 2015, has had a significant impact on Hungary, with the country taking a hardline stance on immigration. The country's relations with the European Union have been strained, with the EU criticizing Hungary's handling of the migration crisis and the country's erosion of democratic norms.
