Peak season: June, July, and August. Budget season: November, December, January, and February. Avoid: November and March if you prefer dry weather, as these months tend to be the wettest. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nHungary has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, characterized by cold winters and warm summers. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the Great Hungarian Plain, which is generally drier and sunnier, and the mountainous regions, which are cooler and more prone to rainfall. The dry season typically runs from April to October, with the wettest months being November and March. During the peak season, which coincides with the summer months, tourists flock to popular destinations like Budapest and Lake Balaton, making it the busiest time of the year.\n\nThe spring season, which lasts from March to May, is a great time to visit Hungary, as the weather is mild and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak season. The autumn season, which runs from September to November, is also a good time to visit, with comfortable temperatures and a range of festivals and events. The winter months, from December to February, are the coldest and darkest time of the year, but they also offer a unique opportunity to experience Hungary's festive atmosphere and enjoy winter sports.\n\nThe seasons have a significant impact on travel in Hungary, with the peak season offering a wide range of outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking, and water sports, while the off-season is better suited for indoor activities, like visiting museums and thermal baths. The spring and autumn seasons are ideal for sightseeing, as the mild weather makes it perfect for walking and exploring the country's many historical sites and cultural attractions.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cold, snowy | Low | $ | Winter sports, thermal baths |\n| February | Cold, snowy | Low | $ | Winter festivals, ice skating |\n| March | Cool, rainy | Med | $$ | Spring festivals, hiking |\n| April | Mild, sunny | Med | $$ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| May | Warm, sunny | Med | $$ | Festivals, hiking, biking |\n| June | Warm, sunny | High | $$$ | Outdoor activities, peak season |\n| July | Hot, sunny | High | $$$ | Beach activities, water sports |\n| August | Hot, sunny | High | $$$ | Peak season, outdoor activities |\n| September | Mild, sunny | Med | $$ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| October | Cool, rainy | Med | $$ | Autumn festivals, hiking |\n| November | Cool, rainy | Low | $ | Thermal baths, indoor activities |\n| December | Cold, snowy | Low | $ | Winter festivals, Christmas markets |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Budapest Spring Festival | March-May | A series of cultural events, including concerts, dance performances, and exhibitions |\n| Sziget Festival | August | A popular music festival featuring international and local artists |\n| Busójárás | February-March | A traditional folk festival, recognized by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity |\n| Hungarian Grand Prix | July | A Formula One racing event, held at the Hungaroring circuit |\n| St. Stephen's Day | August | A national holiday, celebrating the country's founding and its first king, St. Stephen |\n| Christmas Markets | December | A festive market, offering traditional food, drinks, and handicrafts |\n| Wine Festival | September | A festival, showcasing Hungary's wine production, with wine tastings and live music |\n| Budapest Marathon | October | A major running event, attracting athletes from around the world |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Great Hungarian Plain** is generally drier and sunnier than the mountainous regions, making it a great destination for outdoor activities during the summer months.\n- The **Budapest** region has a more moderate climate, with colder winters and warmer summers, making it a popular destination year-round.\n- The **Lake Balaton** region is a popular summer destination, with a range of water sports and outdoor activities, but it can get crowded during the peak season.\n- The **Northern Mountains** are a great destination for hiking and skiing, with a range of trails and slopes for all levels.\n- The **Southern Great Plain** is a great destination for birdwatching and nature reserves, with a range of unique flora and fauna.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, which offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices.\n- Pack accordingly, with warm clothing for the winter months and light clothing for the summer months.\n- Don't forget to try some of Hungary's delicious cuisine, including **goulash**, **paprikás csirke**, and **halászlé**.\n- Be aware of the country's **public holidays**, which can affect the opening hours of attractions and the availability of public transportation.\n- Take advantage of the country's **thermal baths** and **spas**, which offer a unique and relaxing experience, especially during the winter months.",
