[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Hungary operates on the principle of **separation of powers**, dividing authority among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The **National Assembly**, the country's unicameral legislature, is composed of 199 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **President** serves as the head of state, with ceremonial and some constitutional powers, while the **Prime Minister** is the head of government, responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration. Hungary's political system is designed to ensure checks and balances among these branches, preventing any one branch from dominating the others.

The **unitary** nature of Hungary's government means that the central government holds significant power, with lesser autonomy granted to local governments. This structure allows for more centralized decision-making and policy implementation. However, the system also incorporates elements of **decentralization**, with local municipalities and counties having some degree of autonomy in managing local affairs.

Hungary's **constitutional framework** is based on the Constitution of Hungary, which was adopted in 2011. The Constitution outlines the principles of democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights, serving as the foundation for the country's legal and political system.
