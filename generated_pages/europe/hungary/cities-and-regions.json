These counties are further divided into smaller administrative units, such as towns and villages. The country also has 23 towns with county rights, which have a higher level of autonomy than regular towns. The capital city, Budapest, has a special status as a separate administrative unit. This division is based on historical and geographical factors, with each county having its own unique character and cultural heritage.\n\nThe administrative structure of Hungary is designed to provide a balance between central government control and local autonomy. The counties and towns with county rights have a significant degree of independence in managing their own affairs, while the central government is responsible for national policies and decisions. This system has been in place since the country's transition to democracy in the late 1980s and has undergone several reforms to improve efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Budapest** (1.7M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning architecture, thermal baths, and rich history.
