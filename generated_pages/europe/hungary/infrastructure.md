[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Hungary has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving transportation links, increasing energy efficiency, and expanding access to telecommunications. The country's infrastructure is generally well-developed, with a strong road network, a comprehensive rail system, and a number of major airports. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to high-speed internet and other modern amenities. The government has launched a number of initiatives aimed at bridging this gap, including investments in rural broadband and transportation infrastructure.

Hungary's infrastructure development has been driven in part by its membership in the European Union, which has provided access to funding and expertise. The country has also sought to position itself as a hub for trade and investment in Central Europe, with a number of major companies establishing operations in the country. Despite these efforts, Hungary still faces a number of infrastructure challenges, including a need for ongoing investment in transportation and energy infrastructure.

Overall, Hungary's infrastructure is well-developed, but there is still a need for ongoing investment and improvement. The government has recognized this need and has launched a number of initiatives aimed at addressing the country's infrastructure challenges. With its strong economy and strategic location, Hungary is well-positioned to continue to develop its infrastructure and attract investment and trade.
