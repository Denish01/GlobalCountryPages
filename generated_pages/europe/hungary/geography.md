[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Hungary is a **landlocked country** located in Central Europe, bordered by seven countries: Austria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia. It sits in the Carpathian Basin, a large **sedimentary basin** that covers much of Central and Eastern Europe. The country's unique location has made it a crossroads of trade and culture for centuries, with many different empires and civilizations vying for control over the region.

Hungary's borders are entirely composed of land borders, with no direct access to the sea. The country is bordered by the **Carpathian Mountains** to the east, the **Alps** to the west, and the **Pannonian Plain** to the south. The **Danube River**, one of Europe's most important waterways, flows through the country and provides a vital transportation route. Hungary's location has made it an important hub for trade and commerce, with many major cities and transportation routes passing through the country.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Hungary's terrain is characterized by a mix of **mountains**, **hills**, and **plains**. The country can be divided into three main regions: the **Great Hungarian Plain**, the **Transdanubian Hills**, and the **Carpathian Mountains**. The Great Hungarian Plain, which covers much of the country, is a flat and fertile region that is home to many of Hungary's major cities and agricultural areas. The Transdanubian Hills, which stretch across western Hungary, are a series of rolling hills and mountains that are home to many of the country's most beautiful landscapes.

The Carpathian Mountains, which cover eastern Hungary, are a rugged and mountainous region that is home to many of the country's highest peaks. The **Kékes**, which is Hungary's highest point, is located in the Carpathian Mountains and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside. Hungary is also home to many **rivers**, including the Danube, the Tisza, and the Szamos, which provide important transportation routes and support a wide range of aquatic life.

Hungary's landscape is also characterized by many **lakes** and **wetlands**, which provide important habitats for a wide range of plants and animals. The **Lake Balaton**, which is Central Europe's largest lake, is a popular tourist destination and is known for its beautiful beaches and water sports.
