[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Hungary's healthcare system is based on a universal health insurance model, where every citizen is entitled to healthcare services, including medical treatment, hospital care, and pharmaceuticals. The system is funded through a combination of government subsidies, social insurance contributions, and out-of-pocket payments. The public healthcare system is the primary provider of healthcare services, but there are also private healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics, that offer specialized services. The quality of care in Hungary is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical equipment. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped hospitals and a wider range of medical specialties available.

The public healthcare system in Hungary is free for citizens, but there may be some out-of-pocket costs for certain services, such as prescription medications and dental care. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, typically require payment upfront, although some may offer package deals or discounts for certain services. Overall, Hungary's healthcare system is well-organized and provides comprehensive coverage to its citizens, but there can be some challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to specialized care may be limited.

Hungary's healthcare system is also subject to the European Union's (EU) healthcare directives, which provide a framework for the provision of healthcare services across the EU. This means that EU citizens can access healthcare services in Hungary, and Hungarian citizens can access healthcare services in other EU countries, under certain conditions. This has helped to improve the quality of care and increase access to specialized services, particularly for patients with rare or complex conditions.
