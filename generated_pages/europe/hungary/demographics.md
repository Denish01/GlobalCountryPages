[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Hungary has a relatively small population compared to other European countries, with a total population of approximately 9.6 million people. The population growth rate is currently negative, with a decline of about 0.3% per year, due to a combination of low fertility rates and a high mortality rate. The country's population is also aging, with a median age of 42.7 years, which can put pressure on the pension system and healthcare services. Urbanization is a significant trend in Hungary, with about 71.4% of the population living in urban areas, with the capital city Budapest being the most populous.

The population of Hungary has been declining over the past few decades, with a significant decrease in the number of births and an increase in the number of deaths. This trend is expected to continue in the future, with the population projected to decline to around 8.5 million by 2050. Migration patterns also play a role in Hungary's population dynamics, with many young and educated Hungarians moving abroad in search of better job opportunities. However, the country has also seen an increase in immigration in recent years, particularly from neighboring countries.

The population size of Hungary is also influenced by its geographic location and economic conditions. The country is landlocked, which can make it less attractive to foreign investors and immigrants. However, its strategic location in Central Europe also provides opportunities for trade and economic growth. Overall, the population of Hungary is facing significant challenges, including a declining population, an aging workforce, and a need for increased immigration to support economic growth.
