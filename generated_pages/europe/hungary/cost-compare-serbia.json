Hungary has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed economy, with a strong focus on services and industry. Serbia, on the other hand, has a smaller economy with a greater emphasis on agriculture and manufacturing. In terms of cost of living, Serbia is generally cheaper than Hungary, with lower prices for rent, food, and transportation. However, Hungary offers a more developed infrastructure and a higher standard of living, which may be attractive to expats and tourists.\n\nThe cost of living difference between the two countries is significant, with Serbia being approximately 15-20% cheaper than Hungary. This is largely due to the lower cost of rent, food, and transportation in Serbia. For example, a one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Belgrade, Serbia's capital, can cost around $400-500 per month, while a similar apartment in Budapest, Hungary's capital, can cost around $600-700 per month. Similarly, meals at restaurants and groceries are generally cheaper in Serbia than in Hungary.
