  "content": "Hungary is governed as a **unitary parliamentary republic**, with a system that combines elements of democracy and constitutionalism to ensure the representation of its citizens and the protection of their rights.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Parliamentary Republic\nHead of State: President (Katalin Novák)\nHead of Government: Prime Minister (Viktor Orbán)\nLegislature: National Assembly, unicameral with 199 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 46th out of 178 countries in the 2021 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 64th out of 180 countries in the 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Hungary operates on the principle of **separation of powers**, dividing authority among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The **National Assembly**, the country's unicameral legislature, is composed of 199 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **President** serves as the head of state, with ceremonial and some constitutional powers, while the **Prime Minister** is the head of government, responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration. Hungary's political system is designed to ensure checks and balances among these branches, preventing any one branch from dominating the others.\n\nThe **unitary** nature of Hungary's government means that the central government holds significant power, with lesser autonomy granted to local governments. This structure allows for more centralized decision-making and policy implementation. However, the system also incorporates elements of **decentralization**, with local municipalities and counties having some degree of autonomy in managing local affairs.\n\nHungary's **constitutional framework** is based on the Constitution of Hungary, which was adopted in 2011. The Constitution outlines the principles of democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights, serving as the foundation for the country's legal and political system.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the Prime Minister | Viktor Orbán | Head of Government, oversees administration |\n| Executive | Cabinet | Ministers appointed by the Prime Minister | Implementation of government policies |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | László Kövér (Speaker) | Lawmaking, oversight of the executive |\n| Judicial | Constitutional Court | Tamás Sulyok (President) | Interpretation of the Constitution, judicial review |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Péter Darák (President) | Highest court of appeal, ensures uniform application of laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fidesz | Right-wing, nationalist | Viktor Orbán | 135 | Dominant party in the current government |\n| Democratic Coalition | Center-left, liberal | Ferenc Gyurcsány | 15 | Major opposition party |\n| Momentum Movement | Center-left, liberal | András Fekete-Győr | 10 | Young, progressive party |\n| Jobbik | Right-wing, nationalist | Péter Jakab | 17 | Originally a far-right party, now more moderate |\n| MSZP | Center-left, social democratic | Bertalan Tóth | 15 | Traditional social democratic party |\n| LMP | Green, liberal | Máté Kanász-Nagy and Erzsébet Schmuck | 5 | Focus on environmental and social issues |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Hungary is based on a **mixed model**, combining elements of proportional representation and single-member districts.\n- National Assembly elections are held every four years, with the last election taking place in 2022.\n- The next National Assembly election is scheduled for 2026.\n- Voter participation in Hungarian elections has been around 70%, with variations in different electoral cycles.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Hungary's current political climate is characterized by a dominant **right-wing government**, with Fidesz holding a significant majority in the National Assembly.\n- Key issues facing the country include **migration policy**, with Hungary taking a strong stance against immigration, and **EU relations**, as the country navigates its position within the European Union.\n- Regional dynamics, particularly relations with neighboring countries and the influence of **Russian foreign policy**, play a significant role in Hungary's geopolitical landscape.\n- Freedom indices, such as the **Press Freedom Index** and the **Democracy Index**, have noted concerns regarding the erosion of democratic norms and media freedom in Hungary.\n- The country faces challenges in balancing its **economic growth** with social welfare and environmental protection.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Hungary is a member of the **European Union** and the **North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**, aligning its foreign policy with these organizations' principles.\n- The country maintains **good relations** with its neighbors, although historical and current issues, such as border disputes and minority rights, occasionally strain these relationships.\n- Hungary has been strengthening its **ties with China**, participating in the Belt and Road Initiative and enhancing economic cooperation.\n- The country's **diplomatic stance** on international issues often reflects its commitment to national sovereignty and its historical and cultural ties with other European nations.\n- Hungary is also a member of the **Visegrád Group**, a regional alliance with the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia, aiming to promote cooperation among these Central European countries.",
