  "content": "Healthcare in Hungary is a universal system that provides comprehensive coverage to its citizens, with a mix of public and private providers, and is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-equipped hospitals and a wide range of medical specialties available.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal/Mixed\nQuality Rating: 4/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nHungary's healthcare system is based on a universal health insurance model, where every citizen is entitled to healthcare services, including medical treatment, hospital care, and pharmaceuticals. The system is funded through a combination of government subsidies, social insurance contributions, and out-of-pocket payments. The public healthcare system is the primary provider of healthcare services, but there are also private healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics, that offer specialized services. The quality of care in Hungary is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical equipment. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped hospitals and a wider range of medical specialties available.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Hungary is free for citizens, but there may be some out-of-pocket costs for certain services, such as prescription medications and dental care. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, typically require payment upfront, although some may offer package deals or discounts for certain services. Overall, Hungary's healthcare system is well-organized and provides comprehensive coverage to its citizens, but there can be some challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to specialized care may be limited.\n\nHungary's healthcare system is also subject to the European Union's (EU) healthcare directives, which provide a framework for the provision of healthcare services across the EU. This means that EU citizens can access healthcare services in Hungary, and Hungarian citizens can access healthcare services in other EU countries, under certain conditions. This has helped to improve the quality of care and increase access to specialized services, particularly for patients with rare or complex conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| St. Istvan Hospital | Budapest | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Semmelweis University Hospital | Budapest | Public | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Yes |\n| Buda Health Center | Budapest | Private | General medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy | Yes |\n| Debrecen University Hospital | Debrecen | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Szeged University Hospital | Szeged | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Medicover Hospital | Budapest | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for non-EU citizens and for those who want to access private healthcare services.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including the Hungarian National Health Insurance Fund (NEAK), which provides coverage for public healthcare services.\n- **Coverage for expats** is available through private insurance providers, which can provide comprehensive coverage, including access to private healthcare services.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the type of insurance and the level of coverage, but on average, a private health insurance policy can cost between 50,000-200,000 HUF (150-600 EUR) per month.\n- **EU Health Insurance Card** is accepted in Hungary, which provides coverage for EU citizens for emergency medical treatment.\n- **Supplementary insurance** is also available, which can provide additional coverage for services such as dental care, physiotherapy, and optical care.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Availability of medications** is generally good, with a wide range of prescription and over-the-counter medications available.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but most medications require a prescription from a licensed medical professional.\n- **Common brands** are available, including international brands and local generics.\n- **Costs** can vary, but on average, prescription medications can cost between 1,000-5,000 HUF (3-15 EUR) per month.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with pharmacies located throughout the country, including in urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), as well as tetanus and diphtheria.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis A and B, as well as influenza.\n- **Endemic diseases** include tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease, which are prevalent in rural areas.\n- **Water safety** is generally good, with tap water safe to drink in most areas.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, with a low risk of foodborne illnesses.\n- **Air pollution** can be a problem in urban areas, particularly during the winter months.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, dental care, and orthopedic surgery.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Semmelweis University Hospital and the St. Istvan Hospital, which offer a range of medical services, including surgery and rehabilitation.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with medical procedures often costing 50-70% less than in Western European countries.\n- **Language support** is generally good, with many medical professionals speaking English, particularly in private hospitals and clinics.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **What to do in an emergency** is to call the emergency number, 112, which will connect you to the emergency services.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with ambulances available throughout the country.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by calling the emergency number or by asking a local for directions.\n- **Insurance claims** can be made through your insurance provider, which can help to cover the costs of emergency medical treatment.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, particularly if you require specialized care that is not available in Hungary.",
