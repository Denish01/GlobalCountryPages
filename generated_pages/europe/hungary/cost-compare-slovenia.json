However, Slovenia has a higher standard of living and a more developed economy, which is reflected in its higher GDP per capita.\n\nThe cost of living difference between Hungary and Slovenia is significant, with Hungary being around 20-30% cheaper overall. This makes Hungary an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees who are looking for a affordable and culturally rich destination. However, Slovenia's higher standard of living and more developed economy may make it a more desirable option for those who value convenience, quality of life, and access to modern amenities. In terms of specific costs, Hungary has lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation, while Slovenia has higher prices for these categories.
