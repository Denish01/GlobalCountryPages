Public education is free and available to all citizens, while private schools and universities charge tuition fees.

The education system in Hungary is also known for its **dual education system**, which combines theoretical and practical training in vocational schools. This system provides students with a strong foundation in their chosen field and prepares them for the labor market. Additionally, Hungary has a growing number of international schools and universities that offer programs taught in foreign languages, such as English, German, and French.
