[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Hungary is relatively stable, with a mix of old and new buildings available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a security deposit of 2-3 months' rent usually required. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have a written contract outlining the terms of the lease. Compared to its regional neighbors, Hungary's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Austria or Slovenia, but higher than in Ukraine or Serbia.

The Hungarian housing market has experienced some fluctuations in recent years, with a slight increase in prices due to the country's growing economy and tourism industry. However, the market remains relatively affordable, especially outside of the capital city Budapest. The government has implemented various initiatives to support affordable housing, including subsidies for first-time homebuyers and rent control measures. Despite these efforts, there is still a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly in the capital city.
