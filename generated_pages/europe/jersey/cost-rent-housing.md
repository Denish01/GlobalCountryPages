[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Jersey is highly competitive, with a limited supply of properties available, particularly in the city center of Saint Helier. Typical lease terms are for a minimum of 12 months, and tenants are usually required to pay a deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by the **Rent Control Law**, which regulates rent increases and provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Jersey's housing costs are significantly higher, with prices similar to those found in London or other major European cities.

The high demand for housing in Jersey is driven by its **low unemployment rate** and **high standard of living**, making it an attractive destination for expats and locals alike. However, this demand has also led to a shortage of affordable housing options, particularly for low-income households. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this issue, including the development of **affordable housing schemes** and **rent control measures**. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Jersey remains highly competitive, and renters need to be prepared to act quickly when a suitable property becomes available.
