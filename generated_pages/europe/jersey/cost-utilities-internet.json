  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Jersey can vary depending on factors such as apartment size and usage, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($40 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.20 per kWh)\nCurrency: GBP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nJersey's utility infrastructure is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. The costs of utilities in Jersey are generally stable, with minimal fluctuations throughout the year. However, there may be some seasonal variation in electricity and gas costs, with higher prices during the winter months due to increased demand. The Jersey Electricity Company and Jersey Gas are the main providers of electricity and gas, while the States of Jersey is responsible for providing water and sewage services.\n\nThe costs of utilities in Jersey are also influenced by the island's location and its dependence on imported fuel. As a result, prices may be higher than in other parts of the UK. However, the island's mild climate and relatively low energy consumption help to keep costs down. It's worth noting that Jersey has a number of initiatives in place to promote energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, including grants for solar panels and energy-efficient appliances.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | average cost per month |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | includes sewage and waste disposal |\n| Gas / Heating | $30 | $50 | $70 | average cost per month |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | includes recycling and waste collection |\n| **Total** | **$140** | **$215** | **$280** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-$40 | 30 Mbps | Jersey Telecom, Sure |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-$60 | 100 Mbps | Jersey Telecom, Sure |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-$20 | 5 GB | Jersey Telecom, Airtel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$30 | 10 GB | Jersey Telecom, Airtel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $60-$80 | varies | Jersey Telecom, Sure |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in Jersey |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Jersey |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | available through Jersey Telecom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Jersey, you will need to contact the relevant providers, such as Jersey Electricity and Jersey Gas, and provide proof of address and identity.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available in some areas, but postpaid plans are more common.\n- Jersey Telecom and Sure are the main internet providers in Jersey, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and insulating your home.\n- It's also worth considering a phone and internet bundle, which can often be cheaper than separate plans.",
