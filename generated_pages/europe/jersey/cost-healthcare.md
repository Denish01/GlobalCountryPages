[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Jersey's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining elements of both public and private healthcare. The public system, funded through taxation and social security contributions, provides comprehensive coverage for locals, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, foreigners and expats may need to purchase private health insurance to access these services. The quality of public healthcare in Jersey is generally high, with well-equipped hospitals and skilled medical professionals. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers more specialized and personalized services, but at a higher cost. Locals can access public healthcare services for free or at a reduced cost, while foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket or rely on their private insurance.

The healthcare system in Jersey is designed to provide universal access to essential healthcare services, but the level of coverage and cost can vary significantly depending on whether you are a local or a foreigner. Locals are generally entitled to free or low-cost public healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. Foreigners, on the other hand, may need to purchase private health insurance to access these services, which can be more expensive. However, some employers may offer private health insurance as part of their benefits package, and some private insurance plans may offer more comprehensive coverage, including access to specialized services and higher-quality facilities.
