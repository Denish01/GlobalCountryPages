Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Jersey before traveling. [/CALLOOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nJersey has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter the island without a visa. As a British Crown dependency, Jersey's visa policy is closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom, and visitors who are eligible to enter the UK without a visa are often also eligible to enter Jersey. Citizens of over 50 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, and many European nations, can enter Jersey visa-free for tourism or business purposes. However, some nationalities may require a visa or other documentation, such as an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) or a paper visa.\n\nJersey's visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate travel and tourism. The island's government has implemented a range of measures to ensure that visitors can enter the island quickly and easily, while also maintaining the security and integrity of the island's borders. Visitors who are eligible for visa-free entry can typically stay in Jersey for up to six months, although this may be subject to certain conditions and restrictions.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | No visa required for tourism or business |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | No visa required, but may need to show proof of citizenship |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | No visa required, but may need to show proof of citizenship |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | No visa required for tourism or business |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | No visa required for tourism or business |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Paper Visa | 6 months | Must apply for a visa at a UK embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Paper Visa | 6 months | Must apply for a visa at a UK embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically enter Jersey without a visa, and can stay for up to six months.
