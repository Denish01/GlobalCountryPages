[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Switzerland has a **territorial taxation** system, where taxes are levied by the federal government and the cantons, with each canton having its own tax laws and regulations. This results in a complex tax landscape, as tax rates and rules can vary significantly between cantons. For individuals, tax residency is determined by their **domicile**, which is the place where they have their permanent home, or their **residence**, which is the place where they stay for a certain period. Non-resident individuals are taxed only on their Swiss-sourced income.

The Swiss tax system is known for its **federalism**, with the federal government and the cantons sharing tax revenue. The federal government levies a **federal income tax**, while the cantons levy **cantonal income tax** and **communal income tax**. This shared tax system allows for a degree of **tax competition** between cantons, as they can set their own tax rates to attract businesses and individuals. Overall, Switzerland's tax system is designed to be **neutral**, meaning that it does not favor one type of income or activity over another.
