[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Switzerland has a high-quality education system, with both public and private schools offering excellent instruction. The public education system is generally considered to be of high quality, with students attending school for 11 years, from age 6 to 17. The language of instruction varies depending on the region, with German, French, Italian, and Romansh being the four official languages. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB), British, and American programs. These schools cater to expatriate families and offer a global perspective, but can be quite expensive.

The quality of education in Switzerland is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** subjects, as well as languages and humanities. The country's unique cultural and linguistic diversity provides a rich learning environment, with opportunities for students to learn multiple languages and engage with different cultures.
