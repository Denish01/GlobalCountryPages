The cantons are further divided into districts, which are then divided into municipalities. This system allows for a high degree of autonomy and self-governance, with the federal government responsible for matters such as foreign policy, defense, and national infrastructure. The cantons, on the other hand, are responsible for matters such as education, healthcare, and transportation.\n\nThe division of Switzerland into cantons dates back to the 13th century, when the country was formed as a confederation of independent states. Over time, the cantons have developed distinct cultural, linguistic, and economic identities, which are still evident today. For example, the canton of Geneva is known for its international diplomatic community, while the canton of Zurich is a major financial hub.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Zurich** (434,335)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning lakefront, historic Old Town, and vibrant arts and culture scene\nBest For: business travelers, cultural enthusiasts, and those interested in history and architecture\n\n**Geneva** (203,856)\nRole: international diplomatic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its picturesque lakeside setting, historic landmarks such as the Jet d'Eau, and international organizations such as the UN and Red Cross\nBest For: diplomats, international business travelers, and those interested in history and politics\n\n**Bern** (134,794)\nRole: capital city, cultural center\nKnown For: its well-preserved medieval Old Town, historic landmarks such as the Zytglogge clock tower, and vibrant arts and culture scene\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and those interested in politics and government\n\n**Basel** (173,693)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its vibrant arts and culture scene, historic landmarks such as the Basel Minster, and international trade fairs\nBest For: cultural enthusiasts, business travelers, and those interested in history and architecture\n\n**Lausanne** (139,111)\nRole: cultural center, educational hub\nKnown For: its stunning lakeside setting, historic landmarks such as the Lausanne Cathedral, and prestigious universities such as the University of Lausanne\nBest For: students, cultural enthusiasts, and those interested in history and education\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Swiss Plateau | flat, urbanized | industry, finance, culture | Zurich |\n| Alps | mountainous, rural | skiing, hiking, tourism | Interlaken |\n| Jura | hilly, rural | watchmaking, agriculture | La Chaux-de-Fonds |\n| Ticino | southern, Mediterranean | tourism, cuisine, culture | Lugano |\n| Valais | mountainous, rural | skiing, hiking, wine production | Sion |\n| Graubünden | mountainous, rural | skiing, hiking, tourism | Chur |\n| Bernese Oberland | mountainous, rural | skiing, hiking, tourism | Interlaken |\n| Lake Geneva Region | lakeside, urbanized | tourism, culture, international organizations | Geneva |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The language spoken in each region varies, with German spoken in the north and east, French spoken in the west, Italian spoken in the south, and Romansh spoken in the southeastern canton of Grisons.\n- The economy of each region is also distinct, with the Swiss Plateau being a hub for industry and finance, while the Alps and other mountainous regions rely heavily on tourism and agriculture.\n- The culture of each region is shaped by its history, language, and geography, with the Swiss Plateau being known for its urbanized, cosmopolitan culture, while the Alps are known for their traditional, rural way of life.\n- The climate of each region varies, with the Swiss Plateau having a temperate climate, while the Alps have a cold, snowy climate in the winter and a mild, sunny climate in the summer.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nSwitzerland has a highly developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and driving options available.
