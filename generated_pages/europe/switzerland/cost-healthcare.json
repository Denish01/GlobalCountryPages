  "content": "In Switzerland, healthcare costs are relatively high, with a health expenditure per capita of $11,784, and individuals can expect to pay around $200-$500 for a doctor's visit, depending on whether they choose public or private healthcare.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $11,784\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 22.0%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112 or 144\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: CHF\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSwitzerland has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and skilled medical professionals. However, the private healthcare system is also highly regarded, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-end services and amenities. For locals, the healthcare system is generally straightforward, with most people purchasing private health insurance to supplement the basic coverage provided by the government. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is often recommended that they purchase private health insurance to ensure access to the best medical care. In general, individuals are required to have health insurance in Switzerland, and there are penalties for those who do not have coverage.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Switzerland is generally high, with both public and private providers offering excellent medical care. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, with private providers often offering more luxurious amenities and more personalized service. In terms of cost, public healthcare is generally less expensive than private healthcare, although the costs can still be significant. For example, a doctor's visit at a public hospital may cost around $200-$300, while a private hospital may charge $500-$1000 or more for the same service. It's worth noting that prices can vary significantly depending on the city and region, with larger cities like Zurich and Geneva tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $200-$300 | $500-$1000 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $300-$500 | $1000-$2000 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $100-$200 | $200-$500 | |\n| Eye Exam | $100-$200 | $200-$500 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $500-$1000 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $1000-$2000 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $5000-$10,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $5000-$10,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $1000-$2000 | |\n| X-Ray | $100-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $300-$500 | Basic medical care, hospital stays, and some specialist services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $1000-$2000 | All medical services, including specialist care, hospital stays, and dental care |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1000 | Basic medical care, hospital stays, and some specialist services, with coverage abroad |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies, although some may require a doctor's prescription\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets\n- Common medications like pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $10-$50\n- More specialized medications can cost $50-$100 or more\n- Pharmacies are widely available in most cities and towns, although hours of operation may vary\n- It's generally recommended to have a prescription from a Swiss doctor to ensure that medications are covered by insurance\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, individuals should call 112 or 144 for emergency services.

For foreigners, it's often recommended to go to a private hospital, as they may have more English-speaking staff and be more accustomed to dealing with international patients. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Switzerland include the University Hospital Zurich and the Geneva University Hospitals. It's also a good idea to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including the embassy or consulate of your home country, in case of an emergency.
