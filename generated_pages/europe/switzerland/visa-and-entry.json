The country is a member of the Schengen Area, which means that visitors can travel to other Schengen countries without the need for additional visas. The visa-free policy allows nationals of eligible countries to stay in Switzerland for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Switzerland's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel while maintaining national security and immigration control.\n\nThe visa policy is based on the principle of reciprocity, which means that countries that have a similar visa policy towards Swiss citizens are more likely to have a favorable visa policy towards their nationals. Switzerland also has a points-based system for assessing visa applications, which takes into account factors such as the applicant's education, work experience, and language skills. The country's visa policy is regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains effective and efficient.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No visa required for tourism or business stays up to 90 days |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No visa required for tourism or business stays up to 90 days, but may need to register with the authorities |\n| EU Citizens | No | Free Movement | Unlimited | EU citizens have the right to live and work in Switzerland, but may need to register with the authorities |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No visa required for tourism or business stays up to 90 days |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No visa required for tourism or business stays up to 90 days |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist eVisa | 30 days | Must apply for a tourist eVisa online before arrival |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply for a tourist visa at a Swiss embassy or consulate before arrival |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Visitors who plan to stay in Switzerland for tourism purposes can enter the country without a visa if they are nationals of eligible countries.
