  "content": "Switzerland is home to a diverse population of approximately 9 million people, with a unique blend of cultures, languages, and ethnic groups.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 9 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.7%\nMedian Age: 42.5 years\nUrban Population: 74%\nPopulation Density: 220 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 83.5 years\nFertility Rate: 1.5 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe population of Switzerland has been steadily increasing over the years, with a growth rate of approximately 0.7% per annum. This growth is largely driven by **migration**, with many foreigners moving to the country for work or education. The total population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but the country's population density is high due to its limited geographical area. Urbanization is a significant trend in Switzerland, with around 74% of the population living in urban areas. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to a combination of natural increase and net migration.\n\nThe population of Switzerland is also characterized by a high level of **education** and a strong economy, with a highly developed service sector and a strong tradition of innovation. The country's population is also aging, with a median age of 42.5 years, which has implications for the labor market, healthcare, and social security systems. The population growth rate is also influenced by the country's **fertility rate**, which is relatively low at 1.5 children per woman. This has led to concerns about the long-term sustainability of the population and the potential impact on the economy and social security systems.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is also a significant factor in Switzerland's population dynamics, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards. This has led to the growth of urban agglomerations, such as Zurich and Geneva, which are now home to a significant proportion of the country's population. The country's population is also characterized by a high level of **mobility**, with many people moving to different parts of the country for work or education.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| German Swiss | 65% | Northern and eastern Switzerland | Predominantly Protestant |\n| French Swiss | 23% | Western Switzerland | Predominantly Catholic |\n| Italian Swiss | 8% | Southern Switzerland | Predominantly Catholic |\n| Romansh | 1% | Southeastern Switzerland | Official language in some cantons |\n| Foreigners | 25% | Throughout the country | Includes people from various European and non-European countries |\n| Other | 2% | Throughout the country | Includes people from other ethnic groups, such as Turks and Serbs |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Switzerland are diverse and reflect the country's complex history and geography.
