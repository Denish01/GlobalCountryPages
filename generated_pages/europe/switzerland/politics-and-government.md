[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Swiss government is based on the principles of federalism, direct democracy, and separation of powers. The federal government is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, defense, and national economy, while the cantons have significant autonomy in areas like education, healthcare, and taxation. The **separation of powers** is ensured by the division of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The federal government is headed by the **Federal Council**, a seven-member council that serves as the collective head of state and government. The **Federal Assembly**, the legislative branch, is composed of two chambers: the National Council and the Council of States.

The Swiss political system is characterized by its unique form of **direct democracy**, which allows citizens to participate directly in the decision-making process through referendums and initiatives. This system is designed to ensure that power is held by the people, rather than just the elected representatives. The **federal structure** of the government also allows for a significant degree of autonomy for the cantons, which are responsible for implementing federal laws and policies.

The **principle of neutrality** is also an important aspect of Swiss politics, with the country maintaining a long-standing tradition of neutrality in international relations. This principle is reflected in Switzerland's **foreign policy**, which is focused on promoting peace, stability, and cooperation in the region.
