[SECTION] How Switzerland Is Divided [/SECTION]
Switzerland is a federal republic divided into 26 cantons, each with its own constitution, government, and laws. The cantons are further divided into districts, which are then divided into municipalities. This system allows for a high degree of autonomy and self-governance, with the federal government responsible for matters such as foreign policy, defense, and national infrastructure. The cantons, on the other hand, are responsible for matters such as education, healthcare, and transportation.

The division of Switzerland into cantons dates back to the 13th century, when the country was formed as a confederation of independent states. Over time, the cantons have developed distinct cultural, linguistic, and economic identities, which are still evident today. For example, the canton of Geneva is known for its international diplomatic community, while the canton of Zurich is a major financial hub.
