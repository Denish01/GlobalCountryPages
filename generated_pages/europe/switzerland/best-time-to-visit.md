The wet season, which typically runs from May to November, is characterized by higher humidity and more frequent rainfall, making it ideal for hiking and exploring the countryside.

The shoulder season, which typically runs from April to May and September to October, is a great time to visit Switzerland, as the weather is mild and pleasant, and the crowds are smaller. The off-season, which typically runs from November to March, is the best time to visit Switzerland if you're on a budget, as prices for accommodations and tourist attractions are significantly lower.
