This results in a complex tax landscape, as tax rates and rules can vary significantly between cantons. For individuals, tax residency is determined by their **domicile**, which is the place where they have their permanent home, or their **residence**, which is the place where they stay for a certain period. Non-resident individuals are taxed only on their Swiss-sourced income.\n\nThe Swiss tax system is known for its **federalism**, with the federal government and the cantons sharing tax revenue. The federal government levies a **federal income tax**, while the cantons levy **cantonal income tax** and **communal income tax**. This shared tax system allows for a degree of **tax competition** between cantons, as they can set their own tax rates to attract businesses and individuals. Overall, Switzerland's tax system is designed to be **neutral**, meaning that it does not favor one type of income or activity over another.\n\n[SECTION] Personal Income Tax [/SECTION]\n| Income Bracket (CHF) | Tax Rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 - 14,000 | 0% |\n| 14,001 - 42,000 | 10% |\n| 42,001 - 80,000 | 11% |\n| 80,001 and above | 11.5% |\nTaxpayers in Switzerland can claim various **deductions** and **allowances**, such as deductions for mortgage interest, charitable donations, and **pension contributions**.
