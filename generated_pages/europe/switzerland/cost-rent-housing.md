[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Switzerland is highly competitive, with a limited supply of available apartments, especially in city centers. Typical lease terms range from 12 to 24 months, with a deposit requirement of 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are well-protected in Switzerland, with laws governing rent increases, eviction notices, and maintenance responsibilities. Compared to its regional neighbors, Switzerland's housing costs are among the highest, with prices in cities like Zurich and Geneva rivaling those in major European capitals like London and Paris. The country's strong economy, high standard of living, and limited housing supply contribute to its expensive housing market.

The Swiss housing market is also characterized by a strong emphasis on quality and safety, with strict building codes and regulations in place. This can make it difficult for landlords to find tenants willing to pay high rents, but it also ensures that renters have access to well-maintained and safe living spaces. Additionally, the country's **pro-renter laws** and **tenant protection** measures provide a high level of security for renters, making it an attractive option for those looking for a stable and secure living situation.
