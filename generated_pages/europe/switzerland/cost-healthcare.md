[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Switzerland has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and skilled medical professionals. However, the private healthcare system is also highly regarded, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-end services and amenities. For locals, the healthcare system is generally straightforward, with most people purchasing private health insurance to supplement the basic coverage provided by the government. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is often recommended that they purchase private health insurance to ensure access to the best medical care. In general, individuals are required to have health insurance in Switzerland, and there are penalties for those who do not have coverage.

The quality of healthcare in Switzerland is generally high, with both public and private providers offering excellent medical care. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, with private providers often offering more luxurious amenities and more personalized service. In terms of cost, public healthcare is generally less expensive than private healthcare, although the costs can still be significant. For example, a doctor's visit at a public hospital may cost around $200-$300, while a private hospital may charge $500-$1000 or more for the same service. It's worth noting that prices can vary significantly depending on the city and region, with larger cities like Zurich and Geneva tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.
