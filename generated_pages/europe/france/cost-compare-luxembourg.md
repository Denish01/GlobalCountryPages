[SECTION] Overview: France vs Luxembourg [/SECTION]
France and Luxembourg are two neighboring countries in Western Europe with distinct economic profiles. France has a large and diverse economy, with a strong service sector, a significant industrial base, and a substantial agricultural sector. Luxembourg, on the other hand, has a highly developed economy with a strong financial sector, a significant steel industry, and a growing technology sector. The cost of living in France is generally lower than in Luxembourg, mainly due to differences in housing costs, taxes, and the overall cost of living. France's GDP per capita is lower than Luxembourg's, but its inflation rate is higher, which can affect the purchasing power of consumers.
