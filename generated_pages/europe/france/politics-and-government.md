[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The French government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The president appoints the prime minister, who is responsible for overseeing the government's day-to-day operations. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly and the Senate, which are responsible for making laws. The **judicial branch** is independent of the other two branches and is responsible for interpreting the laws.

The French system of government is characterized by a **separation of powers**, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and checks on the other branches. This system is designed to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful and to ensure that power is distributed evenly throughout the government. France is a **unitary state**, meaning that the central government has significant powers and the regions have limited autonomy.

The French political system is also characterized by a strong tradition of **laïcité**, or secularism, which is enshrined in the constitution. This means that the government is separate from the church and that there is no official state religion. This has contributed to a strong sense of national identity and has helped to promote social cohesion.
