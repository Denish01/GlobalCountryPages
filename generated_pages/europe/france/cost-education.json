Public education is free or heavily subsidized for local students, and the quality is generally very high, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. Private education is also available, and while it can be more expensive, it often offers smaller class sizes and more individualized attention. The language of instruction is French, but many schools also offer courses in other languages, including English. Compulsory education in France lasts for 12 years, from the age of 6 to 18, and students typically attend primary school for 5 years, followed by 4 years of secondary school, and then 3 years of upper secondary school.\n\nInternational schools are also available in France, particularly in larger cities such as Paris, and these schools often offer a curriculum based on the International Baccalaureate (IB) or other international programs. These schools can be a good option for expat families who want their children to continue their education in a familiar language and curriculum. However, they can be quite expensive, with tuition fees ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 per year.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, emphasis on core subjects |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Smaller class sizes, more individualized attention |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Strong emphasis on academic preparation for university |\n| Private Secondary | $3,000-$7,000 | More extracurricular activities, better facilities |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | IB or other international curriculum, often with smaller class sizes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $200-$500 | $2,000-$5,000 | Low tuition fees for local students, higher for international students |\n| Private University | $5,000-$10,000 | $10,000-$20,000 | Often with smaller class sizes, more individualized attention |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000-$15,000 | $15,000-$30,000 | Universities such as the **University of Paris** or **École Polytechnique** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Varies depending on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $30-$75 | Can be helpful for students who need extra support |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Many language schools offer courses in French or other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies such as notebooks, pens, and pencils |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for many private and international schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The French education system is known for its high quality and is generally considered to be one of the best in the world.\n- **Scholarships** are available for international students, particularly those who demonstrate academic excellence or financial need.\n- **Online learning** options are becoming more popular in France, with many universities and schools offering online courses or degree programs.\n- Expats may want to consider enrolling their children in **international schools**, which can provide a more familiar curriculum and language of instruction.\n- The **University of Paris** is one of the top-ranked universities in France, and is known for its academic excellence and research opportunities.\n- Students who are not fluent in French may want to consider taking a **language course** before starting their studies in France.",
