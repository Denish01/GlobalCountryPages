[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
France has a **worldwide taxation** system, which means that residents are taxed on their global income, regardless of where it is earned. However, non-residents are only taxed on their French-sourced income. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must have their **domicile** or **residence** in France, or spend more than 183 days in the country in a calendar year. The tax system is administered by the **Direction Générale des Finances Publiques (DGFP)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services.

The French tax system is based on a **self-assessment** principle, which means that taxpayers are required to file their own tax returns and pay their taxes directly to the government. The tax year in France runs from January 1 to December 31, and tax returns must be filed by May 31 of the following year. Taxpayers can file their returns online or by mail, and they can also seek assistance from a tax professional or the DGFP.
