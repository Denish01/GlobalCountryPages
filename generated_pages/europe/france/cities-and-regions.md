[SECTION] How France Is Divided [/SECTION]
France is divided into 18 administrative regions, each with its own regional council and president. These regions are further divided into 101 departments, which are then subdivided into 36,769 communes, or municipalities. The country's administrative structure is designed to provide a balance between regional autonomy and national unity. The 18 regions are responsible for matters such as education, transportation, and economic development, while the national government handles issues like defense, foreign policy, and social welfare.

The division of France into regions is largely based on historical and cultural factors, with many regions corresponding to traditional provinces or linguistic areas. For example, the region of Brittany in northwest France has a distinct Celtic culture and language, while the region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur in southeastern France is known for its Mediterranean climate and stunning natural beauty. Understanding the regional divisions of France can help visitors appreciate the country's rich cultural diversity and plan their travels more effectively.
