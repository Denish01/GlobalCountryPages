  "content": "In France, the cost of healthcare is relatively high, with a health expenditure per capita of $5,327, but the country's universal healthcare system ensures that most medical expenses are covered, leaving patients with relatively low out-of-pocket costs.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $5,327\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 9.2%\nHealthcare System: Universal\nEmergency Number: 15\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nFrance has a universal healthcare system, which provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents. The system is primarily funded through payroll deductions and government subsidies, with patients typically paying a small fraction of the costs out-of-pocket. For locals, the system is generally easy to navigate, with most medical expenses covered by the national health insurance system, known as **Sécurité Sociale**. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is recommended that they purchase private health insurance to supplement the public system. Private healthcare providers are also available, offering higher-quality services and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe French healthcare system is considered one of the best in the world, with high-quality medical care and a wide range of services available. Public hospitals and clinics provide excellent care, but may have longer wait times and less comfortable facilities. Private hospitals and clinics, on the other hand, offer more luxurious amenities and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is essential to have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high, and the public system may not cover all expenses. It is also important to note that some medical procedures and services may not be covered by the public system, and patients may need to pay out-of-pocket or use private insurance to cover these costs.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $25-$50 | $50-$100 | Public system requires a referral from a GP for specialist care |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Private system allows direct access to specialists |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$60 | $60-$120 | Public system covers basic dental care, but private system offers more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$40 | $40-$80 | Public system covers basic eye exams, but private system offers more advanced testing |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$40 | Public system covers basic blood tests, but private system offers more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public system covers emergency care, but private system offers more comprehensive services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | Public system covers basic hospital care, but private system offers more luxurious amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Public system covers basic surgical procedures, but private system offers more advanced services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Public system covers basic maternity care, but private system offers more comprehensive services |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Public system covers basic imaging services, but private system offers more advanced testing |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public system covers basic imaging services, but private system offers more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public system coverage, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private system coverage, including specialist care, advanced procedures, and luxurious amenities |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Comprehensive coverage, including international medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary, but are generally lower than in the US, with prices starting at around $5-$10 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, with prices starting at around $5-$10 per medication\n- Pharmacies are abundant, with many locations open late and on weekends\n- Prescription rules are strict, with most medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Some medications may not be available in France, or may be available under a different name or formulation\n- It is essential to have a prescription from a licensed doctor to purchase medication, and to follow the instructions of the pharmacist or doctor\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 15, or visit the nearest hospital or clinic. Ambulance services are widely available, and emergency rooms are equipped to handle a wide range of medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is recommended to visit a hospital or clinic that has experience treating international patients, as they may have staff who speak English and are familiar with foreign medical systems. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in France include the **American Hospital of Paris** and the **Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou**. It is also essential to have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high, and the public system may not cover all expenses.
