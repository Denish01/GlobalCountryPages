[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in France is known for its high quality and reliability, with fast average internet speeds of 85 Mbps download, making it ideal for streaming, online gaming, and other data-intensive activities. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster internet speeds and better mobile network coverage available in cities like Paris, Lyon, and Marseille, compared to rural areas where speeds can be slower and coverage more limited. Despite this, the overall internet infrastructure in France is well-developed and reliable, with minimal downtime and fast repair times in case of outages.

In general, France's internet quality is on par with other developed European countries, with a strong focus on providing fast and reliable internet access to both urban and rural areas. The French government has implemented initiatives to improve internet access in rural areas, including investments in fiber-optic infrastructure and mobile network expansion. As a result, even in rural areas, internet access is widely available, although speeds may be slower than in cities.

To get a SIM card in France, tourists can visit a mobile carrier's store, such as Orange, SFR, or Bouygues Telecom, and purchase a prepaid SIM card with a tourist plan.
