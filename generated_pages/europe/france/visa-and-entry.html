        <h2>Visa Policy Overview</h2>
        <p>France has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. The country is a member of the Schengen Area, which allows for passport-free travel between certain European countries. Citizens of around 60 countries can enter France visa-free for up to 90 days, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain one on arrival. The French government has implemented various types of visas to cater to different purposes, including tourism, business, study, and work.</p>
        <p>The visa policy of France is designed to balance the need to facilitate international travel and trade with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration. The country has a well-developed visa application process, with a range of requirements and procedures in place to ensure that visitors meet the necessary criteria. Whether you're planning a short trip to Paris or a longer stay in the French countryside, it's essential to understand the visa requirements that apply to your situation.</p>
        <h2>Requirements By Nationality</h2>
        <p>| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |</p>
        <p>| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |</p>

        <h2>By Visitor Type</h2>
        <p><strong>Tourists:</strong> Visitors planning to stay in France for up to 90 days for tourism or business purposes may not need a visa, depending on their nationality. The typical stay for tourists is 30-60 days, but this can be extended in certain circumstances. To extend their stay, tourists must apply for a temporary residence permit (carte de séjour temporaire) at the local prefecture.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Travelers:</strong> Business travelers may need to provide additional documentation, such as an invitation letter from a French company or a certificate of employment. They may also need to apply for a specific type of visa, such as a <strong>business visa</strong> or a <strong>work visa</strong>. The requirements for business travelers vary depending on the purpose and duration of their stay.</p>
        <p><strong>Students:</strong> International students planning to study in France must apply for a <strong>student visa</strong> (visa étudiant) and provide proof of enrollment at a French university. The duration of the visa will depend on the length of their studies, and students may need to apply for a residence permit (carte de séjour) after arriving in France.</p>
        <p><strong>Workers:</strong> Workers planning to take up employment in France must apply for a <strong>work visa</strong> (visa travail) and provide proof of sponsorship from a French employer. The requirements for workers vary depending on the type of work and the duration of their stay.</p>
        <h2>Documents Checklist</h2>

        <li>A valid passport with at least six months' validity</li>

        <h2>Entry Points & Procedures</h2>
        <p>France has several major airports, including Paris Charles de Gaulle and Paris Orly, as well as numerous land borders with neighboring countries. When arriving in France, visitors will need to go through immigration and customs, where they will be required to present their passport and any necessary visas or documentation. The immigration process typically involves a brief interview with a border control officer, who will ask questions about the purpose and duration of the visit. Visitors may also be required to provide fingerprints or undergo a security screening.</p>
        <p>France also has a number of land borders with neighboring countries, including Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Spain, and Andorra. Visitors arriving by land will need to stop at a border crossing point, where they will be required to present their passport and any necessary visas or documentation. The border control process may vary depending on the country of origin and the purpose of the visit.</p>
        <h2>Common Mistakes To Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Not checking the validity of your passport before traveling</li>
        <li>Not applying for a visa in advance (if required)</li>
        <li>Not providing all necessary documentation (e.g. proof of funds, travel insurance)</li>
        <li>Not registering with the local authorities (if required)</li>
        <li>Not respecting the terms and conditions of your visa (e.g. overstaying, working without a permit)</li>
        <li>Not carrying a valid health insurance card (if required)</li>
        </ul>
