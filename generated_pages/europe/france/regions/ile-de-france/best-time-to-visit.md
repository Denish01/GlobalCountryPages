Ile-de-France, being a region in northern France, experiences a **temperate oceanic climate** with four distinct seasons. The region's climate is characterized by mild winters and warm summers, with significant rainfall throughout the year.

The region's climate is also influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, which helps to moderate the temperatures and prevent extreme weather conditions.
