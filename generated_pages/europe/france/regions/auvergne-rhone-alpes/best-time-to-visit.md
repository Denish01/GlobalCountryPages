[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes is a region in southeastern France, covering a diverse range of landscapes, from the **Alps** to the **Rhône Valley**. The region has a varied climate, with different zones experiencing distinct seasonal patterns. The mountainous areas have a cold, snowy climate in winter, while the lower-lying areas have a more temperate climate. The region experiences a **dry season** from June to September, with minimal rainfall, and a **wet season** from October to May, with more frequent rainfall. The seasons significantly affect travel, with winter being the best time for **skiing** and **snowboarding**, and summer being ideal for **hiking** and **cycling**.

The region's climate is also influenced by its proximity to the **Mediterranean Sea**, which brings warm air masses and contributes to the region's mild winters. However, the **Alps** create a rain shadow effect, resulting in a drier climate in the eastern part of the region. Understanding the regional climate patterns is essential for planning a trip to Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, as it can help travelers prepare for the weather conditions and make the most of their visit.

The seasonal variations in Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes also impact the region's **tourist infrastructure**, with many ski resorts and mountain towns closing during the off-season. However, this can be an advantage for travelers looking for a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices. The shoulder season, which includes the months of April, May, September, and October, offers a great balance between pleasant weather and smaller crowds, making it an ideal time to visit the region.
