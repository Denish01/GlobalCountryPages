[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes is part of the French national healthcare system, which is considered one of the best in the world. The system is primarily public, with a strong network of public hospitals and clinics, as well as a smaller number of private facilities. The quality of care is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. Access to healthcare is widespread, with facilities available in both urban and rural areas, although some specialized services may only be available in larger cities.

The French healthcare system is based on a **social security** model, where residents contribute to the system through payroll taxes and receive comprehensive coverage in return. The system is designed to provide universal access to healthcare, regardless of income or social status. In Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, this means that residents have access to a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications.

Despite the many strengths of the healthcare system in Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, there are some challenges, particularly in rural areas where access to specialized services can be limited. However, overall, the region offers a high level of healthcare quality and accessibility, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike.
