[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, a region in southeastern France, has a **Mediterranean climate** with warm summers and mild winters. The region can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal area, the mountains, and the inland region. The coastal area has a mild climate year-round, with average temperatures ranging from 12°C to 25°C. The mountainous regions, such as the **Alpes-Maritimes**, have a colder climate, with significant snowfall during the winter months. The inland region, including the **Provence** area, has a more extreme climate, with hot summers and cold winters.

The region experiences a **dry season** from June to September, with very little rainfall, and a **wet season** from October to May, with most of the rainfall occurring during the winter months. The dry season is the peak tourist season, with warm weather and long days, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and swimming. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with cooler weather and shorter days, making it ideal for indoor activities such as museum visits and wine tastings.

The seasons significantly affect travel in Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. During the peak season, popular destinations such as **Saint-Tropez** and **Cannes** can get very crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher. During the low season, many tourist facilities and attractions may be closed, and some roads in the mountainous regions may be inaccessible due to snow.
