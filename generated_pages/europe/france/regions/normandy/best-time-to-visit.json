  "content": "The best time to visit Normandy is during the spring and summer months when the weather is mild and pleasant, making it ideal for exploring the region's historic sites, beaches, and countryside.\n\n[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Normandy: June to September. Peak season: July and August. Budget season: April to May and September to October. Avoid: December to February due to cold and wet weather, and possible closures of some tourist attractions. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nNormandy, a region in northern France, has a **temperate oceanic climate**, characterized by mild winters and cool summers. The region experiences a significant amount of rainfall throughout the year, with the most precipitation occurring during the winter months. The climate is influenced by its proximity to the English Channel, which helps to moderate the temperature and precipitation patterns. The region can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal area, which has a milder climate, and the inland area, which has a more continental climate.\n\nThe **dry season** in Normandy typically occurs during the summer months, from June to September, when the weather is warmer and drier. This is the best time to visit the region's beaches, such as **Deauville** and **Trouville**, and to explore the countryside. The **wet season**, which occurs from October to May, is characterized by more frequent rainfall and cooler temperatures. During this time, it's best to focus on visiting the region's historic sites, such as the **D-Day beaches** and the **Mont-Saint-Michel**, which are less affected by the weather.\n\nThe seasons in Normandy have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season attracting large crowds and higher prices. The shoulder season, which occurs during the spring and autumn, offers a good balance between pleasant weather and smaller crowds. The off-season, which occurs during the winter, is the best time to find discounts and special deals, but some tourist attractions may be closed or have limited hours.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Visiting museums and indoor attractions |\n| February | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Exploring the region's historic sites |\n| March | Mild and wet | Med | $$ | Visiting the countryside and beaches |\n| April | Mild and wet | Med | $$ | Attending festivals and events |\n| May | Mild and sunny | Med | $$ | Exploring the region's gardens and parks |\n| June | Warm and sunny | High | $$$ | Visiting the beaches and enjoying outdoor activities |\n| July | Warm and sunny | High | $$$ | Attending festivals and events |\n| August | Warm and sunny | High | $$$ | Enjoying the region's summer events and activities |\n| September | Mild and sunny | Med | $$ | Visiting the countryside and beaches |\n| October | Cool and wet | Med | $$ | Exploring the region's historic sites |\n| November | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Visiting museums and indoor attractions |\n| December | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Enjoying the region's Christmas markets and festivities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| D-Day Commemorations | June | Ceremonies and events to commemorate the D-Day landings |\n| Deauville American Film Festival | September | A film festival showcasing American and French films |\n| Normandy Impressionist Festival | April to September | A festival celebrating the region's Impressionist heritage |\n| Bayeux Medieval Festival | July | A festival showcasing the region's medieval history and culture |\n| Mont-Saint-Michel Festival | August | A festival celebrating the region's music and dance heritage |\n| Rouen Armada | June | A festival celebrating the region's maritime heritage |\n| Normandy Gastronomy Festival | October | A festival showcasing the region's culinary delights |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **coastal area**, which includes cities such as Deauville and Trouville, has a milder climate and is more popular during the summer months.\n- The **inland area**, which includes cities such as Caen and Rouen, has a more continental climate and is more popular during the spring and autumn.\n- The **Mont-Saint-Michel** area, which is located in the south of the region, has a unique microclimate and is popular year-round.\n- The **D-Day beaches** area, which is located in the north of the region, is popular during the summer months and during the D-Day commemorations in June.\n- The **Norman countryside**, which is located throughout the region, is popular during the spring and autumn when the weather is mild and pleasant.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tourist attractions in advance, especially during the peak season.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, when the weather is still pleasant and the crowds are smaller.\n- Pack layers, as the weather in Normandy can be unpredictable and cool, even during the summer.\n- Don't forget to try some of the region's delicious cuisine, including **Norman cheese** and **Calvados**.\n- Be aware of the region's holidays and festivals, which can affect the opening hours of tourist attractions and the availability of accommodations.\n- Consider purchasing a **Normandy Pass**, which grants access to many of the region's tourist attractions and public transportation.",
