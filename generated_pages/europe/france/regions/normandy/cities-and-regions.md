[SECTION] How Normandy Is Divided [/SECTION]
Normandy is divided into five administrative departments: Calvados, Eure, Manche, Orne, and Seine-Maritime. These departments are further divided into 1,433 communes, which are the smallest administrative units in France. The region is also divided into two main areas: Upper Normandy, which includes the departments of Seine-Maritime and Eure, and Lower Normandy, which includes the departments of Calvados, Manche, and Orne. This division is not only administrative but also reflects the cultural and historical differences between the two areas.

The administrative structure of Normandy is designed to provide a framework for local governance and decision-making. Each department has its own prefecture, which is the capital city of the department, and is responsible for implementing national policies and providing local services. The region as a whole is governed by a regional council, which is composed of elected representatives from each department. This council is responsible for promoting the economic and cultural development of the region, as well as providing support for local initiatives and projects.
