[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Normandy, a region in northern France, has a **temperate oceanic climate**, characterized by mild winters and cool summers. The region experiences a significant amount of rainfall throughout the year, with the most precipitation occurring during the winter months. The climate is influenced by its proximity to the English Channel, which helps to moderate the temperature and precipitation patterns. The region can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal area, which has a milder climate, and the inland area, which has a more continental climate.

The **dry season** in Normandy typically occurs during the summer months, from June to September, when the weather is warmer and drier. This is the best time to visit the region's beaches, such as **Deauville** and **Trouville**, and to explore the countryside. The **wet season**, which occurs from October to May, is characterized by more frequent rainfall and cooler temperatures. During this time, it's best to focus on visiting the region's historic sites, such as the **D-Day beaches** and the **Mont-Saint-Michel**, which are less affected by the weather.

The seasons in Normandy have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season attracting large crowds and higher prices. The shoulder season, which occurs during the spring and autumn, offers a good balance between pleasant weather and smaller crowds. The off-season, which occurs during the winter, is the best time to find discounts and special deals, but some tourist attractions may be closed or have limited hours.
