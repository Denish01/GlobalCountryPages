[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Corsica is situated in the western Mediterranean Sea, approximately 160 kilometers southeast of the French mainland and 80 kilometers west of the Italian island of Sardinia. The island is part of the French Republic, with the capital city of Ajaccio located on the western coast. Corsica is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the east, south, and west, and is separated from the Italian island of Sardinia by the Strait of Bonifacio to the south.

The strategic location of Corsica has made it an important crossroads for trade and cultural exchange between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The island's proximity to the French mainland and its historical ties to Italy have also shaped its language, culture, and cuisine. Corsica's unique blend of French and Italian influences, combined with its stunning natural beauty, makes it a popular destination for tourists and travelers.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Corsica is a mountainous island, with a rugged terrain that is characterized by granite peaks, scenic valleys, and a diverse range of flora and fauna. The island's highest point, Monte Cinto, is located in the northern part of the island and is surrounded by a range of mountains that stretch across the interior. The landscape is also dotted with numerous rivers, streams, and lakes, including the Golo River, which is the longest river on the island.

The coastal areas of Corsica are characterized by a mix of sandy beaches, rocky coves, and scenic cliffs, with the eastern coast being generally more rugged and less developed than the western coast. The island's interior is also home to several forests, including the Corsican Mountains forest, which is a protected area that covers over 40% of the island. The diverse terrain and landscape of Corsica make it an ideal destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with a range of activities such as hiking, biking, and water sports available.

The island's unique geology has also created a number of natural wonders, including the Calanches de Piana, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that features a series of narrow, steep-sided valleys and towering cliffs. The Scandola Nature Reserve, which is located on the western coast of the island, is another protected area that is known for its stunning scenery and diverse wildlife.
