[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Corsica is part of the French national healthcare system, which is considered one of the best in the world. The system is universal, meaning that everyone has access to healthcare, regardless of their income or social status. The public sector provides the majority of healthcare services, with private clinics and hospitals also available. The quality of care is excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there can be some differences in access to healthcare between urban and rural areas, with more specialized services available in larger cities like Ajaccio and Bastia.

In general, the healthcare system in Corsica is well-organized and efficient, with a strong emphasis on preventive care. Residents and visitors can expect to receive high-quality medical care, including emergency services, hospital care, and outpatient treatments.
