[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Corsica has a Mediterranean climate with four distinct seasons. The island is divided into several climate zones, including the coastal areas, which have a milder climate, and the mountainous regions, which are cooler and more prone to snow. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, making it the best time to visit the island. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by cold and rainy weather, with most of the precipitation falling in the winter months. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season attracting large crowds and higher prices, while the off-season offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices.

The island's geography also plays a role in the seasons, with the mountainous regions experiencing a more extreme climate than the coastal areas. The **microclimate** of the island, which is influenced by the surrounding sea and the mountainous terrain, creates a unique and diverse range of ecosystems, from the lush forests to the arid landscapes. Understanding the seasons and climate zones is essential for planning a trip to Corsica, as it can help visitors make the most of their time on the island and enjoy the various activities and landscapes that it has to offer.

The seasons also affect the island's flora and fauna, with the spring and summer months being the best time to see the island's vibrant flowers and wildlife. The **maquis**, a type of scrubland that is unique to the Mediterranean region, is in full bloom during the spring and summer months, creating a colorful and fragrant landscape. The island's beaches, which are some of the most beautiful in the Mediterranean, are also at their best during the summer months, with warm and clear waters making them ideal for swimming and snorkeling.
