Corsica is a French region in the Mediterranean Sea, known for its stunning beaches, mountainous landscapes, and rich cultural heritage. The island has a reputation for being a safe and welcoming destination, with low crime rates compared to other European regions. However, as with any popular tourist spot, there are areas to be aware of and precautions to take to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip. Visitors can expect a strong police presence, particularly in tourist areas, and a general sense of security and community.

That being said, Corsica is not immune to the occasional petty crime, such as pickpocketing or theft, particularly in crowded areas or during peak tourist season.
