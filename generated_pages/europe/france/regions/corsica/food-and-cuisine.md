Corsica's cuisine is shaped by its strategic location in the Mediterranean, with French, Italian, and North African influences evident in its dishes. The island's rugged terrain and rich soil have also contributed to the development of a unique and flavorful cuisine, with a focus on local ingredients such as chestnuts, brocciu cheese, and lamb. Corsican cuisine is often characterized by its simplicity, heartiness, and emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients. Regional variations exist, with the northern part of the island known for its seafood dishes and the southern region famous for its meat and cheese specialties.

The island's history and cultural heritage have also played a significant role in shaping its cuisine.

From the **Pulenta**, a cornmeal porridge similar to Italian polenta, to the **Civet de Sanglier**, a rich wild boar stew, Corsican cuisine offers a wide range of exciting and flavorful dishes to explore.

Corsican cuisine is also closely tied to the island's traditions and customs.
