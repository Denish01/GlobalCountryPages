Peak season: July and August. Budget season: April and November. Avoid: January, February, and March due to cold and rainy weather, and December due to strong winds and rough seas. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nCorsica has a Mediterranean climate with four distinct seasons. The island is divided into several climate zones, including the coastal areas, which have a milder climate, and the mountainous regions, which are cooler and more prone to snow. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, making it the best time to visit the island. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by cold and rainy weather, with most of the precipitation falling in the winter months. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season attracting large crowds and higher prices, while the off-season offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices.\n\nThe island's geography also plays a role in the seasons, with the mountainous regions experiencing a more extreme climate than the coastal areas. The **microclimate** of the island, which is influenced by the surrounding sea and the mountainous terrain, creates a unique and diverse range of ecosystems, from the lush forests to the arid landscapes. Understanding the seasons and climate zones is essential for planning a trip to Corsica, as it can help visitors make the most of their time on the island and enjoy the various activities and landscapes that it has to offer.\n\nThe seasons also affect the island's flora and fauna, with the spring and summer months being the best time to see the island's vibrant flowers and wildlife. The **maquis**, a type of scrubland that is unique to the Mediterranean region, is in full bloom during the spring and summer months, creating a colorful and fragrant landscape. The island's beaches, which are some of the most beautiful in the Mediterranean, are also at their best during the summer months, with warm and clear waters making them ideal for swimming and snorkeling.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Avoid |\n| February | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Avoid |\n| March | Mild and sunny | Low | $ | Hiking and outdoor activities |\n| April | Mild and sunny | Medium | $$ | Spring flowers and festivals |\n| May | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Beaches and outdoor activities |\n| June | Warm and sunny | High | $$$ | Peak season and summer festivals |\n| July | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beaches and water sports |\n| August | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Peak season and summer festivals |\n| September | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Beaches and outdoor activities |\n| October | Mild and sunny | Medium | $$ | Autumn foliage and harvest festivals |\n| November | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Avoid |\n| December | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Avoid |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Corsica Festival | June | A celebration of Corsican music, dance, and culture |\n| Fête de la Musique | June | A music festival featuring local and international artists |\n| Fête de la Mer | July | A sea festival featuring boat races, water sports, and seafood |\n| Fête de l'Assomption | August | A religious festival featuring processions and traditional music |\n| Fête des Vendanges | September | A harvest festival featuring wine tastings and traditional food |\n| Fête de la Saint-Lucie | December | A Christmas market featuring local crafts and food |\n| Corsica Marathon | October | A marathon featuring a scenic route through the island's landscapes |\n| Fête de la Gastronomie | November | A food festival featuring local cuisine and wine |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **north coast** of Corsica, which includes the towns of Calvi and Bastia, has a milder climate than the south coast, making it a popular destination for visitors.\n- The **south coast**, which includes the towns of Bonifacio and Porto-Vecchio, is known for its beautiful beaches and clear waters, making it a popular destination for swimmers and snorkelers.\n- The **mountainous regions**, which include the towns of Corte and Sartène, have a cooler and more rugged climate, making them a popular destination for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts.\n- The **east coast**, which includes the towns of Solenzara and Ghisonaccia, is known for its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, such as hiking and kayaking.\n- The **west coast**, which includes the towns of Ajaccio and Propriano, is known for its beautiful beaches and clear waters, making it a popular destination for swimmers and snorkelers.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, which includes the months of April, May, September, and October, to avoid crowds and high prices.\n- Pack layers for your trip, as the weather can be unpredictable and cooler in the evenings, even during the summer months.\n- Bring **sun protection**, such as sunscreen and a hat, to protect yourself from the strong Mediterranean sun.\n- Avoid visiting during the winter months, which include January, February, and March, as the weather can be cold and rainy, and many tourist facilities may be closed.\n- Consider renting a car to explore the island, as public transportation can be limited, especially in rural areas.",
