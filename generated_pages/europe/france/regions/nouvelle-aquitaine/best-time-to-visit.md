[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Nouvelle-Aquitaine, a region in southwestern France, has a varied climate with different zones, including the Atlantic coastal area, the Pyrenees mountains, and the inland regions. The region experiences a temperate maritime climate, with mild winters and warm summers. The dry season, which runs from April to October, is characterized by low rainfall and pleasant temperatures, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, which runs from November to March, is marked by higher rainfall and cooler temperatures. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season attracting large crowds and higher prices, while the off-season offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices.

The region's climate is influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, which moderates the temperatures and precipitation patterns. The Pyrenees mountains create a rain shadow effect, resulting in a drier climate in the eastern part of the region. The inland regions have a more continental climate, with colder winters and warmer summers. Understanding the climate zones and seasons is essential for planning a trip to Nouvelle-Aquitaine, as it can help visitors make the most of their time and budget.

The seasons also affect the region's cultural and outdoor activities. During the peak season, the region hosts various festivals and events, such as the Bordeaux Wine Festival and the Bayonne Festival, which attract large crowds. The off-season, on the other hand, offers a more relaxed atmosphere, with fewer tourists and lower prices, making it an ideal time for outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, and surfing.
