Brittany is situated in the northwest of France, bordering the regions of Normandy to the northeast and Pays de la Loire to the southeast.

Brittany's strategic location has played a significant role in its history, with the region being an important center for trade and cultural exchange between France, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. The region's unique cultural identity has been shaped by its Celtic heritage, which is still evident in its language, music, and traditions.

The region's borders are largely defined by its natural geography, with the coastline playing a dominant role in shaping the landscape. The Brittany peninsula is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, with a series of rugged cliffs, sandy beaches, and rocky coves that have been shaped by the constant pounding of the sea. To the north, the English Channel separates Brittany from the United Kingdom, while to the south, the Bay of Biscay forms a natural boundary with the rest of France.
