The region is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the English Channel to the north, and the Bay of Biscay to the south. Brittany's strategic location has played a significant role in its history, with the region being an important center for trade and cultural exchange between France, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. The region's unique cultural identity has been shaped by its Celtic heritage, which is still evident in its language, music, and traditions.\n\nThe region's borders are largely defined by its natural geography, with the coastline playing a dominant role in shaping the landscape. The Brittany peninsula is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, with a series of rugged cliffs, sandy beaches, and rocky coves that have been shaped by the constant pounding of the sea. To the north, the English Channel separates Brittany from the United Kingdom, while to the south, the Bay of Biscay forms a natural boundary with the rest of France. The region's interior is characterized by a series of rolling hills, forests, and farmland, which have been cultivated for centuries.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nBrittany's landscape is characterized by a diverse range of terrain, including rugged coastlines, rolling hills, and vast forests.

The coastline is dotted with a series of picturesque fishing villages, such as Saint-Malo and Quiberon, which have been built into the rocky cliffs and offer breathtaking views of the ocean. Inland, the landscape is dominated by a series of rolling hills and farmland, which have been cultivated for centuries.\n\nThe region is also home to a number of forests, including the iconic Forest of Broceliande, which is steeped in legend and myth. The forest is said to be the final resting place of King Arthur, and is home to a number of ancient ruins and monuments that date back to the Middle Ages. The region's terrain is also dotted with a series of rivers, including the Vilaine and the Odet, which have played a significant role in shaping the landscape and supporting the local economy. The rivers have been used for centuries for fishing, trade, and transportation, and have helped to establish Brittany as a major center for commerce and industry.\n\nThe region's geology is also of interest, with a series of granite outcrops and rocky formations that have been shaped by millions of years of erosion.
