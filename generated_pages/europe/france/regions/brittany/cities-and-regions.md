[SECTION] How Brittany Is Divided [/SECTION]
Brittany is divided into four administrative departments: Côtes-d'Armor, Finistère, Ille-et-Vilaine, and Morbihan. Each department has its own unique character and contributes to the region's diverse cultural and economic landscape. The departments are further divided into arrondissements, cantons, and communes, with Rennes serving as the capital and economic hub of the region.

This unique geography has shaped the region's economy, culture, and language, with each department having its own distinct features and specialties.
