[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
France has a relatively high population density, with an average of 125 people per square kilometer. The population has been steadily increasing over the years, with a growth rate of 0.4% per annum. The country has a high urbanization rate, with approximately 85% of the population living in urban areas. The population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to a combination of natural increase and net migration. France has a long history of immigration, with many people moving to the country from other parts of Europe, as well as from North Africa and other regions.

The population of France is also characterized by a high life expectancy, with an average lifespan of 82 years. This is due to a combination of factors, including a high standard of living, good healthcare, and a strong social safety net. The fertility rate in France is relatively low, with an average of 1.8 children per woman, which is below the replacement rate. This has led to concerns about the impact of an aging population on the country's economy and social security system.

France's population is also becoming increasingly diverse, with a growing number of people from ethnic minority backgrounds. This has led to a more complex and multicultural society, with a wide range of languages, customs, and traditions. The government has implemented policies to promote integration and social cohesion, including language classes and job training programs for immigrants.
