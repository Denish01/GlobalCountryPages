[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The French education system is known for its high quality and is generally considered to be one of the best in the world. Public education is free or heavily subsidized for local students, and the quality is generally very high, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. Private education is also available, and while it can be more expensive, it often offers smaller class sizes and more individualized attention. The language of instruction is French, but many schools also offer courses in other languages, including English. Compulsory education in France lasts for 12 years, from the age of 6 to 18, and students typically attend primary school for 5 years, followed by 4 years of secondary school, and then 3 years of upper secondary school.

International schools are also available in France, particularly in larger cities such as Paris, and these schools often offer a curriculum based on the International Baccalaureate (IB) or other international programs. These schools can be a good option for expat families who want their children to continue their education in a familiar language and curriculum. However, they can be quite expensive, with tuition fees ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 per year.
