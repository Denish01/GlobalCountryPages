[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
France has a universal healthcare system, which provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents. The system is primarily funded through payroll deductions and government subsidies, with patients typically paying a small fraction of the costs out-of-pocket. For locals, the system is generally easy to navigate, with most medical expenses covered by the national health insurance system, known as **Sécurité Sociale**. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is recommended that they purchase private health insurance to supplement the public system. Private healthcare providers are also available, offering higher-quality services and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost.

The French healthcare system is considered one of the best in the world, with high-quality medical care and a wide range of services available. Public hospitals and clinics provide excellent care, but may have longer wait times and less comfortable facilities. Private hospitals and clinics, on the other hand, offer more luxurious amenities and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is essential to have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high, and the public system may not cover all expenses. It is also important to note that some medical procedures and services may not be covered by the public system, and patients may need to pay out-of-pocket or use private insurance to cover these costs.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 15, or visit the nearest hospital or clinic. Ambulance services are widely available, and emergency rooms are equipped to handle a wide range of medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is recommended to visit a hospital or clinic that has experience treating international patients, as they may have staff who speak English and are familiar with foreign medical systems. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in France include the **American Hospital of Paris** and the **Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou**. It is also essential to have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high, and the public system may not cover all expenses. [CALLOUT] It is crucial to note that emergency care is generally covered by the public system, but some services, such as ambulance transport, may require out-of-pocket payment.
