[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
France has a well-developed transportation system, with a wide range of options available to get around, including public transportation, taxis, ride-hailing services, and car rentals. The quality of public transit in France is generally high, with efficient and reliable bus, metro, and train networks connecting major cities and towns. Most people in France get around using public transportation, with many cities having comprehensive bus and metro systems, while others rely on commuter trains and bicycles.

The French transportation system is designed to be convenient and accessible, with many cities having dedicated bike lanes and pedestrian zones. The country's geography, with many major cities located along the coast or in valleys, also makes it easy to get around by train or bus. Additionally, France has a well-developed network of highways and roads, making it easy to drive or take a taxi. However, traffic in major cities like Paris can be heavy, and parking can be challenging, so it's often more convenient to use public transportation or walk or bike.
