        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>France has a high-income economy, characterized by a highly developed industrial base, a strong service sector, and a significant agricultural industry. The country's economy is driven by a combination of large, privately owned companies and a significant public sector, with the government playing a major role in key areas such as energy, transportation, and defense. France's economy is also highly integrated with the rest of Europe, with the country being a founding member of the European Union and the eurozone. The country's economic development level is considered to be very high, with a strong focus on research and development, innovation, and high-tech industries.</p>
        <p>France's economic trajectory has been marked by a period of steady growth, with the country's GDP having increased significantly over the past few decades. However, the country has also faced challenges such as high unemployment rates, particularly among young people, and a large public debt. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the business environment, reducing labor costs, and increasing competitiveness. Despite these challenges, France remains one of the world's largest economies, with a highly skilled workforce, a strong infrastructure, and a favorable business environment.</p>
        <p>The French economy is also characterized by a strong focus on social welfare and a high level of government intervention in key areas such as healthcare, education, and labor markets. The country's economic model is often described as a "mixed economy," with a combination of private and public ownership, and a significant role for the state in regulating key sectors. This approach has helped to maintain social stability and a high level of social cohesion, but has also been criticized for being overly bureaucratic and restrictive.</p>
