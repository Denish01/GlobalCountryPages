[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Isle of Man's healthcare system is a mix of public and private services, with the **National Health Service (NHS)** providing comprehensive and universal coverage to all residents. The NHS is funded through general taxation and provides a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. Private healthcare services are also available, offering additional options for those who can afford them. The quality of care in the Isle of Man is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there may be some differences in access to healthcare services between urban and rural areas, with more specialized services available in the capital city of Douglas.

The Isle of Man's healthcare system is also closely linked to the **United Kingdom's NHS**, with many medical professionals trained in the UK and many services modeled after the UK system. This close relationship ensures that the Isle of Man's healthcare system is well-integrated with international standards and best practices. Additionally, the Isle of Man has a relatively low population, which allows for a more personalized and community-based approach to healthcare.

Overall, the Isle of Man's healthcare system is well-regarded and provides high-quality medical care to its residents and visitors. With a mix of public and private services, the island offers a range of options for those seeking medical attention. However, it is still important for visitors to have adequate health insurance coverage, as some services may not be covered by the NHS.
