The House of Keys has 24 members, known as **Members of the House of Keys (MHKs)**, who are elected by the people of the Isle of Man for a five-year term. The Legislative Council, on the other hand, has 11 members, known as **Members of the Legislative Council (MLCs)**, who are elected by the House of Keys and serve for a five-year term. The Tynwald is responsible for making laws, approving the island's budget, and scrutinizing the government's policies.

The **executive branch** is headed by the Chief Minister, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of government policies. The **legislative branch** is responsible for making laws, while the **judicial branch** is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are applied fairly.
