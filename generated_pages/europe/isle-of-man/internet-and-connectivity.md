[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The Isle of Man's internet quality is generally good, with an average download speed of 23 Mbps, which is suitable for streaming, browsing, and online work. However, there is a notable urban vs rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in the capital Douglas and other major towns, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall reliability of the internet on the island is relatively high, with most users experiencing minimal downtime and few issues with connectivity.

The island's internet infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with the rollout of 5G networks and the expansion of fiber-optic broadband services. This has enabled faster and more reliable connections, particularly in urban areas, and has helped to support the growth of the island's digital economy. However, some rural areas may still experience slower speeds and more limited connectivity options, which can be a challenge for those living or working in these areas.
