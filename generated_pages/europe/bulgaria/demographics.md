[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Bulgaria's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, with a total of around 6.5 million people. The country has been experiencing a decline in population over the past few decades, with a negative population growth rate of -0.7% per year. This decline is largely due to a low fertility rate, which is currently at 1.4 children per woman, as well as a significant emigration of young and educated Bulgarians to other European countries. The urban population accounts for approximately 73.6% of the total population, with the majority of people living in cities such as Sofia, Plovdiv, and Varna.

The population of Bulgaria is also aging, with a median age of 43.7 years, which is one of the highest in the European Union. This aging population poses significant challenges for the country's pension system, healthcare, and social security. In terms of migration patterns, Bulgaria has seen a significant influx of migrants from neighboring countries, particularly from Syria and Afghanistan, although the numbers are still relatively small compared to other European countries.

In recent years, Bulgaria has also experienced a significant brain drain, with many young and educated Bulgarians emigrating to other European countries in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards. This has resulted in a significant loss of human capital, which poses significant challenges for the country's economic development and competitiveness.
