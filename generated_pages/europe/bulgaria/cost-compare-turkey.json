  "content": "Bulgaria is generally cheaper than Turkey, with an overall cost of living difference of around 20-30% in favor of Bulgaria.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nBulgaria GDP per Capita (PPP): 29,565\nTurkey GDP per Capita (PPP): 32,278\nBulgaria Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nTurkey Inflation Rate: 11.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Bulgaria\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Bulgaria vs Turkey [/SECTION]\nBulgaria and Turkey are two neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe, offering a unique blend of cultures, histories, and natural landscapes. In terms of cost of living, Bulgaria is generally considered to be more affordable than Turkey, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The economic context of both countries is also different, with Bulgaria being a member of the European Union and having a more stable economy, while Turkey has a more turbulent economy with higher inflation rates. Overall, Bulgaria is a more budget-friendly option for expats, students, and retirees, while Turkey offers a more vibrant and dynamic lifestyle, especially in its larger cities.\n\nThe cost of living difference between Bulgaria and Turkey can be attributed to several factors, including the exchange rate, economic stability, and government policies. Bulgaria's economy is more integrated with the European Union, which has led to a more stable currency and lower inflation rates. In contrast, Turkey's economy has been more volatile, with higher inflation rates and a fluctuating currency. As a result, prices for goods and services in Turkey are generally higher than in Bulgaria. However, Turkey offers a more diverse and vibrant cultural scene, with a rich history, stunning landscapes, and a unique blend of Eastern and Western influences.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bulgaria (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 350 | 29% more expensive in Turkey |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 200 | 25% more expensive in Turkey |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bulgaria (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 200 | 300 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n| Coffee | 1.5 | 2.5 | 40% more expensive in Turkey |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bulgaria (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.7 | 29% more expensive in Turkey |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bulgaria (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 80 | 120 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Turkey |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Bulgaria (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 700 | 29% savings in Bulgaria |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% savings in Bulgaria |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% savings in Bulgaria |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Bulgaria is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 30% lower than in Turkey\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices up to 33% lower than in Turkey\n  - Transportation, with monthly transit passes up to 33% cheaper than in Turkey\n  - Utilities and internet, with bills up to 33% lower than in Turkey\n- **Turkey is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain types of clothing and accessories, with prices up to 20% lower than in Bulgaria\n  - Electronics and gadgets, with prices up to 15% lower than in Bulgaria\n  - Travel and tourism, with prices up to 20% lower than in Bulgaria\n  - Certain types of entertainment, such as movie tickets and concerts, with prices up to 25% lower than in Bulgaria\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nBulgaria offers a more affordable lifestyle for expats, students, and retirees, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.
