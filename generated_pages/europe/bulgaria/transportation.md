[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Bulgaria has several international airports, with Sofia Airport being the largest and busiest, offering direct flights to many European cities, including London, Paris, and Amsterdam. The country is also accessible by land, with border crossings from neighboring countries such as Romania, Serbia, North Macedonia, Greece, and Turkey. You can enter Bulgaria by car, bus, or train, with the most popular overland entry points being the border crossings with Romania and Greece.

If you're planning to visit Bulgaria from outside of Europe, you may need to fly to a major European hub first and then connect to Sofia or another Bulgarian city. Some airlines, such as Bulgaria Air and Wizz Air, offer direct flights from European cities to Bulgarian destinations. Alternatively, you can take a bus or train from neighboring countries, which can be a more affordable and scenic option. For example, you can take a bus from Bucharest, Romania to Sofia, or a train from Thessaloniki, Greece to Plovdiv, Bulgaria.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Bulgaria has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights between the country's major cities. Bulgaria Air and Wizz Air are two of the main domestic airlines, offering flights from Sofia to Burgas, Varna, and Plovdiv. You can book domestic flights online through the airlines' websites or at a local travel agency. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $20 to $50, depending on the route and time of booking. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be quite expensive compared to bus or train travel, but they can save you time and offer a convenient way to travel between cities.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Bulgaria has a moderate rail network, with trains connecting the country's major cities, including Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas, and Varna. The rail network is operated by Bulgarian State Railways, which offers a range of train types, including express and regional trains. You can book train tickets online or at a local train station, with approximate costs ranging from $10 to $30 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and class of service. While Bulgaria's rail network is not as extensive as in some other European countries, it can be a convenient and affordable way to travel between cities, especially for shorter distances.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Bulgaria has an extensive network of intercity buses, with many private companies operating routes between the country's major cities. Some of the main bus companies include Union Ivkoni, FlixBus, and Eurolines, which offer frequent departures and relatively affordable prices. You can book bus tickets online or at a local bus station, with approximate costs ranging from $5 to $20 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and company. Bus travel can be a good option for shorter distances, but it may not be as comfortable as train or car travel for longer journeys.
