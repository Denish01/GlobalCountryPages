# The Truth About Bulgaria - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Bulgaria has a rich and complex history, with various empires and civilizations having ruled the region over the centuries. The **Thracians** were the first known inhabitants of the area, with the **Roman Empire** eventually conquering the region in 46 AD. The Roman Empire's division into Eastern (Byzantine) and Western halves led to Bulgaria being part of the **Byzantine Empire**. In the 7th century, **Slavic tribes** settled in the region, merging with the existing population to form the **First Bulgarian Empire** in 681 AD. This empire was recognized by the Byzantine Empire in 681 AD and existed until its conquest by the **Ottoman Empire** in 1396.
