The Thracians were a group of Indo-European tribes that developed a distinct culture and left a lasting legacy in the region. In the 1st century CE, Bulgaria was conquered by the **Roman Empire**, which brought significant economic, cultural, and administrative changes to the region. The Roman Empire's legacy can still be seen in Bulgaria's architecture, language, and traditions. With the decline of the Roman Empire, Bulgaria was invaded by various barbarian tribes, including the **Huns**, **Goths**, and **Slavs**, who eventually settled in the region and formed the foundation of the modern Bulgarian nation. In the 7th century CE, the **First Bulgarian Empire** was established, which marked the beginning of a new era in Bulgarian history.\n\nThe **Middle Ages** saw the rise and fall of the **Second Bulgarian Empire**, which was a period of significant cultural, economic, and territorial growth for Bulgaria.

The **National Revival** of the 18th and 19th centuries saw a resurgence of Bulgarian nationalism and a desire for independence from Ottoman rule.\n\nThe **modern era** has seen significant changes in Bulgaria, including the country's transition from a socialist to a democratic state. In 1989, Bulgaria's communist government was overthrown, and the country began a process of democratization and economic reform. Today, Bulgaria is a **sovereign state** and a member of the **European Union** and **NATO**, with a growing economy and a rich cultural heritage.
