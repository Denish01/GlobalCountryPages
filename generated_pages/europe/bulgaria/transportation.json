  "content": "To get around in Bulgaria, you can use a combination of public transportation options, including buses, trains, and taxis, as well as rent a car or use ride-hailing services, depending on your budget and preferences.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Sofia Airport (SOF), Burgas Airport (BOJ), Varna Airport (VAR)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: moderate\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: Bolt, TaxiMe\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nBulgaria has several international airports, with Sofia Airport being the largest and busiest, offering direct flights to many European cities, including London, Paris, and Amsterdam. The country is also accessible by land, with border crossings from neighboring countries such as Romania, Serbia, North Macedonia, Greece, and Turkey. You can enter Bulgaria by car, bus, or train, with the most popular overland entry points being the border crossings with Romania and Greece.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Bulgaria from outside of Europe, you may need to fly to a major European hub first and then connect to Sofia or another Bulgarian city. Some airlines, such as Bulgaria Air and Wizz Air, offer direct flights from European cities to Bulgarian destinations. Alternatively, you can take a bus or train from neighboring countries, which can be a more affordable and scenic option. For example, you can take a bus from Bucharest, Romania to Sofia, or a train from Thessaloniki, Greece to Plovdiv, Bulgaria.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nBulgaria has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights between the country's major cities. Bulgaria Air and Wizz Air are two of the main domestic airlines, offering flights from Sofia to Burgas, Varna, and Plovdiv. You can book domestic flights online through the airlines' websites or at a local travel agency. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $20 to $50, depending on the route and time of booking. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be quite expensive compared to bus or train travel, but they can save you time and offer a convenient way to travel between cities.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nBulgaria has a moderate rail network, with trains connecting the country's major cities, including Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas, and Varna. The rail network is operated by Bulgarian State Railways, which offers a range of train types, including express and regional trains. You can book train tickets online or at a local train station, with approximate costs ranging from $10 to $30 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and class of service. While Bulgaria's rail network is not as extensive as in some other European countries, it can be a convenient and affordable way to travel between cities, especially for shorter distances.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nBulgaria has an extensive network of intercity buses, with many private companies operating routes between the country's major cities. Some of the main bus companies include Union Ivkoni, FlixBus, and Eurolines, which offer frequent departures and relatively affordable prices. You can book bus tickets online or at a local bus station, with approximate costs ranging from $5 to $20 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and company. Bus travel can be a good option for shorter distances, but it may not be as comfortable as train or car travel for longer journeys.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | Sofia | $0.50 | Two lines, 18 stations |\n| City Bus | Most cities | $0.50-$1.00 | Frequent departures, affordable prices |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $0.50-$1.00/km | Metered taxis, relatively affordable |\n| Ride-Hailing | Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna | $2-$5 | Bolt and TaxiMe available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Not available | - | Not a common mode of transport in Bulgaria |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Bulgaria, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as car insurance that covers you in Bulgaria.\n- Road conditions in Bulgaria can be moderate, with some highways and main roads in good condition, but secondary roads can be poorly maintained.\n- Fuel costs in Bulgaria are relatively low, with gasoline and diesel prices averaging around $1.00 per liter.\n- If you plan to rent a car, it's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, and to choose a reputable rental company.\n- When driving in Bulgaria, be aware of potential hazards such as aggressive drivers, pedestrians, and livestock on the roads, especially in rural areas.\n- It's also a good idea to have a basic knowledge of Bulgarian traffic laws and signs, as well as a map or GPS device to help navigate the country's roads.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be careful when using taxis, as some drivers may try to overcharge you, and always make sure the meter is turned on before you start your journey.\n- When using public transportation, be prepared for crowds and limited English spoken by drivers or conductors.\n- It's a good idea to learn some basic Bulgarian phrases, such as \"hello\" (zdravei) and \"thank you\" (blagodarya), which can help you navigate transportation and other situations.\n- Be aware of your belongings, especially in crowded areas and public transportation, as pickpocketing and theft can occur.\n- Consider downloading a ride-hailing app, such as Bolt or TaxiMe, which can be a convenient way to get around cities.\n- When driving, be sure to follow local traffic laws and signs, and be prepared for unexpected hazards such as potholes or livestock on the roads.\n- It's also a good idea to have a basic emergency kit in your car, including a spare tire, flashlight, and first aid kit.",
