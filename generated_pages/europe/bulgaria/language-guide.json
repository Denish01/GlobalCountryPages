The language has its own unique alphabet, which is based on the Cyrillic script, and it is closely related to other Slavic languages such as Russian, Serbian, and Macedonian. There are several regional dialects spoken in Bulgaria, including the standard Bulgarian dialect, which is used in official contexts and is widely understood, as well as several regional dialects, such as the Shopi dialect spoken in the western part of the country and the Rhodope dialect spoken in the southern part of the country. Minority languages, such as Turkish and Romani, are also spoken in Bulgaria, particularly in areas with large minority populations. English is widely taught in schools and is becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger people, but it is still not as widely spoken as in some other European countries.\n\nDespite the growing popularity of English, it is still a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in Bulgarian, as many older Bulgarians and those in rural areas may not speak English fluently. Additionally, speaking some Bulgarian can go a long way in showing respect for the culture and people, and can help to enhance your overall travel experience. Bulgarian language is also used in all official contexts, including government, education, and media, and it is an important part of Bulgarian identity and culture.\n\nThe linguistic landscape of Bulgaria is also influenced by the country's history and geography. The country has been part of various empires and has been influenced by different cultures, including the Ottoman Empire, which ruled Bulgaria for nearly 500 years and left a lasting legacy on the language and culture. The country's strategic location in southeastern Europe has also made it an important crossroads for trade and cultural exchange, and has contributed to the development of a unique and diverse linguistic landscape.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Здравей (Zdravei) | ZDRAH-vay | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Здрасти (Zdrasti) | ZDRAH-stee | informal |\n| Thank you | Благодаря (Blagodarya) | BLAG-oh-DAH-ryah |  |\n| Please | Моля (Molya) | MOH-lyah |  |\n| Yes / No | Да / Не (Da / Ne) | DAH / NEH |  |\n| Excuse me | Извинете (Izvinete) | eez-vee-NEH-teh | formal |\n| Excuse me (informal) | Извини (Izvini) | eez-VEE-nee | informal |\n| How much? | Колко струва?
