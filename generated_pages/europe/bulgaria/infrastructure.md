Internet Penetration: 64%
Road Network: 19,512 km, moderate quality
Rail Network: 4,023 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Bulgaria's infrastructure development level is generally considered to be moderate, with significant gaps between urban and rural areas. The country has made significant investments in recent years to improve its transportation networks, including the construction of new highways and the modernization of its rail network. However, the quality of roads in rural areas remains a concern, and the country's energy sector is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Despite these challenges, Bulgaria has made significant progress in recent years, with the government investing heavily in infrastructure development and the country's EU membership providing access to significant funding opportunities.

The urban-rural gap in Bulgaria's infrastructure is a significant concern, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The government has launched several initiatives aimed at addressing these disparities, including programs to improve the quality of roads in rural areas and to increase access to broadband internet. However, more work needs to be done to address these challenges and to ensure that all citizens have access to the same level of infrastructure and services.

Bulgaria's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its EU membership, with the country receiving significant funding from the EU for infrastructure projects. This funding has been used to support a wide range of initiatives, including the construction of new highways, the modernization of the country's rail network, and the development of its energy sector. As a result, Bulgaria's infrastructure is becoming increasingly integrated with that of its EU neighbors, with the country playing an important role in regional transportation networks and energy systems.
