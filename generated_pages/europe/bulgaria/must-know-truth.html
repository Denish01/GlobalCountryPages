        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Bulgaria has a rich and complex history, with various empires and civilizations having ruled the region over the centuries. The <strong>Thracians</strong> were the first known inhabitants of the area, with the <strong>Roman Empire</strong> eventually conquering the region in 46 AD. The Roman Empire's division into Eastern (Byzantine) and Western halves led to Bulgaria being part of the <strong>Byzantine Empire</strong>. In the 7th century, <strong>Slavic tribes</strong> settled in the region, merging with the existing population to form the <strong>First Bulgarian Empire</strong> in 681 AD. This empire was recognized by the Byzantine Empire in 681 AD and existed until its conquest by the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> in 1396.</p>
        <p>The Ottoman Empire ruled Bulgaria for nearly five centuries, until the <strong>Liberation of Bulgaria</strong> in 1878, which led to the establishment of the <strong>Third Bulgarian State</strong>. Bulgaria declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire on September 22, 1908. During <strong>World War I</strong> and <strong>World War II</strong>, Bulgaria fought on the side of the <strong>Central Powers</strong> and the <strong>Axis Powers</strong>, respectively. Following World War II, Bulgaria became a <strong>socialist state</strong> and a member of the <strong>Eastern Bloc</strong>, with the <strong>Bulgarian Communist Party</strong> ruling the country from 1946 to 1989. In 1989, Bulgaria transitioned to a <strong>democratic government</strong> and has since become a member of the <strong>European Union</strong> and <strong>NATO</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's strategic location in Southeastern Europe has made it an important crossroads for trade and cultural exchange between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Bulgaria's history has been shaped by its geographic location, with the <strong>Balkan Mountains</strong> dividing the country into distinct regions. The <strong>Black Sea</strong> coastline has also played a significant role in Bulgaria's history, with the city of <strong>Varna</strong> serving as an important port and trading center.</p>
        <p>Bulgaria's history is characterized by a complex mix of cultures, with <strong>Orthodox Christianity</strong> being the dominant religion. The country has a rich cultural heritage, with numerous historical sites, including the <strong>Rila Monastery</strong> and the <strong>Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari</strong>, both of which are <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</strong>. Bulgaria's history has also been marked by significant events, such as the <strong>April Uprising</strong> of 1876 and the <strong>September Uprising</strong> of 1923.</p>
