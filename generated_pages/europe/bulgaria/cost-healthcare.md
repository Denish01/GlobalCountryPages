[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Bulgaria has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with longer wait times and less modern equipment, but it is also more affordable. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher quality services, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the first point of care, while foreigners may prefer to use private healthcare services. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.

The healthcare system in Bulgaria is generally well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical centers throughout the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of provider. In general, larger cities such as Sofia and Plovdiv tend to have better-equipped and staffed medical facilities, while smaller towns and rural areas may have more limited resources. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care in larger cities, where there are more English-speaking doctors and better-equipped facilities.
