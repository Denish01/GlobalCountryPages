[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Bulgaria's healthcare system is based on a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical equipment available in many hospitals and clinics. However, the quality of care can vary significantly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped and better-staffed medical facilities. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and private insurance, with many Bulgarians also purchasing private health insurance to supplement their public coverage.

The structure of the healthcare system in Bulgaria is decentralized, with each region having its own healthcare administration. This can sometimes lead to inconsistencies in the quality of care and access to medical services between different regions. Despite these challenges, Bulgaria has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services and improving the quality of care.

In general, medical care in Bulgaria is less expensive than in many other European countries, making it an attractive option for medical tourism. However, the system can be complex and bureaucratic, and language barriers can be a challenge for foreigners. Many medical professionals in Bulgaria speak some English, particularly in larger cities, but it is still a good idea to learn some basic Bulgarian phrases to help navigate the healthcare system.
