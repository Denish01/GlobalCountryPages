[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nBulgaria has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa. The country is a member of the European Union and the Schengen Area, but it has not yet fully implemented the Schengen Acquis. As a result, Bulgaria has its own visa policy, which is separate from the Schengen visa policy. Currently, citizens of around 60 countries can enter Bulgaria visa-free, including most European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan.\n\nThe visa policy of Bulgaria is designed to facilitate travel and tourism, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. The government has implemented various measures to simplify the visa application process, including the introduction of an electronic visa system for certain nationalities. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and travelers should always check with the official embassy or consulate of Bulgaria for the most up-to-date information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | Unlimited | Must have a valid passport or ID card |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at the embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at the embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Bulgaria visa-free for up to 90 days, provided they have a valid passport and proof of onward travel.
