The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with longer wait times and less modern equipment, but it is also more affordable. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher quality services, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the first point of care, while foreigners may prefer to use private healthcare services. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.\n\nThe healthcare system in Bulgaria is generally well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical centers throughout the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of provider. In general, larger cities such as Sofia and Plovdiv tend to have better-equipped and staffed medical facilities, while smaller towns and rural areas may have more limited resources. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care in larger cities, where there are more English-speaking doctors and better-equipped facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist care, procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Worldwide coverage, doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist care, procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost anywhere from $5 to $50 per month, depending on the type and quantity.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and generally affordable, with prices starting from $2-$5.\n- Pharmacies are common in larger cities and towns, but may be less available in rural areas.\n- Some pharmacies may offer delivery or online ordering services.\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with many medications requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics are widely available, but may require a prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112, which will connect you to a dispatcher who can send an ambulance or provide further instructions.
