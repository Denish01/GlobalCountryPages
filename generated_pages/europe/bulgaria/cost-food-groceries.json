The country's strategic location and fertile soil allow for a wide range of locally produced fruits, vegetables, and grains, which helps keep prices down. Eating out is a popular culture in Bulgaria, with many restaurants and cafes offering traditional dishes at affordable prices. However, home cooking is also common, and many locals prefer to buy fresh produce from open-air markets or supermarkets to prepare meals at home. The inflation rate of 2.5% in 2024 is relatively low, which means that food prices have been stable, and the cost of living in Bulgaria remains relatively affordable.\n\nThe cost of food in Bulgaria can vary depending on the location, with cities like Sofia and Plovdiv tend to have higher prices than smaller towns and rural areas. Additionally, the type of restaurant or eatery can also impact the cost, with traditional Bulgarian restaurants and street food stalls tend to be cheaper than international cuisine or fine dining establishments. Overall, Bulgaria offers a great combination of affordable food prices and a rich culinary culture, making it an excellent destination for foodies and travelers on a budget.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $0.80 | 1.40 BGN | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.60 | 1.05 BGN | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 2.10 BGN | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50 | 2.60 BGN | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 6.10 BGN | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 10.50 BGN | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $1.00 | 1.75 BGN | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.20 | 2.10 BGN | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.60 | 1.05 BGN | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 1.05 BGN | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 7.00 BGN | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.80 | 1.40 BGN | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like banitsa, shopska salad) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | (3 courses, wine or beer) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $1.50-$2.50 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $2.50-$3.50 | |\n| Cappuccino | $1.50-$2.50 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1.00-$2.00 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to buying groceries, Bulgaria offers a mix of supermarkets and open-air markets. Supermarkets like Lidl, Kaufland, and Billa offer a wide range of products, including international brands, at relatively low prices. However, local markets, known as \"pazari,\" offer fresh produce, meats, and dairy products at even lower prices. The price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with local markets often offering better value for money. For example, a kilogram of apples might cost $1.00 USD at a supermarket, but only $0.60 USD at a local market.\n\nIn general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, meats, and dairy products at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods, international brands, and convenience items. Bargaining is not common in supermarkets, but it's expected at local markets, especially for bulk purchases. When shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to learn some basic Bulgarian phrases, such as \"Kolko stoit?\" (how much does it cost?) and \"Molya, namali\" (please, lower the price). This can help you build a rapport with the vendors and get better prices.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries and street food stalls is an affordable and delicious way to experience Bulgarian cuisine, with meals starting from $3-$5 USD.\n- Traditional Bulgarian dishes like shopska salad, banitsa, and kebapche are not only tasty but also affordable, with prices ranging from $3-$5 USD.\n- Local staples like bread, cheese, and yogurt are great value for money, with prices starting from $0.60-$1.00 USD.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, as they tend to be more expensive than local products.\n- Consider shopping at local markets for fresh produce, meats, and dairy products to get better prices and support local vendors.\n- Don't be afraid to try new foods and drinks, like ayran (a yogurt-based drink) or boza (a fermented corn drink), which are not only delicious but also affordable, with prices starting from $0.50-$1.00 USD.",
