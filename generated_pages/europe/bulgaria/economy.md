[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Bulgaria has an upper-middle-income economy, with a mix of industrial, agricultural, and services sectors. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with a stable economic growth trajectory. Bulgaria's economy is driven by a combination of domestic consumption, investment, and exports. The country has a relatively low unemployment rate and a high level of human development. Bulgaria's economic classification is upper-middle-income, with a GDP per capita of around $9,700. The country's development level is characterized by a growing services sector, a declining agricultural sector, and a relatively stable industrial sector.

Bulgaria's economic trajectory has been influenced by its accession to the European Union in 2007, which has led to increased trade and investment with other EU countries.

However, Bulgaria still faces challenges related to corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and a lack of investment in key sectors such as education and innovation. The country's economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as changes in global trade patterns and fluctuations in commodity prices.

Despite these challenges, Bulgaria's economy has shown resilience and adaptability, with a growing number of startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) driving innovation and job creation. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East also makes it an attractive location for trade and investment.
