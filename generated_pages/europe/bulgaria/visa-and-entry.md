# Bulgaria Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Bulgaria before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Bulgaria has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa. The country is a member of the European Union and the Schengen Area, but it has not yet fully implemented the Schengen Acquis. As a result, Bulgaria has its own visa policy, which is separate from the Schengen visa policy. Currently, citizens of around 60 countries can enter Bulgaria visa-free, including most European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan.

The visa policy of Bulgaria is designed to facilitate travel and tourism, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. The government has implemented various measures to simplify the visa application process, including the introduction of an electronic visa system for certain nationalities. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and travelers should always check with the official embassy or consulate of Bulgaria for the most up-to-date information.
