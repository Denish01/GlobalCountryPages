[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Bulgaria's rental market is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available in cities like Sofia, Plovdiv, and Varna. Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the lease. Compared to its regional neighbors, Bulgaria's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists. However, the market can be competitive, especially in popular areas, so it's essential to act quickly when finding a suitable property.

The Bulgarian housing market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by a strong economy and a growing expat community. As a result, property prices have increased, but they remain relatively affordable compared to other European countries. The government has implemented measures to regulate the market and protect consumers, including laws governing rental agreements and property ownership. Despite these efforts, the market can still be challenging to navigate, especially for foreigners, so it's crucial to work with reputable real estate agents and lawyers to ensure a smooth transaction.
