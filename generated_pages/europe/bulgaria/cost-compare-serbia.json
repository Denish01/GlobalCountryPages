  "content": "Bulgaria is generally cheaper than Serbia, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nBulgaria GDP per Capita (PPP): $23,165\nSerbia GDP per Capita (PPP): $18,240\nBulgaria Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nSerbia Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Bulgaria\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Bulgaria vs Serbia [/SECTION]\nBulgaria and Serbia are two neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe that offer a unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, both countries are relatively affordable compared to other European nations. However, Bulgaria has a slight edge over Serbia, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower. This is largely due to the fact that Bulgaria has a more developed economy and a stronger currency, which has helped to keep prices in check. Additionally, Bulgaria has a more tourist-friendly infrastructure, which has led to a greater availability of affordable accommodations and services.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries is also worth considering. Bulgaria has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on services, industry, and agriculture. Serbia, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a greater reliance on industry and agriculture. This has led to a higher level of inflation in Serbia, which has contributed to the country's higher cost of living. Overall, Bulgaria is a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, while Serbia may be more suitable for those who are looking for a more off-the-beaten-path experience.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bulgaria (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $250 | $300 | 16.7% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $200 | 25% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $500 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bulgaria (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $10 | $12 | 16.7% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $200 | $250 | 20% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $2.50 | 20% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1.50 | $2 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bulgaria (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $25 | 20% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $0.60 | 16.7% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $0.90 | 11.1% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Bulgaria (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $100 | $120 | 16.7% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $25 | 20% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $12 | 16.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Bulgaria (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $600 | $750 | 20% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,250 | 20% |\n| Comfortable | $1,500 | $1,800 | 16.7% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Bulgaria is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices that are around 15-25% lower than in Serbia\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices that are around 16.7% lower than in Serbia\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares that are around 16.7% lower than in Serbia\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices that are around 16.7-20% lower than in Serbia\n- **Serbia is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain types of groceries, such as meat and dairy products\n  - Traditional handicrafts and souvenirs\n  - Outdoor activities, such as hiking and skiing\n  - Cultural events and festivals, which are often free or low-cost\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIn conclusion, Bulgaria is generally the more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, with a cost of living that is around 15-20% lower than in Serbia.
