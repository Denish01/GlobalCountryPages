[SECTION] Overview: Bulgaria vs Serbia [/SECTION]
Bulgaria and Serbia are two neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe that offer a unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, both countries are relatively affordable compared to other European nations. However, Bulgaria has a slight edge over Serbia, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower. This is largely due to the fact that Bulgaria has a more developed economy and a stronger currency, which has helped to keep prices in check. Additionally, Bulgaria has a more tourist-friendly infrastructure, which has led to a greater availability of affordable accommodations and services.

The economic context of the two countries is also worth considering. Bulgaria has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on services, industry, and agriculture. Serbia, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a greater reliance on industry and agriculture. This has led to a higher level of inflation in Serbia, which has contributed to the country's higher cost of living. Overall, Bulgaria is a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, while Serbia may be more suitable for those who are looking for a more off-the-beaten-path experience.
