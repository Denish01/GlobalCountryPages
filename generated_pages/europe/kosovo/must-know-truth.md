# The Truth About Kosovo - History & Real Facts

Kosovo is a complex and multifaceted country with a rich history, diverse culture, and a disputed status that is often misunderstood by the international community. 

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008, and has been recognized as a sovereign state by over 110 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and most European Union member states. The country has a long and varied history, with the first known human settlements dating back to the **Neolithic** period, around 6000 BC. The region was later inhabited by the **Illyrians**, a group of ancient tribes that lived in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula. In the 1st century AD, Kosovo was annexed by the **Roman Empire**, and later became part of the **Byzantine Empire**. In the 14th century, the region was conquered by the **Ottoman Empire**, which ruled Kosovo for nearly 500 years.

The **Ottoman Empire**'s rule had a significant impact on Kosovo's culture, language, and demographics, with many **Albanians** and **Serbs** living in the region. The **Albanian National Awakening** in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to a growing desire for independence among Albanians in Kosovo. After World War I, Kosovo became part of the **Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes**, which later became **Yugoslavia**. During World War II, Kosovo was occupied by **Italian** and **German** forces, and many Albanians and Serbs fought against the occupiers. After the war, Kosovo became an **autonomous province** within Yugoslavia, with a significant degree of self-governance.

In the 1990s, tensions between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo increased, leading to a violent conflict that resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. The **Kosovo War** ended with the intervention of **NATO** in 1999, and the establishment of a **United Nations** administration in the province. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence, which was met with opposition from Serbia and some other countries. Today, Kosovo is a **disputed territory**, with its status still unresolved.

The country's history has been marked by periods of conflict and tension, but also by periods of cultural and economic growth. The **Ottoman Empire**'s legacy can still be seen in Kosovo's architecture, cuisine, and traditions, while the **Albanian National Awakening** continues to shape the country's identity and politics. Understanding Kosovo's complex history is essential to grasping the country's current situation and its aspirations for the future.
