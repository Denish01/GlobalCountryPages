  "content": "Foreigners can buy property in Kosovo, but there are certain restrictions and requirements that must be met, making the process slightly more complex than in other European countries. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nCan Foreigners Buy?: Yes\nAverage Price (Capital, per sqm): $800 USD\nRental Yield: 5-7%\nProperty Tax: 0.1-0.2%\nPopular Areas: Pristina, Prizren, Gjakova\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]\nThe property market in Kosovo is still developing, with a mix of old and new buildings, especially in the capital city of Pristina. The current market conditions are characterized by a steady increase in demand, driven by a growing economy and a young population. Prices have been rising over the past few years, but they remain relatively low compared to other European countries. The urban areas, such as Pristina and Prizren, are more popular among investors and buyers, while the rural areas are mostly inhabited by locals. The price trajectory is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the country's EU integration aspirations and infrastructure development projects.\n\nThe market is also influenced by the country's complex history and political situation, which can affect the property market and the overall investment climate. However, the government has been working to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment, which is expected to have a positive impact on the property market. The urban-rural divide is also significant, with the urban areas offering more amenities and services, while the rural areas are often lacking in infrastructure and modern facilities.\n\nThe property market in Kosovo is also characterized by a lack of transparency and a relatively underdeveloped legal framework, which can make it challenging for foreigners to navigate. However, with the right guidance and support, it is possible to find good investment opportunities and navigate the complexities of the market. The government has been working to improve the situation, and there are efforts to establish a more transparent and efficient property registration system.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pristina | 800-1,200 | 200-400 | Apartment |\n| Prizren | 500-900 | 150-300 | Apartment |\n| Gjakova | 400-800 | 100-250 | Apartment |\n| Mitrovica | 300-600 | 80-200 | Apartment |\n| Peja | 400-700 | 100-250 | Apartment |\n| Ferizaj | 300-600 | 80-200 | House |\n| Gjilan | 250-500 | 60-150 | House |\n| Podujevo | 200-400 | 50-120 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Kosovo, but they must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning.\n- The permit is usually granted for a specific period, and it can be renewed.\n- Foreigners can also lease property for a maximum period of 99 years.\n- To buy property, foreigners must have a valid passport and a residence permit.\n- Foreign companies can also buy property in Kosovo, but they must be registered with the Kosovo Business Registration Agency.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
