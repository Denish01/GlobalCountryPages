[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Kosovo is easily accessible by air, with Pristina International Airport Adem Jashari (PRN) serving as the main gateway to the country. The airport is located about 15 kilometers southwest of Pristina and offers direct flights to several European cities, including Vienna, Zurich, and Istanbul. You can also enter Kosovo overland from its neighboring countries, including Serbia, North Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro. The main border crossings are well-marked and relatively easy to navigate, although be prepared for potential delays and strict security checks.

If you're planning to visit Kosovo from outside Europe, you may need to connect through a major hub such as Istanbul or Vienna. Several airlines, including Turkish Airlines, Austrian Airlines, and Swiss International Air Lines, offer flights to Pristina with layovers in their respective hubs. Additionally, budget airlines like Wizz Air and EasyJet operate flights to Pristina from various European cities, making it more affordable to travel to Kosovo. Be sure to check the latest entry requirements and visa regulations before your trip, as they may vary depending on your nationality.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Kosovo has a limited domestic air network, with no commercial airlines operating scheduled flights within the country. However, you can charter a private plane or helicopter for domestic flights, which can be a convenient option for travelers with limited time or those who want to explore Kosovo's remote areas. Keep in mind that chartering a private aircraft can be expensive, with prices starting from around $1,000 per hour.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Kosovo has no rail network, making it impossible to travel by train within the country or to neighboring countries. The lack of a rail network is due to the country's mountainous terrain and the fact that the existing rail infrastructure was largely destroyed during the Kosovo War in the late 1990s. As a result, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around Kosovo.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Kosovo has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect major cities and towns, including Pristina, Prizren, Gjakova, and Peja. Several private bus companies, such as FlixBus and Eurolines, operate daily services to and from Kosovo, with fares starting from around $10 for a one-way ticket. The bus network is relatively affordable and efficient, with modern vehicles and comfortable seating. You can purchase tickets online or at the bus station, and it's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.
