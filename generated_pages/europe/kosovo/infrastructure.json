  "content": "Kosovo's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 85%\nRoad Network: 6,955 km, with varying quality\nRail Network: 333 km\nMajor Airports: 1 international\nMajor Ports: landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nKosovo's infrastructure development level is still in progress, with a notable gap between urban and rural areas. The country has made significant strides in recent years, with investments in road construction, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, challenges persist, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services like electricity, water, and sanitation can be limited. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the construction of new roads, the expansion of energy generation capacities, and the improvement of water and sanitation systems.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is a significant challenge in Kosovo's infrastructure development. While cities like Pristina and Prizren have relatively modern infrastructure, rural areas often lack access to basic services. The government has launched initiatives to address this gap, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of energy and water services to rural areas. Additionally, international organizations and donors have provided significant funding to support infrastructure development in Kosovo.\n\nKosovo's infrastructure has also been impacted by its **disputed status**, which has limited the country's access to international funding and investment. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant progress in recent years, with a focus on developing the country's energy, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. The construction of new roads, the expansion of energy generation capacities, and the improvement of telecommunications services have all contributed to the country's growing economy and improving living standards.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 6,955 km | Moderate | Significant investments made in recent years to improve road quality |\n| Railways | 333 km | Poor | Limited rail network, with plans for expansion and modernization |\n| Airports | 1 international, 3 domestic | Good | International airport in Pristina, with connections to major European cities |\n| Ports | landlocked | N/A | No major ports, with trade relying on neighboring countries' ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Kosovo's energy sector is dominated by **lignite coal**, which accounts for the majority of the country's electricity generation.\n- The country has made significant progress in recent years to improve the reliability of its energy supply, with investments in new power plants and transmission infrastructure.\n- However, **energy efficiency** remains a challenge, with significant losses in the transmission and distribution systems.\n- Kosovo has set ambitious targets to increase the share of **renewable energy** in its energy mix, with a focus on solar and wind power.\n- The country has also made progress in reducing **power outages**, which were once a common occurrence, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in Kosovo, with many households relying on alternative sources of water due to concerns over water quality.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with **access to improved sanitation facilities** available to over 90% of the population.\n- However, **water access** remains a challenge in rural areas, where many households lack access to piped water and rely on wells or other alternative sources.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve water and sanitation services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the expansion of piped water networks.\n- International organizations have also provided significant funding to support the development of Kosovo's water and sanitation sector.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Kosovo, with all major operators offering 4G services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is also available in many areas, particularly in urban centers.\n- The rollout of **5G services** is expected to begin in the near future, with several operators already testing their networks.\n- **Postal services** are provided by the state-owned Post and Telecommunications of Kosovo (PTK), which offers a range of services including mail delivery and parcel shipping.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to improve **digital literacy** and increase access to telecommunications services, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The construction of a new **highway** connecting Pristina to the border with North Macedonia is currently underway, with funding provided by the European Union.\n- The government has also launched plans to **expand the rail network**, with a focus on improving connections to neighboring countries.\n- A new **energy transmission line** is being constructed to connect Kosovo to the European energy grid, which will improve the country's energy security and reduce its reliance on domestic generation.\n- The **Kosovo-Serbia rail link** is also being reconstructed, which will improve trade and transportation links between the two countries.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to **improve water and sanitation services**, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the expansion of piped water networks.",
