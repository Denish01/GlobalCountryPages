[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Kosovo has made significant progress in recent years in terms of safety and security, with a strong focus on rebuilding and development. The country has a low crime rate, and most visitors can expect a trouble-free experience. However, as with any country, there are areas that are considered safer than others, and visitors should take normal precautions to protect themselves and their belongings. The country's disputed status and complex history can sometimes lead to tensions, particularly in areas with mixed ethnic populations, but these are generally not targeted at tourists.

Visitors to Kosovo can expect a warm welcome from the local population, who are eager to share their culture and hospitality with visitors. The country has a growing tourism industry, and many locals are working to develop sustainable and responsible tourism practices. However, it's still important for visitors to be aware of their surroundings and take necessary precautions to stay safe. This includes being mindful of local customs and traditions, particularly in rural areas, and avoiding areas with high levels of political tension or demonstrations.
