The country's energy sector is dominated by coal-fired power plants, but there are also efforts to develop renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. The cost of utilities in Kosovo is generally stable, but can fluctuate depending on seasonal variations in demand. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the winter months when heating demand is greater.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Kosovo is generally good, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, there may be occasional disruptions to services, particularly during periods of high demand or maintenance. The cost of utilities is also influenced by the country's inflation rate, which is currently around 1.6%. This means that prices for utilities and other goods and services may increase over time, but at a relatively slow pace.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$135** | **$195** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-$25 | 30 Mbps | Kujtesa, IPKO |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-$50 | 100 Mbps | Kujtesa, IPKO |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-$10 | 5 GB | Vala, Z-Mobile |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-$20 | 10 GB | Vala, Z-Mobile |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-$50 | varies | Kujtesa, IPKO |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Kosovo, you will typically need to provide identification and proof of address to the relevant provider.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help you manage your energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Kosovo are Kujtesa and IPKO, which offer fast and reliable connections.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with your provider to get the best possible rates, especially if you are a long-term customer.",
