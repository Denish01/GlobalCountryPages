The economy is classified as upper-middle-income, with a growing services sector, a significant mining industry, and a smaller but still important agricultural sector.

However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a reliance on remittances from abroad. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the business environment, increasing foreign investment, and promoting economic growth.

Kosovo's economy is also driven by its strategic location in the Balkans, with access to major markets in Europe and a growing trade relationship with the European Union. The country has signed several trade agreements, including the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, which has helped to increase trade and investment flows.
