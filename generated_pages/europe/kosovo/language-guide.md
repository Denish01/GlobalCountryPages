[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Kosovo is complex, with two official languages, Albanian and Serbian, being spoken by the majority of the population. Albanian is the most widely spoken language, with around 92% of the population speaking it as their first language. Serbian is spoken by around 6% of the population, mainly in the northern parts of Kosovo. There are also several minority languages spoken in Kosovo, including Turkish, Bosnian, and Romani. Regional dialects of Albanian and Serbian are also spoken in different parts of the country. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population, and is widely understood in tourist areas and larger cities.

The use of language in Kosovo is often tied to ethnic identity, with Albanian being associated with the Albanian ethnic group and Serbian being associated with the Serbian ethnic group. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the use of English as a neutral language, particularly in business and education. Despite this, language remains a sensitive issue in Kosovo, and visitors should be aware of the linguistic and cultural nuances of the country.

In terms of language proficiency, Kosovo has a moderate level of English proficiency, with around 30% of the population able to speak some English. This is particularly true among the younger population and those in the service industry. However, it is still a good idea for visitors to learn some basic phrases in Albanian and Serbian, as this can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people.
