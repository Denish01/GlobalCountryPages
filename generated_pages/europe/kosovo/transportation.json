  "content": "To get around in Kosovo, you can use a combination of taxis, buses, and car rentals, as well as walk or bike in the capital city of Pristina and other urban areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Pristina International Airport Adem Jashari (PRN)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: Bolt, local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nKosovo is easily accessible by air, with Pristina International Airport Adem Jashari (PRN) serving as the main gateway to the country. The airport is located about 15 kilometers southwest of Pristina and offers direct flights to several European cities, including Vienna, Zurich, and Istanbul. You can also enter Kosovo overland from its neighboring countries, including Serbia, North Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro. The main border crossings are well-marked and relatively easy to navigate, although be prepared for potential delays and strict security checks.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Kosovo from outside Europe, you may need to connect through a major hub such as Istanbul or Vienna. Several airlines, including Turkish Airlines, Austrian Airlines, and Swiss International Air Lines, offer flights to Pristina with layovers in their respective hubs. Additionally, budget airlines like Wizz Air and EasyJet operate flights to Pristina from various European cities, making it more affordable to travel to Kosovo. Be sure to check the latest entry requirements and visa regulations before your trip, as they may vary depending on your nationality.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nKosovo has a limited domestic air network, with no commercial airlines operating scheduled flights within the country. However, you can charter a private plane or helicopter for domestic flights, which can be a convenient option for travelers with limited time or those who want to explore Kosovo's remote areas. Keep in mind that chartering a private aircraft can be expensive, with prices starting from around $1,000 per hour.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nKosovo has no rail network, making it impossible to travel by train within the country or to neighboring countries. The lack of a rail network is due to the country's mountainous terrain and the fact that the existing rail infrastructure was largely destroyed during the Kosovo War in the late 1990s. As a result, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around Kosovo.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nKosovo has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect major cities and towns, including Pristina, Prizren, Gjakova, and Peja. Several private bus companies, such as FlixBus and Eurolines, operate daily services to and from Kosovo, with fares starting from around $10 for a one-way ticket. The bus network is relatively affordable and efficient, with modern vehicles and comfortable seating. You can purchase tickets online or at the bus station, and it's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Pristina, Prizren, Gjakova | $0.50-$1.00 | Frequent services, affordable fares |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $2-$5 | Metered taxis, negotiate the fare before departure |\n| Ride-Hailing | Pristina, Prizren | $3-$6 | Bolt and local alternatives available |\n| Taxi | cities | $1-$3/km | Metered taxis, be aware of potential scams |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Kosovo, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as car insurance that covers you in Kosovo.\n- The road quality in Kosovo is moderate, with some paved roads and others that are unpaved or under construction.\n- Fuel costs in Kosovo are relatively affordable, with gasoline prices starting from around $1.20 per liter.\n- Car rental companies, such as Europcar and Sixt, operate in Pristina and other major cities, with prices starting from around $40 per day.\n- When driving in Kosovo, be aware of potential hazards such as potholes, livestock on the road, and aggressive drivers.\n- It's a good idea to rent a car with a GPS system or to hire a local driver who is familiar with the roads and traffic conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of potential scams when using taxis, such as drivers who refuse to use the meter or who take longer routes to increase the fare.\n- Always negotiate the fare before departing, and make sure to agree on the price.\n- Download the Bolt app or other local ride-hailing services to get around Pristina and other cities.\n- Carry small bills and coins, as not all vendors or taxi drivers may accept credit or debit cards.\n- Learn some basic Albanian phrases, such as \"hello\" (shpresa) and \"thank you\" (faleminderit), to help you navigate and interact with locals.\n- Be prepared for potential delays or disruptions to transportation services, especially during peak travel seasons or in areas with limited infrastructure.\n- Consider purchasing a local SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hotspot to stay connected and access maps and other travel resources.",
