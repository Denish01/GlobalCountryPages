# Kosovo Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Kosovo's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 85%
Road Network: 6,955 km, with varying quality
Rail Network: 333 km
Major Airports: 1 international
Major Ports: landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Kosovo's infrastructure development level is still in progress, with a notable gap between urban and rural areas. The country has made significant strides in recent years, with investments in road construction, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, challenges persist, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services like electricity, water, and sanitation can be limited. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including the construction of new roads, the expansion of energy generation capacities, and the improvement of water and sanitation systems.

The urban-rural divide is a significant challenge in Kosovo's infrastructure development. While cities like Pristina and Prizren have relatively modern infrastructure, rural areas often lack access to basic services. The government has launched initiatives to address this gap, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of energy and water services to rural areas. Additionally, international organizations and donors have provided significant funding to support infrastructure development in Kosovo.

Kosovo's infrastructure has also been impacted by its **disputed status**, which has limited the country's access to international funding and investment. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant progress in recent years, with a focus on developing the country's energy, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. The construction of new roads, the expansion of energy generation capacities, and the improvement of telecommunications services have all contributed to the country's growing economy and improving living standards.
