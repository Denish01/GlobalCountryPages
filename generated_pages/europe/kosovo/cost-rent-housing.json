Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, and tenants are usually required to pay a deposit of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Kosovar law, and renters can expect to have access to basic amenities such as electricity, water, and heating. Compared to its regional neighbors, Kosovo's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and foreigners looking to live in the Balkans.\n\nThe housing market in Kosovo is also influenced by the country's **economic growth**, with a GDP per capita of $17,864 and an inflation rate of 1.6%. This has led to an increase in demand for housing, particularly in the capital city, where many international organizations and businesses are based. However, the market is still relatively **underserved**, with a lack of high-quality housing options available, particularly in the suburbs and rural areas. As a result, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, quality, and amenities of the accommodation.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | typical quality, 40-60 sqm |\n| 2 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | family size, 60-80 sqm |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $350-$700 | spacious, 80-100 sqm |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$2,500 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,800 | residential areas, lower demand |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | limited amenities, lower prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Velania**: a quiet, residential neighborhood with a range of apartments and houses available, typical rent range $300-$600 per month\n- **Arbëria**: a popular neighborhood with many restaurants, bars, and shops, typical rent range $400-$800 per month\n- **Dardania**: a central neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, typical rent range $350-$700 per month\n- **Pejton**: a upscale neighborhood with modern apartments and houses, typical rent range $500-$1,000 per month\n- **Prizeren**: a historic neighborhood with a range of old and new buildings, typical rent range $300-$600 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Kosovo [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly before signing a lease, considering factors such as safety, amenities, and transportation links\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable apartment, and be sure to inspect the property carefully before signing a lease\n- Be prepared to negotiate the price, particularly if you are renting a long-term lease\n- Be aware of scams, such as fake rental listings or landlords who demand excessive deposits\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and heating are usually not included in the rent, so be sure to factor these costs into your budget\n- Most apartments are **unfurnished**, so be prepared to purchase or rent furniture and appliances if necessary",
