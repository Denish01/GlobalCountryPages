[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Kosovo's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but it has experienced significant growth trends in recent years. The population has been increasing at a rate of 0.8% per annum, driven by a combination of natural increase and migration. Urbanization is also a notable trend in Kosovo, with approximately 53% of the population living in urban areas. The capital city, Pristina, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 200,000 people. Migration patterns in Kosovo are complex, with many young people leaving the country in search of better economic opportunities, while others are returning to their homeland after living abroad.

The population of Kosovo is relatively young, with a median age of 29 years, which has significant implications for the country's economy and society. The young population is a driving force behind the country's economic growth, but it also poses challenges in terms of employment and education. The government has been working to address these challenges by investing in education and job creation programs. Despite these efforts, many young people in Kosovo still face significant challenges in terms of finding employment and accessing quality education.

The population density of Kosovo is approximately 145 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high compared to other European countries. This has put pressure on the country's infrastructure and natural resources, particularly in urban areas. The government has been working to address these challenges by investing in infrastructure development and promoting sustainable practices.
