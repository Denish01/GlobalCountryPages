  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Kosovo varies significantly between public and private facilities, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but often lacking in quality and resources, while private healthcare offers better quality but at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $844 (estimated, based on GDP per capita PPP: $17,864)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 40% of total healthcare expenditure (estimated)\nHealthcare System: Mixed (Public / Private)\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nKosovo's healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, private healthcare facilities in Kosovo offer better quality care, with more modern equipment and trained staff, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care.\n\nThe healthcare system in Kosovo is not fully universal, and many citizens rely on out-of-pocket payments or private insurance to access quality care. While some public healthcare services are free or low-cost, specialized care and advanced treatments often require significant payment. For foreigners, it is highly recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in Kosovo, as the public system may not provide adequate care for their needs. Many private insurance companies offer plans that cover medical expenses in Kosovo, and some even have partnerships with local private hospitals.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public clinics often have long waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may require additional testing |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dentists often have more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Public eye exams may not include advanced testing |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public ERs may be crowded and understaffed |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | Private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,500 | Private hospitals often have better neonatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public healthcare services, limited specialized care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private healthcare services, including specialized care and hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can be purchased at pharmacies with a doctor's prescription, and prices vary depending on the medication and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices starting from $5-$10.\n- Common medications like pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$20.\n- Pharmacy chains like B&S and Viva are popular and have multiple locations throughout Kosovo.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for certain medications or loyalty programs.\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration dates and packaging of medications before purchasing.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is best to call the emergency number 112, which is available 24/7. Ambulance services are available, but response times may vary depending on the location. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contacts, including the embassy and private insurance provider. The University Clinical Center of Kosovo in Pristina is one of the best public hospitals in the country, but it may still lack the resources and specialized care that foreigners are used to. Private hospitals like the Medika Hospital in Pristina offer better quality care and are often preferred by foreigners.\n\nFor emergency care, it is essential to have a means of payment or insurance that covers medical expenses. Some private hospitals may require upfront payment or a guarantee of payment before providing care. In case of a serious medical emergency, medical evacuation to a neighboring country or Europe may be necessary, and having international health insurance that covers evacuation costs is crucial. It is also recommended to research local hospitals and emergency services before traveling to Kosovo and to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency.",
