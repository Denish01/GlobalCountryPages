[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Kosovo's utility infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on increasing efficiency and reducing costs. The country's energy sector is dominated by coal-fired power plants, but there are also efforts to develop renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. The cost of utilities in Kosovo is generally stable, but can fluctuate depending on seasonal variations in demand. For example, electricity costs may be higher during the winter months when heating demand is greater.

The quality of utility services in Kosovo is generally good, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, there may be occasional disruptions to services, particularly during periods of high demand or maintenance. The cost of utilities is also influenced by the country's inflation rate, which is currently around 1.6%. This means that prices for utilities and other goods and services may increase over time, but at a relatively slow pace.
