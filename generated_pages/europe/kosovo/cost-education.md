[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Kosovo is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest and most accessible. The language of instruction in public schools is primarily Albanian, while some schools also offer instruction in Serbian. The quality of public education in Kosovo can vary, with some schools facing challenges such as outdated infrastructure and limited resources. In contrast, private schools in Kosovo tend to have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but can be expensive and out of reach for many families. Compulsory education in Kosovo lasts for 9 years, from age 6 to 15, and is divided into primary and secondary education.

International schools are also available in Kosovo, particularly in the capital city of Pristina, and offer a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the British GCSE and A-level programs. These schools cater primarily to the children of expatriates and diplomats, as well as to Kosovar families who can afford the high tuition fees. The quality of education in international schools in Kosovo is generally high, with many schools having experienced teachers and modern facilities. However, the cost of attending an international school in Kosovo can be prohibitively expensive for many families.
