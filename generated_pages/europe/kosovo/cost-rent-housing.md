[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Kosovo's rental market is relatively affordable compared to other European countries, with a wide range of options available in the capital city of Pristina and other urban areas. Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, and tenants are usually required to pay a deposit of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Kosovar law, and renters can expect to have access to basic amenities such as electricity, water, and heating. Compared to its regional neighbors, Kosovo's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and foreigners looking to live in the Balkans.

The housing market in Kosovo is also influenced by the country's **economic growth**, with a GDP per capita of $17,864 and an inflation rate of 1.6%. This has led to an increase in demand for housing, particularly in the capital city, where many international organizations and businesses are based. However, the market is still relatively **underserved**, with a lack of high-quality housing options available, particularly in the suburbs and rural areas. As a result, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, quality, and amenities of the accommodation.
