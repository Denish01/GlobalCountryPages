The country's small size and high standard of living have enabled it to develop a comprehensive and well-maintained infrastructure network.

The government of Liechtenstein has been actively investing in infrastructure development, with a focus on improving the country's competitiveness and attractiveness to businesses and residents. This includes investments in renewable energy, expansion of the public transport network, and upgrades to the country's telecommunications infrastructure. Despite these efforts, the country still faces challenges in terms of its landlocked location and limited natural resources, which can make it difficult to develop certain types of infrastructure, such as ports and airports.

Overall, Liechtenstein's infrastructure is well-developed and reliable, with a strong focus on maintaining high standards and investing in new technologies and services. This has enabled the country to maintain a high standard of living and to attract businesses and residents from around the world.
