Liechtenstein is a sovereign state located in Central Europe, bordered by Austria and Switzerland. The country is divided into 11 communes, which are the primary administrative divisions. These communes are responsible for providing local services, such as education, transportation, and social welfare, to their residents. The communes are further grouped into two regions: the Oberland (Upper Land) and the Unterland (Lower Land). The Oberland region includes the communes of Vaduz, Schaan, Planken, and Triesenberg, while the Unterland region includes the communes of Ruggell, Schellenberg, Gamprin, Eschen, Mauren, and Balzers.
