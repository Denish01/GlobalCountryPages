# The Truth About Liechtenstein - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Liechtenstein is a sovereign state located in Central Europe, bordered by Austria to the east and Switzerland to the west. The country has a unique history, with its founding dating back to 1719, when it was created as a **principality** by the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI. The principality was formed through the union of the territories of Vaduz and Schellenberg, which were purchased by the Princes of Liechtenstein from the Hohenems family. The Princes of Liechtenstein were a noble family from Lower Austria, who had risen to prominence in the 17th century.

The country's early history was marked by its strategic location, with the Rhine River forming its western border. This location made Liechtenstein an important hub for trade and commerce, with the country's rulers seeking to maintain their independence and neutrality in the face of powerful neighboring states. In 1806, Liechtenstein became a member of the **Confederation of the Rhine**, a league of German states formed by Napoleon. Following Napoleon's defeat, Liechtenstein joined the **German Confederation**, a loose association of German states that existed from 1815 to 1866.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liechtenstein underwent significant economic and social changes, with the country industrializing and urbanizing rapidly. The country's **constitution**, adopted in 1921, established Liechtenstein as a constitutional monarchy, with the Prince serving as head of state and a parliament elected by the people. During World War II, Liechtenstein maintained its neutrality, although the country's government was forced to make concessions to Nazi Germany.

Today, Liechtenstein is a modern, prosperous state, with a high standard of living and a strong economy. The country is a member of the **European Free Trade Association (EFTA)** and the **Council of Europe**, and has close ties with neighboring Switzerland and Austria. Liechtenstein's unique history and strategic location have shaped the country's development and identity, with the country seeking to balance its independence and sovereignty with its integration into the wider European community.
