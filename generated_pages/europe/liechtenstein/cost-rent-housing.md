[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Liechtenstein is highly competitive, with a limited supply of apartments and houses available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 1 to 3 years, with a 2-3 month deposit required. Tenant rights are well-protected in Liechtenstein, with the **Renters' Protection Act** providing a framework for fair treatment and rent increases. Compared to regional neighbors Austria and Switzerland, Liechtenstein's housing costs are relatively high, particularly in the city center. However, the country's low unemployment rate, high standard of living, and stunning natural beauty make it an attractive destination for expats and locals alike.

The housing market in Liechtenstein is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional buildings, with a strong emphasis on quality and design. Many apartments and houses are equipped with **state-of-the-art amenities**, including high-speed internet, cable TV, and modern kitchen appliances. However, the market can be challenging for renters, particularly those on a budget. With a limited supply of affordable housing, renters may need to act quickly to secure a suitable property. Additionally, the market is subject to fluctuations in the global economy, which can impact housing prices and availability.
