The country's strong economy, low unemployment, and high standard of living make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists alike. However, this also means that the cost of living in Liechtenstein is relatively high compared to other European countries. For example, a one-bedroom apartment in the capital city of Vaduz can cost around $2,000 to $3,000 per month, while a meal at a mid-range restaurant can cost around $25 to $35 per person. Overall, Liechtenstein is a great destination for those who value a high standard of living and are willing to pay for it.\n\nIn comparison to its neighboring countries, Austria and Switzerland, Liechtenstein has a similar cost of living. However, the country's small size and limited job market mean that salaries are often lower than in larger cities in Austria and Switzerland.

On the other hand, the country's low taxes and business-friendly environment make it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs and businesses.
