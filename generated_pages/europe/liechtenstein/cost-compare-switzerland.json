However, there are some differences between the two countries that can affect the cost of living for expats, students, and tourists. Liechtenstein has a slightly higher cost of living than Switzerland, mainly due to its smaller size and limited economy, which can lead to higher prices for certain goods and services. On the other hand, Switzerland has a more developed economy and a larger market, which can lead to lower prices for certain items.\n\nThe economic context of both countries is also an important factor to consider. Liechtenstein has a highly developed financial sector and a strong industry, which can lead to higher salaries and a higher cost of living. Switzerland, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, banking, and pharmaceuticals. This diversity can lead to a more stable economy and a lower cost of living.
