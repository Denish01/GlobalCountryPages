[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Liechtenstein is relatively small, with a total of approximately 40,900 people, according to the latest estimates. The country has a relatively slow population growth rate of 0.8%, which is largely due to a low fertility rate and a high life expectancy. The population is predominantly urban, with around 64% of the population living in urban areas, such as the capital city Vaduz. Liechtenstein has a high population density, with an average of 256 people per square kilometer, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to a combination of natural increase and migration.

The population of Liechtenstein is also characterized by a high level of urbanization, with many people living in the capital city Vaduz and other urban areas. The country has a well-developed infrastructure, with good transportation links and a high standard of living, which makes it an attractive destination for migrants. However, the country's small size and limited job market mean that the population is not expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Despite this, Liechtenstein remains a popular destination for tourists and business travelers, with its stunning natural beauty and unique cultural heritage.

The population of Liechtenstein is also aging, with a median age of 42.4 years, which is one of the highest in the world. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social security system, as a large proportion of the population is approaching retirement age. To address this challenge, the government has implemented a range of policies aimed at encouraging immigration and increasing the fertility rate, including measures to support families and young people.
