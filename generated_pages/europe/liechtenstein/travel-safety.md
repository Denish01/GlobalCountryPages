[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Liechtenstein is considered one of the safest countries in the world, with low crime rates and a strong emphasis on law and order. The country's small size, stable government, and high standard of living all contribute to its excellent safety record. Visitors can feel comfortable walking around the capital city Vaduz and other towns, even at night, with little risk of encountering crime or harassment. The police are efficient and responsive, and there are no areas that are considered particularly dangerous for tourists.

However, as with any country, it's still important to take common-sense precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Pickpocketing and petty theft can occur in crowded areas or tourist hotspots, so it's a good idea to keep a close eye on your belongings and be mindful of your surroundings. Additionally, Liechtenstein's rugged terrain and mountainous landscape can pose hazards for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, so it's essential to be prepared and take necessary safety precautions when exploring the countryside.
