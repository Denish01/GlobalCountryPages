[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Liechtenstein is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 10, is provided by the government and is free of charge. Secondary education, which lasts for 6 years, is also compulsory and is divided into two main types: **Realschule** and **Gymnasium**. The **Realschule** is a more practical and vocational-oriented school, while the **Gymnasium** is a more academically-oriented school that prepares students for university. Tertiary education is provided by the University of Liechtenstein, which offers a range of undergraduate and graduate programs in fields such as business, engineering, and law.

The quality of education in Liechtenstein is very high, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and practical skills. The country has a highly developed education system, with a high level of investment in education and a strong focus on teacher training and development. The education system is also highly decentralized, with a significant amount of autonomy given to individual schools and teachers. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and innovation in the education system, which is seen as a major strength.

In terms of public versus private education, the majority of schools in Liechtenstein are public, with only a small number of private schools. However, the private schools in Liechtenstein are highly regarded and offer a range of academic programs and extracurricular activities. The tuition fees for private schools in Liechtenstein are generally high, but the quality of education provided is seen as being well worth the cost.
