[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Liechtenstein has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa. As a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the Schengen Area, Liechtenstein's visa policy is closely aligned with that of Switzerland. Citizens of over 60 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, can enter Liechtenstein without a visa for a specific period, typically up to 90 days within a 180-day period. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Liechtenstein for the most up-to-date information.

Liechtenstein's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and tourism while maintaining national security and immigration control. The country's unique location, nestled between Switzerland and Austria, makes it an attractive destination for travelers exploring the European continent. With its stunning Alpine landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and vibrant economy, Liechtenstein is a popular destination for tourists, business travelers, and students alike.
