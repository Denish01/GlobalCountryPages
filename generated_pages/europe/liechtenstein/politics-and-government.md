[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The political system of Liechtenstein is based on the principle of **separation of powers**, where the legislative, executive, and judicial branches are separate and independent. The **Landtag**, a unicameral parliament, is composed of 25 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **monarch** serves as the head of state, while the **prime minister** is the head of government, responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration. The government is accountable to the Landtag, which has the power to pass laws, approve the budget, and exercise parliamentary control.

The political system is characterized by a high degree of **stability** and **consensus**, with a strong emphasis on **direct democracy**. Citizens have the right to initiate **referendums** and **popular initiatives**, which allows them to participate directly in the decision-making process. This unique system has contributed to Liechtenstein's reputation as a **stable and secure** country.

The **federal structure** of Liechtenstein is relatively simple, with two main administrative divisions: the **municipalities** and the **national government**. The municipalities have a significant degree of autonomy, with responsibility for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The national government, on the other hand, is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, defense, and economic policy.
