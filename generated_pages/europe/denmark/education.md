[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Denmark is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, known as **folkeskole**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 16 and lasts for 10 years. This is followed by secondary education, which can be either vocational or academic, and prepares students for tertiary education. The quality of education in Denmark is generally high, with a strong emphasis on **critical thinking**, **problem-solving**, and **collaboration**. The majority of schools in Denmark are public, but there are also private schools, known as **friskoler**, which offer an alternative to the public system.

The Danish education system is known for its **flexibility** and **autonomy**, with a focus on student-centered learning and a strong emphasis on **social responsibility**. Students are encouraged to take an active role in their learning, and teachers are expected to facilitate and guide rather than simply lecture. This approach has contributed to Denmark's high ranking in international education surveys, such as the **Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)**.

In addition to its strong public education system, Denmark also has a well-developed **adult education** system, which provides opportunities for adults to continue their education and training throughout their lives. This includes **vocational training**, **language courses**, and **academic programs**, which are designed to meet the needs of the labor market and support **lifelong learning**.
