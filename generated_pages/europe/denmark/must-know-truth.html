        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Denmark's history dates back to the <strong>Viking Age</strong>, which began in the late 8th century and lasted until the mid-11th century. During this period, Denmark was a major power in Europe, with the Vikings raiding and trading throughout the continent. In 965, Denmark was unified under a single ruler, <strong>Harald Bluetooth</strong>, who introduced Christianity to the country. In the 12th century, Denmark became a feudal state, with the monarch holding absolute power.</p>
        <p>In the 14th century, Denmark formed a union with Norway and Sweden, known as the <strong>Kalmar Union</strong>, which lasted until 1523. During this period, Denmark's economy and culture flourished, with the country becoming a major trading power in the Baltic region. In 1660, Denmark became an <strong>absolute monarchy</strong>, with the monarch holding complete control over the government and the economy. This period lasted until 1848, when a constitutional monarchy was established.</p>
        <p>Denmark's modern history began in the 19th century, with the country experiencing a period of rapid industrialization and economic growth. In 1849, Denmark adopted a <strong>constitution</strong>, which established the country as a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. During World War II, Denmark was occupied by Germany, but the country maintained its sovereignty and was able to maintain a degree of autonomy.</p>
        <p>In the second half of the 20th century, Denmark experienced a period of rapid economic growth, driven by the country's <strong>welfare state</strong> and its highly developed social safety net. Today, Denmark is a <strong>sovereign state</strong>, with a population of 5.9 million people and a highly developed economy. The country is a member of the <strong>European Union</strong> and the <strong>NATO</strong> alliance, and plays an active role in international affairs.</p>
