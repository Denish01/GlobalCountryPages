  "content": "Denmark is generally cheaper than Norway, with an overall cost of living difference of around 10-20%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nDenmark GDP per Capita (PPP): 52,610\nNorway GDP per Capita (PPP): 70,591\nDenmark Inflation Rate: 0.8%\nNorway Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Denmark\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Denmark vs Norway [/SECTION]\nDenmark and Norway are two neighboring countries in Europe, known for their high standard of living and stunning natural beauty. However, they differ significantly in terms of cost of living. Denmark is generally considered to be more affordable than Norway, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. According to the OECD, Denmark's GDP per capita is lower than Norway's, which contributes to the difference in cost of living. Additionally, Denmark's inflation rate is lower than Norway's, which means that prices are rising more slowly in Denmark.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in the cost of living difference. Norway's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which has driven up the cost of living in the country. In contrast, Denmark's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on services and manufacturing. As a result, Denmark is generally considered to be a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees. However, it's worth noting that both countries offer a high standard of living and excellent quality of life, so the difference in cost of living is not the only factor to consider when deciding which country to choose.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Denmark (USD) | Norway (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 1,800 | 50% more expensive in Norway |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 900 | 1,200 | 33% more expensive in Norway |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 2,500 | 3,500 | 40% more expensive in Norway |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Denmark (USD) | Norway (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 20 | 25 | 25% more expensive in Norway |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 600 | 20% more expensive in Norway |\n| Beer (500ml) | 6 | 8 | 33% more expensive in Norway |\n| Coffee | 4 | 5 | 25% more expensive in Norway |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Denmark (USD) | Norway (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 90 | 120 | 33% more expensive in Norway |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 3 | 50% more expensive in Norway |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.50 | 1.80 | 20% more expensive in Norway |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Denmark (USD) | Norway (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 200 | 33% more expensive in Norway |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 33% more expensive in Norway |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 30 | 50% more expensive in Norway |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Denmark (USD) | Norway (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 2,000 | 25% savings in Denmark |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 3,500 | 29% savings in Denmark |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 5,500 | 27% savings in Denmark |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Denmark is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 50% lower than in Norway\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries up to 25% cheaper\n- Transportation, with monthly transit passes and fuel up to 33% cheaper\n- Utilities and internet, with bills up to 33% lower\n- **Norway is cheaper for:**\n- Certain types of consumer goods, such as electronics and clothing, which can be up to 10% cheaper\n- Outdoor activities, such as hiking and skiing, which are often free or low-cost in Norway's natural beauty spots\n- Healthcare, with Norway's public healthcare system considered to be one of the best in the world\n- Education, with Norway's public universities offering free tuition to international students\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to cost of living, Denmark is generally the more affordable option.
