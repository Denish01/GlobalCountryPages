[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Denmark has a **worldwide taxation** system, which means that residents are taxed on their global income, regardless of where it is earned. To be considered a tax resident in Denmark, an individual must have a permanent home in the country or have stayed in Denmark for more than 183 days in a calendar year. Non-residents, on the other hand, are only taxed on their Danish-sourced income. The tax system in Denmark is designed to be fair and equitable, with a range of tax rates and rules that apply to different types of income and taxpayers.

The Danish tax system is also known for its **progressive tax rates**, which means that higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate than lower income earners. This approach is designed to reduce income inequality and ensure that everyone contributes their fair share to the tax system. In addition to income tax, Denmark also has a range of other taxes, including **value-added tax (VAT)**, **corporate tax**, and **capital gains tax**. These taxes are designed to raise revenue for the government and fund public services and infrastructure.
