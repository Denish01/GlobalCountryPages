[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Denmark's linguistic landscape is dominated by Danish, which is the official language and the mother tongue of the vast majority of the population. However, there are several regional dialects, including Jutlandic, Funen Danish, and Zealand Danish, each with its own unique characteristics and pronunciation. Additionally, there are several minority languages spoken in Denmark, including German, which is spoken by the German minority in southern Jutland, and Romani, which is spoken by the Romani people. English is widely understood and spoken in Denmark, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry, making it easy for tourists to communicate and navigate the country.

Denmark's high level of English proficiency is due in part to the country's strong education system, which places a heavy emphasis on language learning. As a result, many Danes are fluent in multiple languages, including English, German, and Swedish. This has made Denmark an attractive destination for international businesses and tourists alike. Despite the widespread use of English, it's still a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in Danish, which can go a long way in showing respect for the culture and people.

The use of English in Denmark is not limited to the service industry, but is also widely used in business, education, and government. Many Danish companies do business in English, and it's not uncommon for meetings and conferences to be conducted entirely in English. This has made it easier for international companies to operate in Denmark and for Danish companies to expand globally. Overall, Denmark's linguistic landscape is characterized by a high level of linguistic diversity and a strong emphasis on language learning.
