To be considered a tax resident in Denmark, an individual must have a permanent home in the country or have stayed in Denmark for more than 183 days in a calendar year. Non-residents, on the other hand, are only taxed on their Danish-sourced income. The tax system in Denmark is designed to be fair and equitable, with a range of tax rates and rules that apply to different types of income and taxpayers.\n\nThe Danish tax system is also known for its **progressive tax rates**, which means that higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate than lower income earners. This approach is designed to reduce income inequality and ensure that everyone contributes their fair share to the tax system. In addition to income tax, Denmark also has a range of other taxes, including **value-added tax (VAT)**, **corporate tax**, and **capital gains tax**. These taxes are designed to raise revenue for the government and fund public services and infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Personal Income Tax [/SECTION]\n| Income Bracket (DKK) | Tax Rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 - 459,200 | 36.9% |\n| 459,201 - 513,400 | 40.7% |\n| 513,401 - 459,200 (above this amount 42% is added to the 36.9%) | 42% + 36.9% = 48.08% (average) |\n| 459,200 (above this amount 55.9% is added to the 36.9% - 8.08% of the amount above) | 55.9% - 8.08% = 46.02% (marginal) + 8.08% (average) |\n| above 459,200 (above this amount 55.9% is added to the 36.9%) | 55.9% |\nTaxpayers in Denmark are entitled to a range of **deductions and allowances**, including deductions for mortgage interest, charitable donations, and education expenses.
