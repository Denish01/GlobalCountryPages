The **Constitution of Denmark**, adopted in 1849, establishes the framework for the country's government and guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms to its citizens. The **separation of powers** is a key feature of Denmark's political system, with the **legislative**, **executive**, and **judicial** branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. Denmark is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and no federal or regional entities with significant autonomy.\n\nThe **Folketing**, Denmark's unicameral legislature, is composed of 179 members elected by **proportional representation** for four-year terms. The **prime minister**, who is the head of government, is typically the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the Folketing. The **monarch** serves as the head of state, but their role is largely ceremonial and symbolic. Denmark's political system is characterized by a high degree of **consensus** and **cooperation** among parties, with a strong emphasis on **social welfare** and **public services**.\n\nThe Danish political system is also known for its **decentralization** and **local autonomy**, with significant powers devolved to **municipalities** and **regions**. This allows for a high degree of **participation** and **involvement** by citizens in local decision-making processes. Denmark's **electoral system** is based on **proportional representation**, which ensures that smaller parties have a voice in the Folketing and can participate in coalition governments.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the Prime Minister | Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen | Head of government, responsible for overall policy direction |\n| Legislative | The Folketing | Speaker Søren Gade | Unicameral legislature, responsible for law-making and oversight of government |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Denmark | President of the Supreme Court | Highest court in Denmark, responsible for interpreting the constitution and laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Social Democratic Party | Center-left | Mette Frederiksen | 48 | Largest party in the Folketing, leader of the current government |\n| Liberal Party | Center-right | Jakob Ellemann-Jensen | 43 | Second-largest party in the Folketing, main opposition party |\n| Danish People's Party | Right-wing | Morten Messerschmidt | 16 | Nationalist party with a strong focus on immigration and law and order |\n| Red-Green Alliance | Left-wing | Pernille Skipper | 13 | Socialist party with a strong focus on social welfare and environmental issues |\n| Conservative People's Party | Center-right | Søren Pape Poulsen | 12 | Traditional conservative party with a strong focus on business and economic issues |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- Denmark's electoral system is based on **proportional representation**, with voters casting ballots for parties rather than individual candidates.\n- Elections to the Folketing are held every four years, unless a government loses a vote of confidence or the prime minister calls an early election.\n- The last election was held in 2022, with the Social Democratic Party emerging as the largest party and forming a coalition government with other center-left parties.\n- Voter participation in Danish elections is generally high, with around 80-90% of eligible voters casting ballots.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Denmark is considered a **politically stable** country, with a strong tradition of democratic governance and low levels of corruption.\n- The country faces **challenges** related to **immigration** and **integration**, with debates over issues such as border control and social welfare benefits for migrants.\n- Denmark is also **concerned** about **climate change** and its impact on the country's economy and environment, with a strong focus on **renewable energy** and **sustainable development**.\n- The country has a high degree of **social cohesion**, with a strong emphasis on **social welfare** and **public services**, but faces challenges related to **inequality** and **social exclusion**.\n- Denmark is ranked highly in terms of **human rights** and **freedom of speech**, with a strong tradition of protecting individual liberties and promoting **democratic values**.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Denmark is a **member** of the **European Union** (EU) and the **North Atlantic Treaty Organization** (NATO), and plays an active role in **international affairs**.\n- The country has a **strong relationship** with its **Nordic neighbors**, including Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and participates in regional organizations such as the **Nordic Council**.\n- Denmark is also a **member** of the **United Nations** (UN) and other **international organizations**, and is committed to **promoting peace** and **stability** around the world.\n- The country has a **diplomatic stance** that emphasizes **multilateralism** and **cooperation**, with a focus on issues such as **climate change**, **sustainable development**, and **human rights**.\n- Denmark has a **key alliance** with the **United States**, with cooperation on issues such as **defense** and **security**, as well as **trade** and **investment**.",
