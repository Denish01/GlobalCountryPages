[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Denmark's **universal healthcare system** provides comprehensive coverage to all residents, including foreigners who are registered with the Danish authorities. The system is primarily funded through taxes, with some out-of-pocket expenses for certain services. Public healthcare institutions, known as sygehuse, provide high-quality medical care, while private hospitals and clinics, known as speciallægehospitalet, offer more specialized and personalized care. For locals, the healthcare system is generally easy to navigate, with most medical services covered by the public system. However, foreigners may need to purchase private health insurance to cover their medical expenses, especially if they are not registered with the Danish authorities.

In Denmark, medical care is generally of high quality, with well-trained doctors and modern medical facilities. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between public and private institutions. Public hospitals and clinics are generally well-equipped and staffed by experienced medical professionals, while private hospitals and clinics may offer more luxurious amenities and personalized care. To access the healthcare system, residents and foreigners alike can register with a general practitioner, known as a læge, who will provide primary care and refer patients to specialists as needed. Foreigners who are not registered with the Danish authorities may need to pay out-of-pocket for medical services or purchase private health insurance to cover their expenses.
