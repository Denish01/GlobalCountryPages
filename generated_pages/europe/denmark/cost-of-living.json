[/SECTION]\nDenmark is considered one of the most expensive countries in the world. Compared to its European neighbors, Denmark has a significantly higher cost of living. The country's high taxes, combined with a strong economy and high standard of living, contribute to the elevated prices of goods and services. Visitors and expats can expect to pay premium prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. However, the high cost of living is offset by the country's excellent social services, low crime rate, and high standard of living.\n\nIn comparison to other European countries, Denmark is more expensive than Germany and Sweden, but on par with Norway. The high cost of living in Denmark is particularly noticeable in the capital city of Copenhagen, where prices are significantly higher than in other parts of the country. Despite the high costs, Denmark remains a popular destination for tourists and expats, who are drawn to the country's vibrant culture, stunning landscapes, and high standard of living.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-60 | Basic rooms with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $150-250 | 3-star hotels with private facilities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $300-500 | 5-star hotels with high-end amenities |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $1,200-2,500 | City center: $1,800-3,000, outside city center: $1,000-2,000 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-15 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $60-100 |\n| Fine Dining | $150-250 |\n| Beer (local) | $6-8 |\n| Coffee | $4-6 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $3-5 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-3 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.00 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 1,000 | 1,800 | 3,000 |\n| Food | 600 | 1,000 | 1,500 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 150 | 250 | 350 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **2,050** | **3,650** | **5,750** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in budget-friendly accommodation options, such as hostels or Airbnb apartments, to save on housing costs.\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls, which offer affordable and delicious meals.\n- Buy groceries at discount supermarkets, such as Netto or Lidl, to save on food costs.\n- Use public transportation, which is efficient and affordable, instead of taxis or rental cars.\n- Take advantage of free museums and cultural events, which are often offered on certain days of the week or month.\n- Consider purchasing a **Copenhagen Card**, which grants access to public transportation and discounts on attractions and restaurants.",
