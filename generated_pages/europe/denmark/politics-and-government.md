[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Denmark's political system is based on the principles of **democracy**, **representative government**, and **rule of law**. The **Constitution of Denmark**, adopted in 1849, establishes the framework for the country's government and guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms to its citizens. The **separation of powers** is a key feature of Denmark's political system, with the **legislative**, **executive**, and **judicial** branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. Denmark is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and no federal or regional entities with significant autonomy.

The **Folketing**, Denmark's unicameral legislature, is composed of 179 members elected by **proportional representation** for four-year terms. The **prime minister**, who is the head of government, is typically the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the Folketing. The **monarch** serves as the head of state, but their role is largely ceremonial and symbolic. Denmark's political system is characterized by a high degree of **consensus** and **cooperation** among parties, with a strong emphasis on **social welfare** and **public services**.

The Danish political system is also known for its **decentralization** and **local autonomy**, with significant powers devolved to **municipalities** and **regions**. This allows for a high degree of **participation** and **involvement** by citizens in local decision-making processes. Denmark's **electoral system** is based on **proportional representation**, which ensures that smaller parties have a voice in the Folketing and can participate in coalition governments.
