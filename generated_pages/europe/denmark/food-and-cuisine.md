[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Denmark's cuisine is defined by its emphasis on local, seasonal ingredients and simple, hearty dishes. The country's location on the Baltic Sea has made it a hub for seafood, with popular dishes like pickled herring and fried fish. Danish cuisine has also been influenced by its neighboring countries, particularly Germany and Sweden, with many traditional dishes featuring pork, beef, and lamb. Regional variations are also present, with the island of Bornholm known for its unique specialties like sun-dried fish and Sol over Gudhjem, a dish made with smoked herring, eggs, and chives.

Danish cuisine is often associated with the concept of **hygge**, which refers to a feeling of coziness and warmth. This is reflected in the country's love of comfort foods like stews, soups, and baked goods. Denmark is also famous for its pastries, with popular treats like kanelsnurrer (a cinnamon swirl) and wienerbrød (a Danish pastry). In recent years, Danish cuisine has experienced a resurgence in popularity, with many restaurants focusing on modern, innovative takes on traditional dishes.

The Danish capital, Copenhagen, is a hub for foodies, with many world-class restaurants and a vibrant food scene. The city is home to some of the world's best restaurants, including Noma, which has been named the best restaurant in the world several times. Copenhagen is also known for its street food scene, with many markets and food stalls offering a range of traditional and modern dishes.
