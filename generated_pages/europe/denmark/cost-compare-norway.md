[SECTION] Overview: Denmark vs Norway [/SECTION]
Denmark and Norway are two neighboring countries in Europe, known for their high standard of living and stunning natural beauty. However, they differ significantly in terms of cost of living. Denmark is generally considered to be more affordable than Norway, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. According to the OECD, Denmark's GDP per capita is lower than Norway's, which contributes to the difference in cost of living. Additionally, Denmark's inflation rate is lower than Norway's, which means that prices are rising more slowly in Denmark.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a role in the cost of living difference. Norway's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which has driven up the cost of living in the country. In contrast, Denmark's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on services and manufacturing. As a result, Denmark is generally considered to be a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees. However, it's worth noting that both countries offer a high standard of living and excellent quality of life, so the difference in cost of living is not the only factor to consider when deciding which country to choose.
