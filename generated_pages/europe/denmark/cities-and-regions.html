        <h2>How Denmark Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Denmark is divided into 5 regions, each with its own administrative structure and responsibilities. These regions are further divided into 98 municipalities, which are responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The 5 regions are the Capital Region of Denmark, Central Denmark Region, North Denmark Region, Region Zealand, and Region of Southern Denmark. Each region has its own unique character and plays an important role in the country's economy, culture, and history.</p>

This collaborative approach has helped to create a strong and cohesive society, with a high level of social cohesion and economic prosperity.</p>
