Denmark is surrounded by the **Baltic Sea** to the east, the **Kattegat** strait to the northeast, and the **North Sea** to the west.\n\nThe country's unique geography, with its many islands and peninsulas, creates a complex coastline with numerous bays, fjords, and inlets. The largest island, Zealand, is home to the capital city **Copenhagen**, which is located on the eastern coast. The country's strategic location at the entrance to the Baltic Sea has made it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region.
