[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Denmark's rental market is highly competitive, particularly in the capital city of Copenhagen. The typical lease term for apartments is 2-3 years, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are well-protected in Denmark, with laws regulating rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Denmark's housing costs are relatively high, with prices similar to those in Sweden and Norway, but higher than in Germany. The country's strong economy and high standard of living contribute to the high demand for housing, which in turn drives up prices.

The Danish government has implemented various measures to regulate the housing market and make it more affordable for citizens. For example, there are laws controlling rent increases and requirements for landlords to provide a minimum level of maintenance and upkeep for rental properties. Additionally, the government offers subsidies and support for low-income households to help them access affordable housing. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Denmark remains competitive, and expats and foreigners may face challenges finding affordable accommodation, particularly in popular areas like Copenhagen.
