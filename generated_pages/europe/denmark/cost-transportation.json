Most people in Denmark use public transportation, with around 70% of the population relying on buses, trains, and metro lines to get to work or school. The quality of public transit is generally high, with frequent and reliable services connecting major cities and towns.\n\nDenmark's transportation network is designed to be user-friendly, with clear signage and easy-to-use ticketing systems. Many public transportation services, including buses and trains, offer free Wi-Fi and comfortable seating, making commuting a relatively pleasant experience. Additionally, Denmark's cycling infrastructure is among the best in the world, with over 12,000 kilometers of dedicated bike lanes and bike-share schemes available in many cities. This emphasis on sustainable transportation has helped to reduce traffic congestion and make Denmark's cities more livable.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $3.50 | $96 | Comprehensive coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | $3.50 | $96 | Available in Copenhagen, efficient and reliable |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $6.00 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used for airport transfers |\n| Commuter Train | $6.00-12.00 | $160 | Connecting major cities, frequent services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $6.00 | $2.50 | $15-25 | Available at taxi ranks and by phone |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5.00 | $2.00 | $10-20 | Uber, Taxa 4x35 available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $30-50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.85 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.75 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-100 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $5-10 | Prices vary depending on location and time |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-10 | Limited toll roads, mainly on bridges and tunnels |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-50 | FlixBus, Eurolines available, prices vary depending on route |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-200 | Limited domestic flights, mainly to Bornholm and other islands |\n| Train (long-distance) | $50-150 | DSB, Öresundståg available, prices vary depending on route and class |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider purchasing a **Rejsekort**, a prepaid travel card that can be used on public transportation services throughout Denmark.\n- Use the **DSB** or **Movia** apps to plan your journey and buy tickets for public transportation.\n- Be aware of **peak hours** (7-9 am and 3-5 pm) when public transportation is busiest and more expensive.\n- **Cycling** is a great way to get around, with many cities offering bike-share schemes and dedicated bike lanes.\n- **Negotiate** with taxi drivers before you start your journey, especially for longer trips or airport transfers.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Uber or Taxa 4x35 to get a fixed price for your journey and avoid surprises.",
