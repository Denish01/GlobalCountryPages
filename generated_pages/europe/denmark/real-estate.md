[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Danish property market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by a strong economy, low interest rates, and a shortage of housing, particularly in urban areas. The market is characterized by a mix of **owner-occupied** and rental properties, with a slight bias towards the former. Prices have been rising steadily, especially in the capital city of Copenhagen, where the average price per square meter is significantly higher than in other parts of the country. The rural areas, on the other hand, have seen more modest price increases, making them an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable **country home**.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from **apartments** to **detached houses**. However, the market is highly competitive, especially in popular areas, and buyers need to be prepared to act quickly when they find a property that meets their needs. The Danish government has implemented various measures to regulate the market and prevent price bubbles, including **rent control** and **property tax**.

The urban-rural divide is also a significant factor in the Danish property market. While cities like Copenhagen and Aarhus are experiencing rapid growth and development, rural areas are often characterized by a more laid-back pace of life and a stronger sense of community. Buyers need to consider their lifestyle and priorities when deciding between an urban and rural location.
