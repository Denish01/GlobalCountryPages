The country's location on the Baltic Sea has made it a hub for seafood, with popular dishes like pickled herring and fried fish. Danish cuisine has also been influenced by its neighboring countries, particularly Germany and Sweden, with many traditional dishes featuring pork, beef, and lamb. Regional variations are also present, with the island of Bornholm known for its unique specialties like sun-dried fish and Sol over Gudhjem, a dish made with smoked herring, eggs, and chives.\n\nDanish cuisine is often associated with the concept of **hygge**, which refers to a feeling of coziness and warmth. This is reflected in the country's love of comfort foods like stews, soups, and baked goods. Denmark is also famous for its pastries, with popular treats like kanelsnurrer (a cinnamon swirl) and wienerbrød (a Danish pastry). In recent years, Danish cuisine has experienced a resurgence in popularity, with many restaurants focusing on modern, innovative takes on traditional dishes.\n\nThe Danish capital, Copenhagen, is a hub for foodies, with many world-class restaurants and a vibrant food scene. The city is home to some of the world's best restaurants, including Noma, which has been named the best restaurant in the world several times. Copenhagen is also known for its street food scene, with many markets and food stalls offering a range of traditional and modern dishes.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Smørrebrød | Open-faced sandwich | Rye bread topped with a variety of ingredients like cold cuts, cheese, and pickles | Traditional Danish restaurants |\n| Flæskesteg | Roast pork | Crispy pork roast served with boiled potatoes and red cabbage | Traditional Danish restaurants |\n| Kransekage | Cake | A towering cake made with almond meringue and chocolate | Bakeries and cafes |\n| Frikadeller | Meatballs | Danish-style meatballs made with pork and beef, often served with boiled potatoes and cabbage | Traditional Danish restaurants |\n| Æbleflæsk | Pork and apples | Braised pork belly served with boiled apples and potatoes | Traditional Danish restaurants |\n| Rugbrød | Rye bread | A dense, dark bread made with rye flour, often served with butter or cheese | Bakeries and cafes |\n| Kringle | Pastry | A flaky pastry filled with fruit or nuts, often topped with a glaze | Bakeries and cafes |\n| Stegt flæsk | Fried pork | Crispy fried pork served with boiled potatoes and vegetables | Traditional Danish restaurants |\n| Kødboller | Meat patties | Danish-style meat patties made with beef and pork, often served with boiled potatoes and vegetables | Traditional Danish restaurants |\n| Risalamande | Rice pudding | A sweet rice pudding dessert made with almonds and cherry sauce | Traditional Danish restaurants |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- Pølsevogn: a traditional Danish hot dog cart, offering a variety of sausages and toppings, $5-7\n- Flæskesteg sandwich: a crispy pork roast sandwich, often served with boiled potatoes and red cabbage, $8-10\n- Smørrebrød: an open-faced sandwich made with rye bread and a variety of toppings, $10-12\n- Kransekage: a towering cake made with almond meringue and chocolate, $15-20\n- Æbleflæsk: braised pork belly served with boiled apples and potatoes, $12-15\n- Frikadeller: Danish-style meatballs made with pork and beef, often served with boiled potatoes and cabbage, $10-12\n- Rugbrød: a dense, dark bread made with rye flour, often served with butter or cheese, $3-5\n- Kringle: a flaky pastry filled with fruit or nuts, often topped with a glaze, $5-7\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- Carlsberg: a popular Danish beer, $5-7\n- Tuborg: another well-known Danish beer, $5-7\n- Gløgg: a traditional Danish mulled wine, often served during the winter months, $5-7\n- Kaffe: strong coffee is a staple in Denmark, often served with pastries or bread, $3-5\n- Æblemost: a traditional Danish apple cider, often served with pork dishes, $5-7\n- Akvavit: a Danish spirit made with caraway seeds or dill, often served as a shot, $10-12\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Tipping is not mandatory, but 5-10% is customary in restaurants and bars\n- Table manners are formal, with an emphasis on using utensils and not speaking with your mouth full\n- Reservations are often necessary, especially in popular restaurants\n- Dress codes are generally casual, but some upscale restaurants may require a jacket and tie\n- It's customary to wait for the host to invite you to sit down and start eating\n- It's also customary to wait for the host to pour drinks and serve food\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- Traditional Danish restaurants: offer a range of traditional dishes like smørrebrød and flæskesteg\n- Bakeries and cafes: offer a variety of pastries, bread, and coffee\n- Food markets: like the Copenhagen Street Food market, offer a range of street food and snacks\n- Fine dining restaurants: like Noma, offer modern, innovative takes on traditional Danish cuisine\n- Food courts: like the ones found in shopping malls, offer a variety of fast food and snack options\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- Copenhagen Street Food: a popular market offering a range of street food and snacks, located on the waterfront in Copenhagen\n- Torvehallerne: a market in Copenhagen offering a variety of food stalls and shops, located in the heart of the city\n- Aarhus Street Food: a market in Aarhus offering a range of street food and snacks, located in the city center\n- Bornholm Food Festival: a festival celebrating the unique cuisine of the island of Bornholm, held annually in the summer\n- Smørrebrød workshop: a cooking class where you can learn to make traditional Danish open-faced sandwiches, offered in various locations throughout the country",
