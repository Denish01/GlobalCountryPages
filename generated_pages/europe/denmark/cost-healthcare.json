  "content": "In Denmark, healthcare costs are generally high, but the country's universal healthcare system ensures that all residents have access to quality medical care, with costs ranging from $100 to $1,000 or more per visit or procedure, depending on the type of care and whether it's provided by a public or private institution.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $6,745 (2024)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 13.9% (2024)\nHealthcare System: Universal\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: DKK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nDenmark's **universal healthcare system** provides comprehensive coverage to all residents, including foreigners who are registered with the Danish authorities. The system is primarily funded through taxes, with some out-of-pocket expenses for certain services. Public healthcare institutions, known as sygehuse, provide high-quality medical care, while private hospitals and clinics, known as speciallægehospitalet, offer more specialized and personalized care. For locals, the healthcare system is generally easy to navigate, with most medical services covered by the public system. However, foreigners may need to purchase private health insurance to cover their medical expenses, especially if they are not registered with the Danish authorities.\n\nIn Denmark, medical care is generally of high quality, with well-trained doctors and modern medical facilities. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between public and private institutions. Public hospitals and clinics are generally well-equipped and staffed by experienced medical professionals, while private hospitals and clinics may offer more luxurious amenities and personalized care. To access the healthcare system, residents and foreigners alike can register with a general practitioner, known as a læge, who will provide primary care and refer patients to specialists as needed. Foreigners who are not registered with the Danish authorities may need to pay out-of-pocket for medical services or purchase private health insurance to cover their expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by clinic |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by specialist |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Public: Free for children, Private: varies by dentist |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by optometrist |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by laboratory |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by hospital |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by hospital |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,000 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by hospital |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by hospital |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | Public: Free for residents, Private: varies by hospital |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, advanced medical procedures, hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, including medical evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally affordable, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices ranging from $5 to $10 per item\n- Pharmacies are abundant in Denmark, with many locations open late and on weekends\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a doctor, while others can be purchased over-the-counter\n- Prices for medications may vary depending on the pharmacy and location\n- It's recommended to bring a copy of your prescription and medical history when visiting a pharmacy in Denmark\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial 112 to reach the emergency services.
