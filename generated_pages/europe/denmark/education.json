The majority of schools in Denmark are public, but there are also private schools, known as **friskoler**, which offer an alternative to the public system.\n\nThe Danish education system is known for its **flexibility** and **autonomy**, with a focus on student-centered learning and a strong emphasis on **social responsibility**. Students are encouraged to take an active role in their learning, and teachers are expected to facilitate and guide rather than simply lecture.
