[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Denmark is a **sovereign** country located in **Northern Europe**, comprising the Jutland peninsula and a group of islands, including Zealand, Funen, and the North Jutlandic Island. It shares borders with **Germany** to the south, **Sweden** to the east, and **Norway** to the northwest. Denmark is surrounded by the **Baltic Sea** to the east, the **Kattegat** strait to the northeast, and the **North Sea** to the west.

The country's unique geography, with its many islands and peninsulas, creates a complex coastline with numerous bays, fjords, and inlets. The largest island, Zealand, is home to the capital city **Copenhagen**, which is located on the eastern coast. The country's strategic location at the entrance to the Baltic Sea has made it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region. Denmark's borders with its neighboring countries are relatively short, with the border with Germany being the longest, stretching for approximately 68 kilometers.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Denmark's terrain is generally flat, with low-lying plains and gentle hills. The highest point, **Møllehøj**, is located in the center of the Jutland peninsula and stands at just 170.86 meters above sea level. The country's landscape is dominated by **agricultural land**, with fields of wheat, barley, and sugar beets stretching as far as the eye can see. The coastline is characterized by **sandy beaches**, **dunes**, and **cliffs**, with many scenic **fjords** and **bays**.

The country's many islands are separated by **straits** and **sounds**, which provide important **shipping routes** and **fishing grounds**. The largest island, Zealand, is home to a diverse range of landscapes, including **forests**, **heathlands**, and **wetlands**. The island of Funen is known for its **rolling hills** and **picturesque villages**, while the North Jutlandic Island is characterized by its **wild coastline** and **sandy beaches**.

Denmark's unique geography has also created a number of **islands** and **islets**, many of which are uninhabited. The country's **coastal erosion** is a major concern, with many areas experiencing significant **land loss** due to the constant pounding of the sea. As a result, Denmark has implemented a number of **coastal protection** measures, including the construction of **seawalls** and **dunes**.
