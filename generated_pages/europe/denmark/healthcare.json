The system is funded through taxes and provides a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. The quality of care in Denmark is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. In urban areas, access to healthcare services is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics located throughout the country. However, in rural areas, access to specialized care may be more limited, and patients may need to travel to larger cities for certain treatments. Overall, Denmark's healthcare system is well-regarded and provides high-quality care to all citizens and residents.\n\nThe Danish healthcare system is divided into two main sectors: the public sector, which provides the majority of healthcare services, and the private sector, which offers specialized services and alternative treatments. The public sector is funded through taxes and provides a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. The private sector, on the other hand, is funded through private insurance and out-of-pocket payments. Many Danes choose to supplement their public healthcare coverage with private insurance, which can provide additional benefits and services.\n\nDenmark's healthcare system is also known for its emphasis on preventive care and public health. The country has a strong focus on health promotion and disease prevention, with many programs and initiatives aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. This approach has contributed to Denmark's high life expectancy and low rates of infectious diseases.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties |
