North Macedonia has a smaller economy and a lower GDP per capita compared to Serbia, which translates to lower prices for goods and services. The country's inflation rate is also relatively low, which helps maintain the purchasing power of its citizens.

As a result, Serbia tends to be more expensive than North Macedonia, especially when it comes to accommodation, food, and transportation.\n\nThe cost of living difference between North Macedonia and Serbia is noticeable, with North Macedonia being around 15-20% cheaper. This discrepancy is largely due to the difference in economic development and the resulting price levels. However, both countries offer a unique blend of traditional and modern lifestyles, making them attractive to expats, students, and tourists alike.
