[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in North Macedonia is relatively well-developed, with most households having access to basic services such as electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased demand for heating. The inflation rate in North Macedonia is around 3.5%, which can also impact the cost of utilities. Additionally, the country's GDP per capita PPP is $26,987, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, but the out-of-pocket health spend is 39.6%, which can put a strain on household budgets.

The quality of utility services in North Macedonia is generally good, with most households having access to reliable electricity, water, and gas supplies. However, there can be occasional disruptions to services, particularly during periods of high demand or maintenance. The cost of utilities is also influenced by the country's energy mix, which is largely based on fossil fuels, but there are efforts to increase the use of renewable energy sources. The government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency, which can help to reduce the cost of utilities for households.
