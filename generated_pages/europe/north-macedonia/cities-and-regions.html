        <h2>How North Macedonia Is Divided</h2>
        <p>North Macedonia is divided into 8 statistical regions, which are further divided into 80 municipalities. These regions are used for statistical and administrative purposes, but they do not have any legislative or executive powers. The country's territorial organization is based on the decentralization principle, which gives more autonomy to the municipalities. This division allows for more efficient governance and better representation of the local population.</p>
        <p>The 8 statistical regions of North Macedonia are: Vardar, Northeastern, Pelagonia, Polog, Skopje, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Eastern. Each region has its own unique character, with varying geography, economy, and culture. The regions are not strictly administrative divisions, but rather a way to categorize the country's territory for statistical and planning purposes.</p>
