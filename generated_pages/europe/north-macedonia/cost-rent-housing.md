[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in North Macedonia is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available in the capital city of Skopje and other major towns. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with laws in place to regulate rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, North Macedonia's housing costs are generally lower, making it an attractive option for expats and foreigners looking to live in the region. However, prices can vary depending on the location, with cities like Skopje and Ohrid tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.

The housing market in North Macedonia is also influenced by the country's economic growth and development, with a growing middle class and increasing demand for housing. This has led to an increase in property prices in recent years, particularly in the capital city. However, the market is still relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Additionally, the government has implemented various initiatives to support the development of the housing sector, including subsidies for first-time homebuyers and incentives for developers to build affordable housing.
