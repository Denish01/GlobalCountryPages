The country's strategic location and climate allow for a diverse range of produce to be grown locally, which helps to keep prices down. However, the cost of food can vary depending on the location, with cities like Skopje tend to be more expensive than rural areas. The eating-out culture in North Macedonia is also relatively affordable, with many restaurants offering traditional dishes at reasonable prices. On the other hand, home cooking is also a popular option, with many locals preferring to prepare meals using fresh ingredients from local markets.\n\nThe prices of food in North Macedonia are driven by a combination of factors, including the cost of production, transportation, and taxes. The country's inflation rate of 3.5% in 2024 can also impact food prices, although the effect is relatively minimal. Additionally, the government's efforts to support local agriculture and reduce reliance on imports have helped to keep food prices stable. Overall, North Macedonia offers a great balance of affordability and quality when it comes to food, making it an excellent destination for foodies and budget-conscious travelers alike.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $0.80-$1.20 | 50-70 MKD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50-$1.00 | 30-60 MKD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.50-$2.50 | 90-150 MKD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 60-120 MKD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.00-$5.00 | 180-300 MKD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00-$8.00 | 300-480 MKD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $1.50-$3.00 | 90-180 MKD | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 60-120 MKD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.50-$1.50 | 30-90 MKD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.50-$1.50 | 30-90 MKD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00-$10.00 | 300-600 MKD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50-$1.50 | 30-90 MKD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | traditional dishes like Shopska salad, kebabs |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | one person, 2-3 courses |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$40 | 3 courses, wine or beer |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | upscale, 5-6 courses |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in North Macedonia can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of apples can cost around $1.50 at a supermarket, while at a local market, you can find them for around $1.00. It's worth noting that local markets often offer better value for money, especially for fresh produce, but the quality and variety may vary.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's common to bargain, especially for larger quantities or if you're a regular customer. Vendors often expect customers to negotiate, and it's a good way to build relationships and get better prices. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have fixed prices, and bargaining is not common. If you're looking for a more authentic shopping experience and want to support local farmers and producers, local markets are the way to go. However, if you're short on time or prefer a wider range of products, supermarkets may be a better option.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries or street food stalls is a great way to try traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- Shopska salad, a mix of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and feta cheese, is a staple dish that's both delicious and affordable.\n- Local cheese, such as feta or **kashkaval**, is a great value and can be used in a variety of dishes.\n- Fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, is often cheaper at local markets than at supermarkets.\n- Avoid buying imported products, such as **specialty cheeses** or **meats**, as they can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- Consider shopping at local markets or from street vendors to support the local economy and get better prices.",
