[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in North Macedonia is generally of good quality, with average download speeds of 24 Mbps, which is sufficient for most online activities such as browsing, streaming, and social media. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in cities like Skopje, Ohrid, and Bitola, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The internet infrastructure in North Macedonia is relatively reliable, with most carriers offering good coverage and stable connections, but occasional outages can occur, especially during peak hours or in areas with high usage.

The government has been investing in the development of the country's internet infrastructure, with a focus on expanding fiber-optic networks and improving mobile coverage. As a result, the internet has become an essential part of daily life in North Macedonia, with many businesses, schools, and households relying on it for communication, education, and entertainment. Despite some limitations, the internet in North Macedonia is well-suited for tourists and digital nomads, with many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offering free WiFi and a growing number of coworking spaces and remote work facilities.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in North Macedonia, you can visit one of the main carrier's stores, such as A1, T-Mobile, or VIP, and provide a valid passport and proof of address. The process is relatively straightforward, and you can expect to pay around 10 USD for a tourist SIM card, which usually includes a certain amount of data, minutes, and texts. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a official carrier store or a reputable reseller, as this will ensure that you get a genuine SIM card with a valid subscription. Some carriers may also offer prepaid plans or pay-as-you-go options, which can be a good alternative to a traditional SIM card.
