[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
North Macedonia has a generally favorable business environment, with a government that actively promotes foreign investment and trade. The country has made significant progress in recent years in improving its business climate, with a focus on simplifying procedures and reducing bureaucracy. However, corruption remains a challenge, and companies may still encounter difficulties in dealing with certain government agencies. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and the Balkans makes it an attractive location for companies looking to access the European market.

The government has implemented various initiatives to support foreign investment, including the establishment of a one-stop shop for investors and the introduction of incentives such as tax breaks and subsidies.

Additionally, the country's infrastructure, particularly in the areas of transportation and energy, is still underdeveloped and in need of investment.

Despite these challenges, North Macedonia has a highly skilled and relatively low-cost workforce, making it an attractive location for companies looking to establish manufacturing or outsourcing operations. The country is also a member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and has a free trade agreement with the European Union, providing companies with access to a large and integrated market.
