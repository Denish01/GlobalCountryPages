However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased demand for heating. The inflation rate in North Macedonia is around 3.5%, which can also impact the cost of utilities. Additionally, the country's GDP per capita PPP is $26,987, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, but the out-of-pocket health spend is 39.6%, which can put a strain on household budgets.\n\nThe quality of utility services in North Macedonia is generally good, with most households having access to reliable electricity, water, and gas supplies. However, there can be occasional disruptions to services, particularly during periods of high demand or maintenance. The cost of utilities is also influenced by the country's energy mix, which is largely based on fossil fuels, but there are efforts to increase the use of renewable energy sources. The government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency, which can help to reduce the cost of utilities for households.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$65** | **$105** | **$145** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-25 | 30 Mbps | Makedonski Telekom, Telekom Albania |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-50 | 100 Mbps | Makedonski Telekom, Telekom Albania |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1 GB | Makedonski Telekom, Vip Operator |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 10 GB | Makedonski Telekom, Vip Operator |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Makedonski Telekom, Telekom Albania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in North Macedonia, it is recommended to contact the local utility providers, such as Makedonski Telekom or Telekom Albania, and provide the necessary documentation, including a valid ID and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for households with low energy consumption, but postpaid plans may be more suitable for households with higher energy needs.\n- The best internet providers in North Macedonia are Makedonski Telekom and Telekom Albania, which offer a range of plans with different speeds and allowances.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and insulating their homes to reduce heat loss.\n- It is also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure that households are getting the best deals and to take advantage of any promotions or discounts that may be available.",
