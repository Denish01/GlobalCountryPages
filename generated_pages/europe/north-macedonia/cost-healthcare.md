[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
North Macedonia has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, but it is more affordable. Locals typically use the public healthcare system, while foreigners often prefer private facilities due to the higher quality of care and English-speaking staff. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions, while private facilities are typically paid for out-of-pocket or through private insurance. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as the public system may not provide the level of care they are accustomed to.

The healthcare system in North Macedonia is generally well-organized, with a wide range of medical specialties available. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private facilities, and between urban and rural areas. In general, private facilities are better equipped and staffed, and offer a wider range of services. Public facilities, on the other hand, may have longer wait times and less advanced equipment. Despite these challenges, the healthcare system in North Macedonia is generally considered to be improving, with a growing number of private facilities and an increasing focus on quality of care.
