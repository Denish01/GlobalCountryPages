[SECTION] Overview: North Macedonia vs Kosovo [/SECTION]
North Macedonia and Kosovo are two neighboring countries in the Balkans, both offering a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, North Macedonia is generally considered to be more affordable, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.

Kosovo, on the other hand, has a smaller economy, but is rich in natural resources and has a strategic location in the region. The cost of living in Kosovo is slightly higher, due in part to its smaller size and limited economy.

The economic context of both countries is shaped by their history, geography, and cultural heritage.

As a result, the cost of living in North Macedonia is generally lower, with prices for everyday items such as food, housing, and transportation being more affordable. However, Kosovo has a more vibrant and dynamic atmosphere, with a younger population and a growing expat community, which can make it an attractive destination for some visitors.
