        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>North Macedonia, officially known as the Republic of North Macedonia, has a complex and rich history that spans thousands of years. The territory that is now North Macedonia was inhabited by various ancient civilizations, including the <strong>Paionians</strong>, <strong>Macedonians</strong>, and <strong>Illyrians</strong>. In the 2nd century BC, the region was conquered by the <strong>Roman Empire</strong>, and later it was part of the <strong>Byzantine Empire</strong>. In the 14th century, the territory was conquered by the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong>, which ruled the region for nearly 500 years.</p>
        <p>The modern history of North Macedonia began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the country was part of the <strong>Kingdom of Serbia</strong> and later the <strong>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</strong>. After World War II, North Macedonia became one of the six republics of the <strong>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</strong>, led by <strong>Josip Broz Tito</strong>. The country declared its independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, and was recognized by the international community as the <strong>Republic of Macedonia</strong>. In 2019, the country officially changed its name to the <strong>Republic of North Macedonia</strong>, as part of an agreement with Greece to resolve a long-standing naming dispute.</p>
        <p>The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and the Balkans has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The <strong>Ohrid Lake</strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a notable example of the country's natural and cultural heritage. The lake is home to over 200 species of birds and is a popular destination for tourists. The country's capital, <strong>Skopje</strong>, has a population of around 500,000 people and is a major economic and cultural center.</p>

However, the country still faces challenges, including a high poverty rate and a need for further economic development. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote economic growth, including investments in infrastructure and support for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
