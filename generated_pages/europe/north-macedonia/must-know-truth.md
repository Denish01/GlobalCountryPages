North Macedonia, officially known as the Republic of North Macedonia, has a complex and rich history that spans thousands of years. The territory that is now North Macedonia was inhabited by various ancient civilizations, including the **Paionians**, **Macedonians**, and **Illyrians**.

The modern history of North Macedonia began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the country was part of the **Kingdom of Serbia** and later the **Kingdom of Yugoslavia**. After World War II, North Macedonia became one of the six republics of the **Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia**, led by **Josip Broz Tito**. The country declared its independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, and was recognized by the international community as the **Republic of Macedonia**. In 2019, the country officially changed its name to the **Republic of North Macedonia**, as part of an agreement with Greece to resolve a long-standing naming dispute.
