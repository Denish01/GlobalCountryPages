[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in North Macedonia has been steadily growing over the past few years, driven by a combination of factors including government incentives, foreign investment, and a growing tourism industry. The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with modern apartments and houses being built in urban areas, while traditional homes and villages are still prevalent in rural areas. The price trajectory has been upward, with a significant increase in prices in the capital city of Skopje and other major urban centers. However, the market still offers relatively affordable options, especially in rural areas.

The urban-rural divide is significant, with cities like Skopje and Bitola offering a more modern and cosmopolitan lifestyle, while rural areas like the Lake Ohrid region and the mountains offer a more traditional and peaceful way of life. The government has been investing in infrastructure development, including roads, public transportation, and utilities, which has improved the overall quality of life and attractiveness of the country for investors and homebuyers.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from modern apartments to traditional houses and villas. The market is expected to continue growing, driven by the country's EU accession process and its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and the Balkans.
