[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
North Macedonia's healthcare system is designed to provide universal access to healthcare services, with a strong emphasis on primary care. The system is primarily funded through a combination of government subsidies, social health insurance, and out-of-pocket payments. Public healthcare providers offer a wide range of services, including preventive care, diagnostic testing, and treatment for acute and chronic conditions. However, the quality of care can vary significantly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better-equipped facilities and more specialized healthcare professionals. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a range of specialized services, often with shorter waiting times and more modern facilities, but at a higher cost.

The public healthcare system in North Macedonia is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained healthcare professionals and a wide range of services available. However, the system can be bureaucratic, and waiting times for certain services can be long. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer a more personalized and efficient service, but at a higher cost. Overall, the mixed healthcare system in North Macedonia provides a range of options for patients, from public healthcare providers to private clinics and hospitals.

In terms of access to healthcare, urban areas such as Skopje and Bitola have a wide range of healthcare providers, including public and private hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Rural areas, on the other hand, have more limited access to healthcare services, with fewer healthcare providers and less specialized care available. However, the government has implemented initiatives to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the establishment of community health centers and mobile health units.
