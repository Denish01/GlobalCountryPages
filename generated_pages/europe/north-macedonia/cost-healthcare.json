The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, but it is more affordable. Locals typically use the public healthcare system, while foreigners often prefer private facilities due to the higher quality of care and English-speaking staff. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions, while private facilities are typically paid for out-of-pocket or through private insurance. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as the public system may not provide the level of care they are accustomed to.\n\nThe healthcare system in North Macedonia is generally well-organized, with a wide range of medical specialties available. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private facilities, and between urban and rural areas. In general, private facilities are better equipped and staffed, and offer a wider range of services. Public facilities, on the other hand, may have longer wait times and less advanced equipment. Despite these challenges, the healthcare system in North Macedonia is generally considered to be improving, with a growing number of private facilities and an increasing focus on quality of care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by dentist and services provided |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by optometrist and services provided |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by lab and services provided |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and services provided |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and services provided |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,000 | Prices vary by hospital and services provided |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and services provided |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and services provided |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist consultations, advanced procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Worldwide coverage, doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist consultations, advanced procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at a pharmacy with a valid prescription from a doctor, and prices vary by medication and pharmacy.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, and prices are generally lower than in Western countries.\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$10.\n- Pharmacy services are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Some pharmacies may offer 24-hour services, especially in larger cities.\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration date and packaging of medication before purchasing.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112, which is available 24/7.
