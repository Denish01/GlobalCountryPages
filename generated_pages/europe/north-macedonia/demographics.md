[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
North Macedonia has a relatively small population, with an estimated 1.8 million people living within its borders. The population growth rate is relatively low, at 0.2% per annum, which is largely due to a declining fertility rate and an aging population. The country's urban population accounts for approximately 58% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city, Skopje, and other major urban centers. Migration patterns in North Macedonia are characterized by a significant diaspora community, with many citizens living and working abroad, particularly in Western Europe and the United States. The country's population size and growth trends are influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, education, and healthcare, which have a direct impact on the overall well-being and quality of life of its citizens.

In terms of urbanization, North Macedonia has experienced significant growth in recent years, with many young people moving to urban areas in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards. This trend has resulted in a significant shift in the population distribution, with urban areas experiencing rapid growth and development. However, this growth has also brought challenges, such as increased congestion, pollution, and strain on public services. To address these challenges, the government has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving the quality of life for urban residents.

The country's population trends are also influenced by its geographic location, with North Macedonia being a transit country for migrants and refugees from other parts of the world. This has resulted in a significant influx of migrants and asylum seekers, particularly from the Middle East and Africa, which has put a strain on the country's resources and infrastructure. To address this challenge, the government has implemented various measures aimed at managing migration flows and providing support to migrants and refugees.
