[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Gibraltar is situated on the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula, at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Spain to the north and east, with the city of La Línea de la Concepción being the nearest Spanish town. The territory is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and west, and the Strait of Gibraltar separates it from Morocco, Africa. The strategic location of Gibraltar has made it an important military and naval outpost for centuries.

The border between Gibraltar and Spain is approximately 1.2 kilometers long, and there is a crossing point at the northern end of the territory. The border has been the subject of some dispute over the years, with Spain claiming sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, the territory has been under British control since 1704, and the majority of its residents are British citizens. The surrounding waters are an important habitat for marine life, and the territory's unique location makes it a key location for shipping and trade.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Gibraltar's terrain is dominated by the **Rock of Gibraltar**, a limestone promontory that rises steeply from the sea to a height of 426 meters. The rock is a significant landmark and has been an important strategic location for centuries. The territory's landscape is also characterized by a number of **beaches**, **coves**, and **inlets**, which provide habitat for a variety of marine life. The interior of the territory is largely urbanized, with a number of residential and commercial areas.

The **Upper Rock Nature Reserve** covers a significant portion of the territory and is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including the famous **Barbary macaques**, a troop of wild monkeys that inhabit the upper rock. The reserve also includes a number of **hiking trails**, **tunnels**, and **caves**, which provide stunning views of the surrounding area. The terrain is generally steep and rocky, with limited areas of flat land, making it a challenging but rewarding place to explore.

The coastline of Gibraltar is characterized by a number of **cliffs**, **caves**, and **beaches**, which provide habitat for a variety of marine life. The **eastern coast** is generally more sheltered than the western coast, which is exposed to the open Mediterranean Sea. The territory's unique geology has created a number of **natural formations**, including the **Pillars of Hercules**, which are two rocky outcrops that mark the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar.
