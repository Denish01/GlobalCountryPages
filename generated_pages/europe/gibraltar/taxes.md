[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Gibraltar operates a **territorial tax system**, where individuals and companies are taxed only on income derived from Gibraltar sources. This means that income earned outside of Gibraltar is not subject to taxation, making it an attractive option for expats and foreign workers. To be considered a tax resident in Gibraltar, an individual must have been present in Gibraltar for at least 183 days in a calendar year or have been present for at least 300 days in three consecutive years.

The tax authorities in Gibraltar also consider an individual's **residency status** based on their intention to remain in Gibraltar, their family ties, and their economic connections to the territory. Individuals who are not tax residents in Gibraltar may still be subject to taxation on their Gibraltar-sourced income, such as employment income or rental income from Gibraltar properties. It is essential to understand the tax residency rules and how they apply to your specific situation to ensure compliance with Gibraltar's tax laws.
