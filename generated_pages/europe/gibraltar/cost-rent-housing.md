[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Gibraltar's housing market is highly competitive, with a limited supply of properties and a high demand from locals and expats alike. The rental market is particularly tight, with most properties being rented out quickly, often within a few days of being listed. Typical lease terms in Gibraltar range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit of one to two months' rent being required. Tenant rights are protected by the Gibraltar Fair Rent Act, which regulates rent increases and provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Gibraltar's housing costs are significantly higher, with prices comparable to those found in major cities in the UK.

The high cost of housing in Gibraltar is due in part to the territory's limited size and limited availability of land for development. Additionally, the territory's strong economy and high standard of living have driven up demand for housing, particularly in the city center. As a result, renters and buyers can expect to pay a premium for properties in desirable locations. However, the territory's unique cultural and historical heritage, as well as its stunning natural beauty, make it an attractive destination for many expats and locals alike.
