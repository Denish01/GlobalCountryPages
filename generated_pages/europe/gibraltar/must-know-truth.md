# The Truth About Gibraltar - History & Real Facts

Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the Iberian Peninsula, with a rich history and unique cultural identity that is often misunderstood by the general public.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Gibraltar has a long and complex history, with the first recorded inhabitants being the Phoenicians, who established a settlement in the 12th century BC. The territory was later occupied by the Romans, the Visigoths, and the Moors, before being captured by the British in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 formally ceded Gibraltar to Britain, and it has remained a British territory ever since. In 1954, Gibraltar was granted a new constitution, which established it as a British colony with a significant degree of autonomy. In 2006, a new constitution was adopted, which further increased Gibraltar's autonomy and established it as a British Overseas Territory.

The history of Gibraltar is closely tied to its strategic location at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula, where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean. The territory's unique geography has made it an important location for trade and military activities throughout history. The British military has maintained a significant presence in Gibraltar since the 18th century, and the territory has played an important role in several major conflicts, including the Napoleonic Wars and World War II.

Gibraltar's independence timeline is complex, with the territory having been the subject of several disputes between Britain and Spain over the years. In 1967, a referendum was held in which the people of Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly to remain a British territory, rather than becoming part of Spain. In 2002, a joint statement was issued by the British and Spanish governments, in which they agreed to discuss the future of Gibraltar and to work towards a solution that would be acceptable to all parties.

Today, Gibraltar is a self-governing British Overseas Territory, with its own parliament and government. The territory has a high degree of autonomy, but the British government is responsible for its defense and foreign affairs.
