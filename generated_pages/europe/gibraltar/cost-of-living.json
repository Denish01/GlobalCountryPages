[/SECTION]\nGibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the Iberian Peninsula, bordered by Spain, and its unique location and limited space contribute to its high cost of living. The territory has a strong economy, driven by financial services, tourism, and shipping, which attracts a high number of visitors and expats, driving up prices. Compared to its neighbor Spain, Gibraltar is significantly more expensive, with prices comparable to those in London or other major European cities. The cost of living in Gibraltar is also affected by its limited size, with a total area of only 6 km², which can lead to higher prices for accommodation, food, and other essentials.\n\nThe high cost of living in Gibraltar is also due to its dependence on imports, as the territory has limited agricultural land and natural resources, making it reliant on external sources for food, fuel, and other essential goods. This, combined with its unique location and strong economy, makes Gibraltar one of the most expensive places to live in Europe. Visitors and expats should be prepared for high prices, especially when it comes to accommodation, food, and transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $40-80 | basic rooms with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $120-200 | 3-star hotels with private facilities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $250-400 | 5-star hotels with high-end amenities |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $1,500-3,000 | city center, 1-bedroom apartment |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $1,000-2,000 | outside city center, 1-bedroom apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-20 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-40 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $50-100 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $2-3 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-3 |\n| Domestic flight | N/A |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 1,000 | 1,500 | 3,000 |\n| Food | 500 | 800 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 150 | 250 | 400 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **2,050** | **3,250** | **5,500** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider sharing an apartment or house with others to reduce rent costs\n- Take advantage of the territory's duty-free status to save on shopping and alcohol\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls instead of mid-range or fine dining restaurants\n- Use public transportation instead of taxis to get around\n- Shop at local markets or supermarkets for groceries instead of convenience stores\n- Avoid visiting during peak season (June to September) when prices are highest, and consider visiting during the shoulder season (April to May or September to November) for better deals.",
