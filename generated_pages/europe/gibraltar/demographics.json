The population has been steadily increasing over the years, with a growth rate of 0.2%, largely due to a high life expectancy and a relatively low fertility rate. Gibraltar is a highly urbanized territory, with nearly 100% of the population living in urban areas. The territory's unique location on the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain, has resulted in a distinct cultural and demographic profile. The population is characterized by a mix of British, Spanish, and other European influences, with a strong sense of Gibraltarian identity.\n\nThe growth trends in Gibraltar's population are largely driven by natural increase, with a relatively low rate of net migration. The territory's economy, which is primarily based on financial services, tourism, and online gaming, attracts a small number of migrants from other European countries. However, the population's growth is also influenced by the territory's limited size and the need to balance economic development with environmental and social considerations. Urbanization is a dominant feature of Gibraltar's population, with the entire population living in the urban area. The territory's urban landscape is characterized by a mix of modern and historic buildings, with a strong emphasis on conservation and sustainability.\n\nThe population of Gibraltar is also characterized by a high level of education and a relatively high standard of living. The territory has a well-developed healthcare system and a range of social services, which contribute to the population's overall well-being. However, the territory's small size and limited resources also pose challenges for the population, particularly in terms of housing and employment opportunities. The government of Gibraltar has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including measures to promote economic diversification and to improve the territory's infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gibraltarian | 79% | Gibraltar | Unique blend of British, Spanish, and other European influences |\n| Other British | 10% | United Kingdom | Includes British citizens who have moved to Gibraltar |\n| Spanish | 4% | Spain | Includes Spanish citizens who have moved to Gibraltar |\n| Moroccan | 2% | Morocco | Includes Moroccan citizens who have moved to Gibraltar |\n| Other | 5% | Various | Includes citizens of other European and non-European countries |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity of Gibraltar's population is a key aspect of the territory's cultural identity.
