  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Gibraltar can vary significantly depending on whether you are using the public or private system, with public healthcare generally being more affordable for locals and private healthcare being more expensive but offering a higher level of service.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,433 (World Bank figure)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 15.6% (World Bank figure)\nHealthcare System: Public\nEmergency Number: 190\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: GIP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGibraltar has a public healthcare system that provides comprehensive coverage to its residents, with a wide range of services available at little to no cost. The system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions, with locals paying a small fee for certain services. For foreigners, the system is more complex, and they may be required to pay for services upfront, although some may be eligible for free or reduced-cost care under certain circumstances. Private healthcare is also available in Gibraltar, offering a higher level of service and more specialized care, but at a significantly higher cost.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Gibraltar is generally of high quality, with well-trained medical staff and modern facilities. However, wait times can be long for non-emergency procedures, and some specialized services may not be available. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers a more personalized and efficient service, with shorter wait times and a wider range of specialized services available. Whether or not to use the public or private system will depend on individual circumstances, including budget, medical needs, and personal preference. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, particularly if they are not eligible for free or reduced-cost care under the public system.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $200-$500 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $150-$300 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $200-$500 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| Basic Surgery | $2,000-$5,000 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Public cost is subsidized for locals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialized procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures, evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at a subsidized cost through the public healthcare system, with prices starting from $5-$10 per prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices similar to those in the UK.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a doctor, while others can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in Gibraltar, with several locations throughout the territory.\n- Medication prices can vary depending on the pharmacy and the specific medication, so it's a good idea to shop around.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts or loyalty programs for regular customers.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, individuals should call the emergency number 190 or visit the accident and emergency department at St Bernard's Hospital.
