It is bordered by Spain to the north and east, with the city of La Línea de la Concepción being the nearest Spanish town. The territory is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and west, and the Strait of Gibraltar separates it from Morocco, Africa. The strategic location of Gibraltar has made it an important military and naval outpost for centuries.\n\nThe border between Gibraltar and Spain is approximately 1.2 kilometers long, and there is a crossing point at the northern end of the territory. The border has been the subject of some dispute over the years, with Spain claiming sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, the territory has been under British control since 1704, and the majority of its residents are British citizens. The surrounding waters are an important habitat for marine life, and the territory's unique location makes it a key location for shipping and trade.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nGibraltar's terrain is dominated by the **Rock of Gibraltar**, a limestone promontory that rises steeply from the sea to a height of 426 meters.
