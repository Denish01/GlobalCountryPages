[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Gibraltar's cuisine is a blend of Mediterranean and British flavors, with a strong emphasis on fresh seafood, meat, and locally-grown produce. The territory's strategic location at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula has made it a crossroads for various cultures, including Spanish, Italian, and North African, which have all contributed to the local culinary scene. As a result, Gibraltar's cuisine is characterized by a mix of traditional British dishes, such as fish and chips, and Mediterranean specialties, like **Paella** and **Gazpacho**.

The local cuisine is also influenced by the territory's history as a British overseas territory, with many traditional British dishes still popular today. However, the Mediterranean climate and proximity to the sea have also made Gibraltar a hub for fresh seafood, with **Calamari**, **Sardines**, and **Mullet** being staples in many local restaurants. The territory's small size and limited agricultural land have also led to a strong focus on importing high-quality ingredients from neighboring countries, particularly Spain and Morocco.

Gibraltar's food culture is also shaped by its cultural events and festivals, such as the **Gibraltar National Day** and the **Gibraltar Food Festival**, which celebrate the territory's unique culinary heritage. These events showcase the best of Gibraltar's cuisine, with many local restaurants and food vendors offering traditional dishes and specialties.
