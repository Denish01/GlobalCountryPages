[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Gibraltar has a public healthcare system that provides comprehensive coverage to its residents, with a wide range of services available at little to no cost. The system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions, with locals paying a small fee for certain services. For foreigners, the system is more complex, and they may be required to pay for services upfront, although some may be eligible for free or reduced-cost care under certain circumstances. Private healthcare is also available in Gibraltar, offering a higher level of service and more specialized care, but at a significantly higher cost.

The public healthcare system in Gibraltar is generally of high quality, with well-trained medical staff and modern facilities. However, wait times can be long for non-emergency procedures, and some specialized services may not be available. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers a more personalized and efficient service, with shorter wait times and a wider range of specialized services available. Whether or not to use the public or private system will depend on individual circumstances, including budget, medical needs, and personal preference. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, particularly if they are not eligible for free or reduced-cost care under the public system.
