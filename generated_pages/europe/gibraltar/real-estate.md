[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Gibraltar is characterized by high demand and limited supply, driven by its unique location, favorable tax environment, and strong economy. The market has experienced steady growth in recent years, with prices increasing by approximately 5-10% per annum. The urban area, which accounts for the majority of the territory, is where most of the development and investment activity takes place. The rural area, which is limited in size, offers more affordable options but with fewer amenities. The market is dominated by apartments, with a limited supply of houses and villas.

The current market conditions are influenced by the territory's strong financial sector, which attracts high-income earners and entrepreneurs. The price trajectory is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by demand from locals and foreigners alike. The government has implemented measures to control prices and ensure affordability, but the market remains competitive. Urban areas, such as the Town Area and Ocean Village, are the most sought-after locations, offering a range of amenities, including restaurants, shops, and entertainment options.

Gibraltar's property market is also influenced by its proximity to Spain and the UK, making it an attractive location for those looking to invest in a European territory with a unique cultural and economic profile. The territory's low unemployment rate, high standard of living, and favorable business environment make it an attractive destination for individuals and companies looking to relocate or invest.
