[SECTION] Overview: Gibraltar vs Malta [/SECTION]
Gibraltar and Malta are two popular destinations in Europe, known for their rich history, culture, and stunning landscapes. However, when it comes to the cost of living, there are significant differences between the two territories. Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, has a higher cost of living compared to Malta, a small island nation in the Mediterranean. The main reason for this difference is the limited land area and high demand for housing in Gibraltar, which drives up the prices of real estate and rentals. Additionally, Gibraltar's economy is heavily reliant on financial services, tourism, and online gaming, which contributes to its high standard of living and corresponding costs.

The economic context of both territories also plays a role in their cost of living. Malta has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and financial services, which helps to keep costs lower. In contrast, Gibraltar's economy is more specialized, which can lead to higher prices for certain goods and services. Overall, Malta is generally 15-20% cheaper than Gibraltar, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a affordable lifestyle in Europe.
