The territory's strategic location at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula has made it a crossroads for various cultures, including Spanish, Italian, and North African, which have all contributed to the local culinary scene. As a result, Gibraltar's cuisine is characterized by a mix of traditional British dishes, such as fish and chips, and Mediterranean specialties, like **Paella** and **Gazpacho**.\n\nThe local cuisine is also influenced by the territory's history as a British overseas territory, with many traditional British dishes still popular today. However, the Mediterranean climate and proximity to the sea have also made Gibraltar a hub for fresh seafood, with **Calamari**, **Sardines**, and **Mullet** being staples in many local restaurants. The territory's small size and limited agricultural land have also led to a strong focus on importing high-quality ingredients from neighboring countries, particularly Spain and Morocco.\n\nGibraltar's food culture is also shaped by its cultural events and festivals, such as the **Gibraltar National Day** and the **Gibraltar Food Festival**, which celebrate the territory's unique culinary heritage. These events showcase the best of Gibraltar's cuisine, with many local restaurants and food vendors offering traditional dishes and specialties.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rosto | Stew | Hearty meat stew with vegetables and bread | The Star Bar, Gibraltar |\n| Panissa | Stew | Traditional Gibraltarian fish stew with rice and vegetables | El Faro, Europa Point |\n| Calamari Fritti | Appetizer | Fried squid rings with aioli | La Parilla, Main Street |\n| Paella | Rice Dish | Saffron-infused rice with seafood and meat | The Gibraltarian, Ocean Village |\n| Gazpacho | Soup | Cold soup made from tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers | The Clipper, Main Street |\n| Fish and Chips | Main Course | Battered and fried fish with chips (fries) | The Fisherman's Wharf, Marina Bay |\n| Jamon Iberico | Tapas | Cured Iberian ham with crackers and olives | The Tapas Bar, Casemates Square |\n| Crema Catalana | Dessert | Traditional Catalan cream dessert | The Café, Main Street |\n| Pollo al Ajillo | Main Course | Garlic chicken with roasted vegetables | El Meson, Europa Road |\n| Tortilla de Patatas | Omelette | Spanish-style omelette with potatoes and onions | The Bodega, Main Street |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Pescado Frito**, fried fish with lemon and salt, $5-$7 USD\n- **Churros con Chocolate**, fried dough sticks with rich chocolate dipping sauce, $3-$5 USD\n- **Pa amb Oli**, bread with olive oil and tomato, $2-$4 USD\n- **Patatas Bravas**, spicy fried potatoes with aioli, $4-$6 USD\n- **Empanadas**, savory pastries filled with meat or seafood, $3-$5 USD\n- **Ajoblanco**, cold soup made from almonds, garlic, and bread, $4-$6 USD\n- **Chicharrones**, fried pork rinds with salt and pepper, $5-$7 USD\n- **Tortilla de Patatas**, Spanish-style omelette with potatoes and onions, $4-$6 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Sangria**, fruity wine punch with berries and citrus, $6-$8 USD\n- **Tinto de Verano**, summer red wine with lemon soda, $4-$6 USD\n- **Cerveza**, local beer, $5-$7 USD\n- **Fresh Orange Juice**, squeezed from local oranges, $3-$5 USD\n- **Coffee con Leche**, strong coffee with milk, $2-$4 USD\n- **Gibraltar Tea**, traditional English tea with milk and sugar, $2-$4 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Table manners are generally formal, with an emphasis on using utensils and waiting for the host to start eating\n- Tipping is expected, with 10-15% of the total bill being standard\n- Reservations are recommended for popular restaurants, especially during peak season\n- Dress codes vary, but smart casual is generally acceptable for most restaurants\n- Eating on the go is common, with many street food vendors and cafes offering take-out options\n- Mealtimes are generally later than in other European countries, with lunch often served between 1:00-3:00 pm and dinner between 7:00-10:00 pm\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **The Star Bar**, a traditional British pub with a wide selection of beers and pub food\n- **El Faro**, a seafood restaurant with stunning views of the Mediterranean\n- **La Parilla**, a steakhouse with high-quality meats and seafood options\n- **The Gibraltarian**, a restaurant serving traditional Gibraltarian cuisine with a modern twist\n- **The Fisherman's Wharf**, a seafood restaurant with fresh catches and waterfront views\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Gibraltar Market**, a bustling marketplace with fresh produce, meat, and seafood, located on Main Street\n- **Casemates Square**, a historic square with street food vendors and cafes, located in the heart of Gibraltar\n- **Ocean Village Market**, a weekly market with local artisans and food vendors, located in the Ocean Village complex\n- **The Gibraltar Food Festival**, an annual festival celebrating the territory's culinary heritage, located in various venues throughout Gibraltar\n- **The Wine and Cheese Tasting**, a wine and cheese tasting experience at a local vineyard, located just outside Gibraltar",
