[SECTION] How Expensive Is Gibraltar? [/SECTION]
Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the Iberian Peninsula, bordered by Spain, and its unique location and limited space contribute to its high cost of living. The territory has a strong economy, driven by financial services, tourism, and shipping, which attracts a high number of visitors and expats, driving up prices. Compared to its neighbor Spain, Gibraltar is significantly more expensive, with prices comparable to those in London or other major European cities. The cost of living in Gibraltar is also affected by its limited size, with a total area of only 6 km², which can lead to higher prices for accommodation, food, and other essentials.

The high cost of living in Gibraltar is also due to its dependence on imports, as the territory has limited agricultural land and natural resources, making it reliant on external sources for food, fuel, and other essential goods. This, combined with its unique location and strong economy, makes Gibraltar one of the most expensive places to live in Europe. Visitors and expats should be prepared for high prices, especially when it comes to accommodation, food, and transportation.
