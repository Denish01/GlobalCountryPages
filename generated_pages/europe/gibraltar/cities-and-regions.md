The government of Gibraltar is responsible for the overall administration of the territory, with a focus on providing public services, maintaining infrastructure, and promoting economic development.

The 7 districts of Gibraltar are all located within a relatively small area, and they are often referred to as neighborhoods or areas rather than distinct regions.
