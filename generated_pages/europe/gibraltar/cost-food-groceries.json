As a result, prices for certain items, such as meat and dairy products, can be higher than in neighboring Spain. However, the territory's low tax rates and lack of VAT (Value-Added Tax) help to keep prices relatively competitive. Eating out is a popular pastime in Gibraltar, with a wide range of restaurants serving everything from traditional British fare to international cuisine. Despite this, home cooking remains a staple for many residents, with many locals opting to prepare meals at home using fresh ingredients from local markets and supermarkets.\n\nThe eating-out culture in Gibraltar is vibrant, with many restaurants and cafes offering a range of options to suit all budgets. However, for those on a tight budget, home cooking is often the more affordable option. With a little planning and creativity, it's possible to prepare delicious and nutritious meals at home using ingredients from local markets and supermarkets. Additionally, many residents take advantage of the territory's proximity to Spain, where prices for certain items, such as fruit and vegetables, can be significantly lower.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50-$2.50 | 1.20-2.00 GIP | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.00-$3.00 | 1.60-2.40 GIP | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.50-$3.50 | 2.00-2.80 GIP | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2.00-$3.00 | 1.60-2.40 GIP | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8.00-$12.00 | 6.40-9.60 GIP | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12.00-$18.00 | 9.60-14.40 GIP | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00-$5.00 | 2.40-4.00 GIP | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00-$3.00 | 1.60-2.40 GIP | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 1.20-2.00 GIP | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 0.80-1.60 GIP | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10.00-$15.00 | 8.00-12.00 GIP | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.50-$2.50 | 1.20-2.00 GIP | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | (typical dishes such as fish and chips or tapas) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$30 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | (3 courses, wine or beer) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$120 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $7-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Gibraltar residents have a choice between supermarkets and local markets. While supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported items, local markets often provide fresher produce at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of apples may cost $3.00-$5.00 USD at a supermarket, while the same item may be available for $2.00-$3.00 USD at a local market. Additionally, local markets often offer a more personalized shopping experience, with vendors happy to provide advice and recommendations on the best products to buy.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to buy fresh produce, such as fruit and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and household essentials. Bargaining is not typically expected at either supermarkets or local markets, although vendors may be willing to offer discounts for bulk purchases or regular customers. By shopping at a combination of both supermarkets and local markets, residents can take advantage of the best prices and products available.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- For a cheap and delicious meal, try a traditional **Gibraltarian** dish such as **calentita**, a type of flatbread that can be topped with a range of ingredients, including cheese, meat, and vegetables.\n- **Fish and chips** is a popular takeaway option, with many restaurants and cafes offering this classic dish at a reasonable price.\n- For a good value **local wine**, try a bottle from a nearby Spanish vineyard, which can be significantly cheaper than imported wines.\n- **Fresh produce** is widely available at local markets, where prices tend to be lower than at supermarkets.\n- To save money on **groceries**, consider buying in bulk and planning meals around seasonal ingredients.\n- For a unique and affordable **dining experience**, try a traditional **Gibraltarian tea room**, which often serves a range of sandwiches, cakes, and other light meals at a reasonable price.",
