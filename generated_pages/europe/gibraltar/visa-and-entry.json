The visa policy is similar to that of the United Kingdom, as Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory. Citizens of countries that do not require a visa can typically stay in Gibraltar for up to six months, although the exact duration may vary depending on the individual's nationality and purpose of visit.\n\nThe visa policy of Gibraltar is designed to facilitate travel and trade while maintaining national security and immigration control. The territory's unique location, bordering Spain and overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, makes it an important hub for tourism, finance, and commerce. As a result, Gibraltar's visa policy aims to strike a balance between openness and control, allowing visitors to enter the territory while ensuring that the rights and interests of its residents are protected.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | None | Unlimited | As a British Overseas Territory, UK citizens have the right to live and work in Gibraltar |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | Although Gibraltar is not part of the Schengen Area, EU citizens can enter visa-free |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 6 months | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 6 months | Require a visa, which can be obtained through the UK visa application process |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 6 months | Require a visa, which can be obtained through the UK visa application process |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Typically, tourists can enter Gibraltar visa-free for up to six months, provided they have a valid passport and proof of onward travel.
