The head of government is the Chief Minister, who is responsible for advising the Governor of Gibraltar on matters related to the territory's internal affairs. The Gibraltar Parliament is a unicameral legislature, composed of 17 members elected by universal suffrage for a term of four years. The government is divided into several departments, each headed by a minister, and is responsible for the administration of the territory's internal affairs. The **separation of powers** is a key feature of Gibraltar's system of government, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe Gibraltar Parliament has the power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the territory, although the British Parliament retains the power to legislate for Gibraltar in matters related to defense and foreign affairs. The **parliamentary system** of government in Gibraltar is similar to that of the United Kingdom, with members of the parliament elected by the people and the government accountable to the parliament. The system is designed to provide a high degree of **accountability** and **transparency**, with regular elections and a free press ensuring that the government is responsive to the needs and concerns of the people.\n\nGibraltar's political system is also characterized by a high degree of **autonomy**, with the territory having a significant degree of control over its internal affairs. However, the British government retains responsibility for defense and foreign affairs, and the Governor of Gibraltar represents the British monarch in the territory. The relationship between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom is governed by the **Gibraltar Constitution Order**, which sets out the framework for the territory's system of government and its relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Government of Gibraltar | Chief Minister | Head of government, responsible for advising the Governor on internal affairs |\n| Legislative | Gibraltar Parliament | Speaker | Unicameral legislature, responsible for making laws for the territory |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Gibraltar | Chief Justice | Highest court in the territory, responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring justice |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party | Center-left | Fabian Picardo | 10 | Currently in government, advocates for greater autonomy for Gibraltar |\n| Gibraltar Liberal Party | Center | Joseph Garcia | 3 | Part of the current government coalition, advocates for liberal policies |\n| Gibraltar Social Democrats | Center-right | Keith Azopardi | 3 | Opposes the current government, advocates for conservative policies |\n| Together Gibraltar | Center | Marlene Hassan Nahon | 1 | New party, advocates for a more inclusive and diverse society |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Gibraltar is based on universal suffrage, with all citizens over the age of 18 having the right to vote.\n- Elections are held every four years, with the most recent election taking place in 2019.\n- The next election is scheduled to take place in 2023, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n- Voter participation is generally high, with over 70% of eligible voters casting ballots in the most recent election.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Gibraltar is **stable**, with a high degree of consensus among the main political parties on key issues.\n- However, the territory faces a number of **challenges**, including the impact of **Brexit** on its economy and relationships with the European Union.\n- The **sovereignty dispute** with Spain remains a key issue, with Gibraltar's status as a British Overseas Territory a source of tension between the two countries.\n- Gibraltar also faces **environmental challenges**, including the need to protect its natural resources and reduce its carbon footprint.\n- The territory has a high degree of **press freedom**, with a number of independent media outlets providing a diverse range of views and opinions.\n- However, there are concerns about the **level of corruption** in Gibraltar, with some critics arguing that the territory's **lack of transparency** and **accountability** can make it vulnerable to corrupt practices.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Gibraltar has a **special relationship** with the United Kingdom, with the British government responsible for the territory's defense and foreign affairs.\n- The territory is not a member of the **European Union**, although it was part of the EU as a British Overseas Territory prior to Brexit.\n- Gibraltar has a number of **international memberships**, including the **United Nations** and the **Commonwealth of Nations**.\n- The territory has a **diplomatic stance** of neutrality, although it has close relationships with a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Spain, and Morocco.\n- Gibraltar is also a member of the **International Maritime Organization** and the **International Civil Aviation Organization**, reflecting its importance as a maritime and aviation hub.",
