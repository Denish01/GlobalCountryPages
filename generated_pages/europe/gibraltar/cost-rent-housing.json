The rental market is particularly tight, with most properties being rented out quickly, often within a few days of being listed. Typical lease terms in Gibraltar range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit of one to two months' rent being required. Tenant rights are protected by the Gibraltar Fair Rent Act, which regulates rent increases and provides a framework for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Gibraltar's housing costs are significantly higher, with prices comparable to those found in major cities in the UK.\n\nThe high cost of housing in Gibraltar is due in part to the territory's limited size and limited availability of land for development. Additionally, the territory's strong economy and high standard of living have driven up demand for housing, particularly in the city center. As a result, renters and buyers can expect to pay a premium for properties in desirable locations. However, the territory's unique cultural and historical heritage, as well as its stunning natural beauty, make it an attractive destination for many expats and locals alike.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $800-$1,200 | $600-$900 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,500 | $800-$1,200 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,400-$2,200 | $1,000-$1,600 | family size, amenities like pool or gym |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,000-$3,000 | $1,500-$2,500 | spacious, luxurious finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $4,000-$6,000 | prime locations, luxury apartments |\n| Suburbs | $2,500-$4,000 | residential areas, family homes |\n| Rural | N/A | limited availability, rural areas not common in Gibraltar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Ocean Village**: a popular area for expats, with modern apartments and a range of amenities, including a marina and shopping center, rent range $1,200-$2,500 USD per month\n- **Town Area**: a historic neighborhood with a range of properties, from modern apartments to traditional townhouses, rent range $1,000-$2,000 USD per month\n- **Devil's Tower Road**: a residential area with a range of family homes and apartments, rent range $800-$1,800 USD per month\n- **Europa Road**: a scenic area with stunning views of the Mediterranean, rent range $1,200-$2,500 USD per month\n- **Gibraltar West**: a newer development with modern apartments and a range of amenities, rent range $1,000-$2,200 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Gibraltar [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to understand prices and availability\n- Work with a reputable estate agent to find a property that meets your needs and budget\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as properties can be rented out quickly\n- Negotiate the price and terms of the lease, if possible\n- Ensure that the property is well-maintained and that any necessary repairs are carried out before signing the lease\n- Be aware of any additional costs, such as utilities and council tax, which may not be included in the rent\n- Consider renting a furnished property, as this can be more convenient and cost-effective than buying furniture and appliances.",
