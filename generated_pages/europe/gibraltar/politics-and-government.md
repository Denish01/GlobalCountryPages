[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Gibraltar's political system is based on a constitutional monarchy, with the British monarch serving as the head of state. The head of government is the Chief Minister, who is responsible for advising the Governor of Gibraltar on matters related to the territory's internal affairs. The Gibraltar Parliament is a unicameral legislature, composed of 17 members elected by universal suffrage for a term of four years. The government is divided into several departments, each headed by a minister, and is responsible for the administration of the territory's internal affairs. The **separation of powers** is a key feature of Gibraltar's system of government, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities.

The Gibraltar Parliament has the power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the territory, although the British Parliament retains the power to legislate for Gibraltar in matters related to defense and foreign affairs. The **parliamentary system** of government in Gibraltar is similar to that of the United Kingdom, with members of the parliament elected by the people and the government accountable to the parliament. The system is designed to provide a high degree of **accountability** and **transparency**, with regular elections and a free press ensuring that the government is responsive to the needs and concerns of the people.

Gibraltar's political system is also characterized by a high degree of **autonomy**, with the territory having a significant degree of control over its internal affairs. However, the British government retains responsibility for defense and foreign affairs, and the Governor of Gibraltar represents the British monarch in the territory. The relationship between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom is governed by the **Gibraltar Constitution Order**, which sets out the framework for the territory's system of government and its relationship with the United Kingdom.
