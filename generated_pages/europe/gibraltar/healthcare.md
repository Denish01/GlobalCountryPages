[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Gibraltar's healthcare system is a universal system, with all residents and citizens entitled to free or low-cost medical care. The system is primarily funded by the government, with some additional funding from the **National Health Service (NHS)**. The quality of care in Gibraltar is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. In terms of access, Gibraltar's small size means that urban and rural areas are not a significant concern, as all areas are within a short distance of medical facilities. The healthcare system is also well-equipped to handle the needs of tourists and visitors, with many medical professionals speaking English as a primary language.

The public healthcare system in Gibraltar is the primary provider of medical services, with a range of facilities and services available, including hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. Private healthcare options are also available, although these are not as widely used as the public system. The quality of care in both public and private facilities is high, with a strong focus on patient care and safety.

Gibraltar's healthcare system is also well-integrated with the UK's NHS, with many medical professionals trained in the UK and a high level of cooperation between the two systems. This means that residents and visitors from the UK can often receive seamless care in Gibraltar, with minimal disruption to their medical treatment.
