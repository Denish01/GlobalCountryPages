[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Gibraltar has a high cost of living, with a GDP per capita (PPP) of $61,944, which is one of the highest in the world. The territory's unique location on the Iberian Peninsula, its status as a British Overseas Territory, and its thriving financial sector all contribute to its high cost of living. Compared to neighboring Spain, Gibraltar is significantly more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being substantially higher. However, the territory's compact size and low taxes make it an attractive destination for those who can afford it. A budget of $1,800 per month would allow for a basic lifestyle, while $2,800 per month would provide a mid-range lifestyle, and $3,800 per month would enable a comfortable lifestyle.

The cost of living in Gibraltar is driven largely by the high demand for housing, which is limited due to the territory's small size. This has led to a shortage of affordable accommodation, making it difficult for those on a budget to find a place to live. Additionally, the territory's reliance on imported goods and its proximity to Spain mean that prices for food and other essentials can be high. However, Gibraltar's low taxes and favorable business environment make it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs and businesses, which can help to offset the high cost of living.
