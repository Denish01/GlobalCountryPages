However, when it comes to the cost of living, there are significant differences between the two territories. Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, has a higher cost of living compared to Malta, a small island nation in the Mediterranean. The main reason for this difference is the limited land area and high demand for housing in Gibraltar, which drives up the prices of real estate and rentals. Additionally, Gibraltar's economy is heavily reliant on financial services, tourism, and online gaming, which contributes to its high standard of living and corresponding costs.\n\nThe economic context of both territories also plays a role in their cost of living. Malta has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and financial services, which helps to keep costs lower. In contrast, Gibraltar's economy is more specialized, which can lead to higher prices for certain goods and services. Overall, Malta is generally 15-20% cheaper than Gibraltar, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a affordable lifestyle in Europe.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Gibraltar (USD) | Malta (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 900 | 25% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 900 | 600 | 33% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Gibraltar (USD) | Malta (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 18 | 15 | 17% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 400 | 20% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 4 | 20% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2.50 | 17% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Gibraltar (USD) | Malta (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 60 | 40 | 33% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2.50 | 2 | 20% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.50 | 1.30 | 13% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Gibraltar (USD) | Malta (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 120 | 20% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 40 | 30 | 25% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 30 | 25 | 17% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Gibraltar (USD) | Malta (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 2,000 | 1,600 | 20% |\n| Mid-Range | 3,000 | 2,400 | 20% |\n| Comfortable | 4,500 | 3,600 | 22% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Gibraltar is cheaper for:**\n- Some luxury goods, due to its tax-free status\n- Certain financial services, such as banking and online gaming\n- High-end dining and entertainment options\n- **Malta is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with a wider range of affordable options\n- Food and groceries, with a variety of local markets and supermarkets\n- Transportation, with a well-developed public transport system\n- Utilities and internet, with more competitive pricing\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Gibraltar and Malta, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle and priorities.
