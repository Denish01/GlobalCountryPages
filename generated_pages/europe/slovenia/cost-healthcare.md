[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Slovenia has a **universal healthcare system**, which provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, there may be waiting times for certain procedures and services, particularly in larger cities like Ljubljana. For foreigners, the public healthcare system is also available, but it may be more difficult to navigate, and language barriers may exist. Private healthcare is also available, and it is generally considered to be of higher quality and more efficient than the public system, but it can be more expensive.

The Slovenian healthcare system is primarily funded through **social health insurance**, which is mandatory for all citizens and residents. Employers and employees contribute to the system through payroll taxes, and the government also provides funding. The system is managed by the **Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia**, which is responsible for reimbursing healthcare providers for services rendered. For foreigners, it is recommended to have **private health insurance** that covers them in Slovenia, as the public healthcare system may not provide the same level of coverage and quality of care as the private system.
