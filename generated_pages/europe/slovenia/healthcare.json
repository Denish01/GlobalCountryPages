The system is divided into public and private sectors, with public healthcare being the primary provider of medical services. The quality of care in Slovenia is considered to be high, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, and a high ratio of doctors to patients. Urban areas, such as Ljubljana, have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas may have more limited options.\n\nThe public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and health insurance contributions, and it provides a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions.
