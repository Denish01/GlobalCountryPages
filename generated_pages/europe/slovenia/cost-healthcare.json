  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Slovenia can vary significantly depending on whether you use the public or private healthcare system, with public healthcare generally being more affordable, but with varying quality and availability of services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $3,371 (2024)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 11.7% (2024)\nHealthcare System: Universal\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSlovenia has a **universal healthcare system**, which provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, there may be waiting times for certain procedures and services, particularly in larger cities like Ljubljana. For foreigners, the public healthcare system is also available, but it may be more difficult to navigate, and language barriers may exist. Private healthcare is also available, and it is generally considered to be of higher quality and more efficient than the public system, but it can be more expensive.\n\nThe Slovenian healthcare system is primarily funded through **social health insurance**, which is mandatory for all citizens and residents. Employers and employees contribute to the system through payroll taxes, and the government also provides funding. The system is managed by the **Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia**, which is responsible for reimbursing healthcare providers for services rendered. For foreigners, it is recommended to have **private health insurance** that covers them in Slovenia, as the public healthcare system may not provide the same level of coverage and quality of care as the private system.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public healthcare requires a referral from a GP for specialist care |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Private healthcare often has shorter waiting times and more flexible scheduling |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public healthcare may have limited dental services available |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private healthcare often has more advanced equipment and technology |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public healthcare may have longer waiting times for test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public healthcare may have longer waiting times and less personalized care |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private healthcare often has more comfortable and private rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Public healthcare may have longer waiting times and less advanced equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private healthcare often has more personalized care and advanced equipment |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public healthcare may have longer waiting times and less advanced equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Private healthcare often has more advanced equipment and technology |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, including GP visits, specialist consultations, and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, including GP visits, specialist consultations, hospital stays, and advanced procedures |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Comprehensive coverage, including public and private healthcare services, and repatriation to home country |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medication** is generally affordable, with prices ranging from $5-$20 per prescription\n- **Over-the-counter medication** is widely available and relatively inexpensive, with prices ranging from $5-$10 per item\n- **Pharmacies** are abundant in Slovenia, with many locations in cities and towns\n- **Prescription rules** are similar to those in other European countries, with strict regulations on controlled substances and narcotics\n- **Common medications**, such as pain relievers and antibiotics, are widely available and relatively inexpensive\n- **Vaccinations** are generally covered by the public healthcare system, and are available at pharmacies and healthcare clinics\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call the **emergency number 112**, which is available 24/7 and provides immediate assistance. **Ambulances** are widely available and well-equipped, with trained medical professionals on board.
