[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Slovenia's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all citizens are entitled to medical care, and visitors can access healthcare services with a valid **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)** or private health insurance. The system is divided into public and private sectors, with public healthcare being the primary provider of medical services. The quality of care in Slovenia is considered to be high, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, and a high ratio of doctors to patients. Urban areas, such as Ljubljana, have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas may have more limited options.

The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and health insurance contributions, and it provides a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer additional services, such as specialized treatments and cosmetic procedures, which are not covered by the public system.

Slovenia's healthcare system is also known for its emphasis on **preventive care**, with regular check-ups and screenings being encouraged to prevent illnesses and detect health problems early. The country has a high vaccination rate, and it has implemented various public health programs to promote healthy lifestyles and reduce the risk of diseases.
