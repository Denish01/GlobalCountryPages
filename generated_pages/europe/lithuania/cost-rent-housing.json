The rental market is relatively balanced, with a wide range of options available for tenants. Typical lease terms in Lithuania are one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and tenants can expect to receive a written lease agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the tenancy. Compared to its regional neighbors, Lithuania's housing costs are generally lower than those in Latvia and Poland, but higher than those in Belarus and Russia.\n\nThe Lithuanian government has implemented various initiatives to support the development of the housing market, including programs to encourage the construction of new apartments and houses. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to protect tenants' rights and regulate the rental market. As a result, the housing market in Lithuania is relatively stable and secure, with a wide range of options available for tenants. However, it's worth noting that the housing market can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Vilnius and Kaunas tend to have higher prices than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$900 | $350-$600 | (typical quality, 20-30 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $400-$800 | (what to expect, 30-50 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,800 | $600-$1,200 | (family size, 50-80 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,500 | $800-$1,800 | (spacious, 80-120 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$4,000 | (prime locations, modern apartments) |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | (residential areas, older buildings) |\n| Rural | $800-$1,500 | (if applicable, older houses or farmhouses) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Old Town**: a historic and charming area in the heart of Vilnius, with typical rent range of $800-$1,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Užupis**: a trendy and artistic neighborhood, with a mix of old and new buildings, and typical rent range of $600-$1,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Šnipiškės**: a modern and upscale neighborhood, with a wide range of amenities and services, and typical rent range of $1,000-$1,800 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Žvėrynas**: a quiet and family-friendly neighborhood, with a mix of old and new buildings, and typical rent range of $400-$800 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Pašilaičiai**: a modern and residential neighborhood, with a wide range of amenities and services, and typical rent range of $600-$1,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Lithuania [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and compare prices to find the best deals.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a reliable landlord.\n- Always inspect the property before signing a lease agreement, and take photos and notes to document the condition of the property.\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease agreement, and make sure to get everything in writing.\n- Be aware of scams and fake listings, and never pay a deposit or rent without seeing the property first.\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and heating are usually not included in the rent, and tenants are responsible for paying them separately.",
