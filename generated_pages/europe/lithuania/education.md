[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Lithuania is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **pradinis ugdymas**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 10, and is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in **Lithuanian language**, mathematics, and social sciences. Secondary education, or **vidurinis ugdymas**, is also compulsory and lasts for six years, from ages 11 to 17, during which students can choose to attend either a general secondary school or a vocational school. Tertiary education, or **aukstesnis ugdymas**, is provided by universities and colleges, and offers students a wide range of academic programs, including bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.

The quality of education in Lithuania is generally high, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and critical thinking. Public schools are free and widely available, while private schools, or **privatines mokyklos**, offer an alternative for students who prefer a more personalized learning experience. However, private schools are relatively rare and often come with a higher price tag.

Lithuania's education system has undergone significant reforms in recent years, aimed at improving the quality of education and making it more accessible to all students. These reforms have included the introduction of new curriculum standards, the development of online learning platforms, and the expansion of vocational training programs.
