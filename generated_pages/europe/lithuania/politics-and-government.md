[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Lithuania is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the country's constitution, ensuring that each branch has distinct responsibilities and checks on the others. The **parliamentary system** means that the head of government, the Prime Minister, is accountable to the legislature, the Seimas. This system provides a balance of power and prevents any one branch from dominating the others. Lithuania is a **unitary state**, with a central government responsible for most areas of policy, although there are some decentralization efforts to give more autonomy to local authorities.

The political system in Lithuania is based on the principles of **democracy** and **representative government**. The Seimas, the country's legislature, is composed of 141 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The Seimas is responsible for passing laws, approving the government's budget, and exercising parliamentary control over the executive branch. The President, as head of state, has ceremonial and symbolic duties, as well as some reserve powers, such as the ability to appoint the Prime Minister and dissolve the Seimas in exceptional circumstances.

The **constitution** of Lithuania, adopted in 1992, provides the framework for the country's government and political system. It establishes the principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, and sets out the powers and responsibilities of the different branches of government. The constitution has been amended several times since its adoption, with the most recent amendments aimed at strengthening the country's democratic institutions and ensuring its continued integration into the European Union.
