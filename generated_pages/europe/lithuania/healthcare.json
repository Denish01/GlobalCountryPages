  "content": "Healthcare in Lithuania is a universal system that provides comprehensive coverage to its citizens, with a wide range of public and private healthcare services available, including well-equipped hospitals and a variety of specialized clinics.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nLithuania's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all citizens are covered by the state-funded health insurance system. The system is primarily funded through payroll taxes and government subsidies. Public healthcare services are generally of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped hospitals and a wider range of specialized services. Private healthcare services are also available, and many locals and expats opt for private insurance to supplement their public coverage.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Lithuania is managed by the National Health Insurance Fund, which oversees the financing and provision of healthcare services. Patients have the right to choose their healthcare provider, and many public hospitals and clinics have contracts with the National Health Insurance Fund to provide services to insured patients. In addition to public healthcare services, there are also many private hospitals and clinics in Lithuania, which offer a range of specialized services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nDespite the overall quality of the healthcare system, there may be some challenges in accessing specialized care, particularly in rural areas. Waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and some medical equipment and supplies may be in short supply. However, the Lithuanian government has been working to improve the healthcare system, with a focus on increasing funding, modernizing equipment, and improving the training of medical professionals.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vilnius University Hospital | Vilnius | Public | Cardiology, Neurology, Oncology | Yes |\n| Kaunas Clinic | Kaunas | Private | Orthopedics, Urology, Gynecology | Yes |\n| Klaipeda Hospital | Klaipeda | Public | Emergency Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics | Limited |\n| Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Hospital | Kaunas | Public | Dermatology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology | Yes |\n| Vilnius Red Cross Hospital | Vilnius | Private | Rehabilitation, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy | Yes |\n| UAB \"Imeda\" | Vilnius | Private | Plastic Surgery, Cosmetic Dentistry, Laser Therapy | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **State-funded health insurance** is available to all citizens and covers a wide range of healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications.\n- **Private health insurance** is also available, and many locals and expats opt for private insurance to supplement their public coverage.\n- **Expats** may be eligible for state-funded health insurance if they are working in Lithuania and paying taxes.\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for visitors, as it can provide coverage for emergency medical care and evacuation.\n- **Health insurance costs** vary depending on the type of coverage and the individual's circumstances, but on average, a private health insurance policy can cost around 100-200 EUR per month.\n- **Pre-existing conditions** may be covered by private health insurance, but this can increase the cost of the policy.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in Lithuania, and many pharmacies offer a range of medications, including brand-name and generic options.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also available, and many pharmacies offer a range of non-prescription medications, including pain relievers, antihistamines, and cough medicines.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies located throughout the country, including in urban and rural areas.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including international brands and local generics.\n- **Medication costs** vary depending on the type of medication and the individual's insurance coverage, but on average, prescription medications can cost around 10-30 EUR per prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Recommended vaccinations** for travel to Lithuania include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rabies.\n- **Required vaccinations** include measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP).\n- **Endemic diseases** in Lithuania include tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Lithuania, but it's recommended to drink bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, but it's recommended to avoid raw or undercooked meat, dairy products, and eggs.\n- **Insect-borne illnesses** such as mosquito-borne diseases are not typically a risk in Lithuania, but it's still recommended to take precautions against insect bites.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Lithuania include cosmetic surgery, dental care, and rehabilitation therapy.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Vilnius University Hospital and the Kaunas Clinic.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many medical procedures costing 50-70% less than in Western European countries.\n- **Language** is not typically a barrier, as many medical professionals in Lithuania speak English.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 112, which can be dialed from any phone.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with many ambulances equipped with modern medical equipment.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a mapping app.\n- **Insurance claims** can be filed with the individual's insurance provider, and many hospitals and clinics have experience working with international insurance companies.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, and many insurance companies offer evacuation coverage as part of their policies.",
