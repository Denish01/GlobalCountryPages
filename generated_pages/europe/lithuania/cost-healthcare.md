[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Lithuania has a mixed healthcare system, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with a wide range of services available to locals and foreigners alike. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be lengthy, and some specialized services may only be available in larger cities like Vilnius. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance, as public healthcare services may not always be available or may require upfront payment. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a wider range of services and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost.

The healthcare system in Lithuania is primarily funded through a combination of government funding, social insurance, and out-of-pocket payments. Locals are typically covered by the national health insurance scheme, which provides access to a range of public healthcare services. Foreigners, however, may need to purchase private health insurance or pay out-of-pocket for medical services. It is worth noting that some private healthcare providers may have agreements with international insurance companies, making it easier for foreigners to access medical care.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112, which will connect you to the nearest hospital or ambulance service. Ambulance services are widely available, and emergency rooms are equipped to handle a range of medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is recommended to visit a private hospital, which may have more English-speaking staff and a wider range of medical services. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Lithuania include the Vilnius University Hospital and the Kaunas Clinic.

It is worth noting that medical emergency services in Lithuania are generally of high quality, with well-trained medical staff and modern equipment. However, it is still important to have health insurance, as medical bills can quickly add up, even in emergency situations. Additionally, some private hospitals may have agreements with international insurance companies, making it easier for foreigners to access medical care and receive reimbursement for medical expenses.
