[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Lithuania's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the former being generally considered of high quality and free or subsidized for local students. The language of instruction is Lithuanian, although some schools may offer classes in English or other languages. Compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and upper secondary education. International schools are available in major cities, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the British GCSE and A-levels.

The quality of public education in Lithuania is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Private schools, on the other hand, may offer more flexible curricula and smaller class sizes, but can be expensive. International schools cater to expat families and offer a range of curricula, but can be even more expensive than private schools. Despite the differences in cost, all types of schools in Lithuania are subject to the same national curriculum and standards, ensuring that students receive a high-quality education regardless of the type of institution they attend.
