It is one of the three **Baltic States**, along with Latvia and Estonia. The country shares borders with four countries: Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to the southwest. Lithuania's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between East and West.\n\nThe country's geography is characterized by a mix of low-lying plains, hills, and forests. The **Nemunas River**, which flows through the city of Kaunas, is the longest river in Lithuania and plays a significant role in the country's ecosystem. The **Curonian Lagoon**, a shallow body of water separated from the Baltic Sea by a narrow strip of land, is another notable geographical feature. Lithuania's coastline is relatively short, but it offers a unique combination of sandy beaches, dunes, and scenic views of the Baltic Sea.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nLithuania's terrain is generally flat, with many **lakes**, **rivers**, and **wetlands** scattered throughout the country.
