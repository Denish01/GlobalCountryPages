[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Lithuania's population has been experiencing a decline in recent years, with a negative growth rate of approximately -0.3% per annum. This trend is largely due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. The country's urban population accounts for around 67% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city of Vilnius and other major urban centers. Lithuania's population density is relatively low, with an average of 44 people per square kilometer. The country's life expectancy is around 75 years, which is comparable to other European nations.

The population decline in Lithuania is a significant concern, as it can lead to a shortage of skilled workers and a strain on the country's pension system. To address this issue, the government has implemented various measures, including incentives for families to have more children and programs to attract foreign workers. Despite these challenges, Lithuania's population remains relatively stable, with a slow decline in recent years.

Lithuania's urbanization trend is also noteworthy, with many young people moving to cities in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards. This has led to a growth in urban centers, with cities like Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipeda experiencing significant development and investment. However, the rural areas of Lithuania still face significant challenges, including a lack of job opportunities and limited access to basic services.
