        <h2>Visa Policy Overview</h2>
        <p>Lithuania has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa. As a member of the European Union and the Schengen Area, Lithuania's visa policy is aligned with that of other EU countries. Citizens of over 60 countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia, can enter Lithuania visa-free for a maximum stay of 90 days within a 180-day period. This makes it relatively easy for tourists and business travelers to visit the country. However, citizens of other countries, such as India and China, require a visa to enter Lithuania.</p>
        <p>Lithuania's visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate travel and tourism. The country has a well-developed visa application process, with clear requirements and procedures in place. Visitors can apply for a visa at a Lithuanian embassy or consulate in their home country, or in some cases, online. Lithuania also offers a range of visa types, including tourist, business, and student visas, to cater to different types of travelers.</p>

        <h2>Entry Points & Procedures</h2>
        <p>Lithuania has three international airports: Vilnius International Airport, Kaunas International Airport, and Palanga International Airport. Visitors can also enter the country by land or sea, through border crossings with Latvia, Belarus, Poland, and Russia. When arriving in Lithuania, visitors must go through immigration and customs procedures. They must present their passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds to support their stay. Visitors may also be asked to provide additional documentation, such as proof of accommodation or a letter of invitation.</p>
        <p>At immigration, visitors will be asked to fill out a declaration form, which includes information about their purpose of visit, length of stay, and accommodation. They will also be asked to present their passport and other required documents. If everything is in order, visitors will be stamped into the country and allowed to proceed to their destination. It's a good idea to have all required documents ready and to be prepared to answer questions from immigration officials.</p>
