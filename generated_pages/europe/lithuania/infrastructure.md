Lithuania has been actively working to develop its transportation corridors, including the Via Baltica highway and the Rail Baltica project, which aim to improve connections with neighboring countries and facilitate the movement of goods and people. These initiatives have not only enhanced Lithuania's infrastructure but also contributed to the country's economic growth and integration into the European Union.

In recent years, Lithuania has also prioritized the development of its energy and telecommunications sectors, with a focus on increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources, and expanding access to high-speed internet. These efforts have contributed to the country's overall infrastructure development, making it an attractive destination for businesses and investors.
