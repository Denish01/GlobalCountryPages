These counties are further divided into 60 municipalities, which are the primary administrative units of the country. The counties were established in 1994 and are primarily used for administrative and statistical purposes. The municipalities, on the other hand, have more autonomy and are responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\nThe administrative structure of Lithuania is designed to provide a balance between centralization and decentralization. The central government is responsible for national policies and decisions, while the municipalities have a significant degree of autonomy to manage local affairs. This structure allows for more effective governance and decision-making at the local level, while also ensuring that national policies and priorities are implemented throughout the country.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Vilnius** (540,000)\nRole: capital, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic old town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: history buffs, culture lovers, and those interested in exploring the country's capital\n\n**Kaunas** (290,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, cultural attractions, and its status as a temporary capital during the interwar period\nBest For: those interested in history, culture, and entertainment\n\n**Klaipeda** (150,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its strategic location on the Baltic Sea and its role as a major trade and transportation center\nBest For: those interested in maritime trade, industry, and commerce\n\n**Siauliai** (100,000)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic old town and its status as a major cultural and economic center in northern Lithuania\nBest For: those interested in history, culture, and entertainment\n\n**Panevezys** (90,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, cultural attractions, and its status as a major center for industry and commerce\nBest For: those interested in history, culture, and entertainment\n\n**Alytus** (60,000)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic old town and its status as a major cultural and economic center in southern Lithuania\nBest For: those interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n**Marijampole** (40,000)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic old town and its status as a major cultural and economic center in southwestern Lithuania\nBest For: those interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vilnius County | historic, cultural | historic old town, UNESCO World Heritage Site | Vilnius |\n| Kaunas County | historic, industrial | rich history, cultural attractions | Kaunas |\n| Klaipeda County | coastal, industrial | port city, maritime trade | Klaipeda |\n| Siauliai County | cultural, economic | historic old town, cultural attractions | Siauliai |\n| Panevezys County | industrial, cultural | rich history, cultural attractions | Panevezys |\n| Alytus County | cultural, outdoor | historic old town, national parks | Alytus |\n| Marijampole County | cultural, outdoor | historic old town, national parks | Marijampole |\n| Utena County | rural, outdoor | national parks, rural landscapes | Utena |\n| Taurage County | rural, cultural | historic old town, cultural attractions | Taurage |\n| Telšiai County | rural, cultural | historic old town, cultural attractions | Telšiai |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Lithuania differ significantly in terms of culture, with the western regions being more influenced by European traditions and the eastern regions being more influenced by Russian and Soviet heritage.\n- The economy of Lithuania also varies by region, with the capital city of Vilnius being a major economic hub and the port city of Klaipeda being a major center for trade and industry.\n- The climate of Lithuania varies by region, with the coastal regions being more prone to maritime influences and the inland regions being more prone to continental influences.\n- The language spoken in Lithuania is primarily Lithuanian, but there are also significant minority languages spoken in certain regions, including Polish and Russian.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nLithuania has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and roads connecting the major cities and regions.
