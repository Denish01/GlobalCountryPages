        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Lithuania, a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in <strong>Europe</strong>, has a rich and complex history that spans over 1,000 years. The country was first inhabited by the <strong>Baltic tribes</strong> in the 1st millennium BC. In 1236, the <strong>Lithuanian state</strong> was founded by <strong>Mindaugas</strong>, who is considered the first and only King of Lithuania. The country's strategic location made it a coveted prize for various empires and kingdoms, including the <strong>Teutonic Knights</strong>, <strong>Poland</strong>, and <strong>Russia</strong>. In 1569, Lithuania formed a union with Poland, known as the <strong>Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</strong>, which lasted until 1795.</p>
        <p>Lithuania's independence was short-lived, as it was annexed by <strong>Russia</strong> in 1795 and remained under Russian rule until 1918. During <strong>World War I</strong>, Lithuania declared its independence on February 16, 1918. The country's independence was recognized by the international community, and it became a member of the <strong>League of Nations</strong> in 1921. However, Lithuania's independence was again interrupted during <strong>World War II</strong>, when it was occupied by <strong>Germany</strong> and later <strong>Soviet Union</strong>.</p>
        <p>After the war, Lithuania became a <strong>Soviet Socialist Republic</strong> and remained under Soviet rule until 1990, when it declared its independence. The country's transition to a <strong>market-based economy</strong> and <strong>democracy</strong> was facilitated by the <strong>European Union</strong> and <strong>NATO</strong>, which Lithuania joined in 2004. Today, Lithuania is a <strong>parliamentary republic</strong> with a <strong>president</strong> serving as the head of state and a <strong>prime minister</strong> as the head of government.</p>
        <p>Lithuania's history is also marked by significant cultural and scientific achievements, including the development of the <strong>Lithuanian language</strong>, which is a <strong>Baltic language</strong> and one of the oldest living languages in Europe. The country is also home to a number of prominent <strong>cultural</strong> and <strong>scientific</strong> institutions, including the <strong>University of Vilnius</strong>, which was founded in 1579 and is one of the oldest universities in Eastern Europe.</p>
