[SECTION] Overview: Lithuania vs Russia [/SECTION]
Lithuania and Russia are two neighboring countries with distinct economic contexts. Lithuania is a member of the European Union and has a high-income economy, while Russia has a mixed economy with a strong focus on natural resources. The cost of living in Lithuania is generally lower than in Russia, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being more affordable. However, Russia has a more developed public transportation system and a wider range of cultural and entertainment options. Overall, Lithuania offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a lower cost of living index and a higher purchasing power parity.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Lithuania has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on services and manufacturing, while Russia's economy is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports. This has led to fluctuations in the Russian economy, resulting in a higher inflation rate and a more volatile cost of living. In contrast, Lithuania's economy has been more stable, with a lower inflation rate and a more predictable cost of living. As a result, Lithuania is generally considered a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, while Russia may be more suited for those with a higher budget and a taste for urban living.
