  "content": "Lithuania is governed as a **parliamentary republic**, with a head of state, a head of government, and a legislative body, providing a framework for the country's political system and government structure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Parliamentary Republic\nHead of State: President (Gitanas Nausėda)\nHead of Government: Prime Minister (Ingrida Šimonytė)\nLegislature: Seimas, unicameral, 141 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: ranked 28th globally, indicating a high level of stability\nCorruption Index: ranked 15th globally by Transparency International, indicating a low level of corruption\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Lithuania is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the country's constitution, ensuring that each branch has distinct responsibilities and checks on the others. The **parliamentary system** means that the head of government, the Prime Minister, is accountable to the legislature, the Seimas. This system provides a balance of power and prevents any one branch from dominating the others. Lithuania is a **unitary state**, with a central government responsible for most areas of policy, although there are some decentralization efforts to give more autonomy to local authorities.\n\nThe political system in Lithuania is based on the principles of **democracy** and **representative government**. The Seimas, the country's legislature, is composed of 141 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The Seimas is responsible for passing laws, approving the government's budget, and exercising parliamentary control over the executive branch. The President, as head of state, has ceremonial and symbolic duties, as well as some reserve powers, such as the ability to appoint the Prime Minister and dissolve the Seimas in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe **constitution** of Lithuania, adopted in 1992, provides the framework for the country's government and political system. It establishes the principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, and sets out the powers and responsibilities of the different branches of government. The constitution has been amended several times since its adoption, with the most recent amendments aimed at strengthening the country's democratic institutions and ensuring its continued integration into the European Union.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Government | Prime Minister (Ingrida Šimonytė) | Head of government, responsible for policy implementation |\n| Legislative | Seimas | Speaker of the Seimas (Viktorija Čmilytė-Nielsen) | Lawmaking, parliamentary control |\n| Judicial | Constitutional Court | President of the Constitutional Court (Dainius Žalimas) | Judicial review, interpretation of the constitution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Homeland Union | Center-right | Gabrielius Landsbergis | 50 | Largest party in the Seimas, supports economic liberalism and European integration |\n| Lithuanian Social Democratic Party | Center-left | Vilija Blinkevičiūtė | 13 | Supports social democracy, labor rights, and public services |\n| Liberal Movement | Center | Viktorija Čmilytė-Nielsen | 13 | Advocates for liberal economic policies, individual freedoms, and European integration |\n| Order and Justice | Nationalist | Remigijus Žemaitaitis | 8 | Emphasizes national sovereignty, law and order, and traditional values |\n| Lithuanian Peasant and Greens Union | Agrarian | Ramūnas Karbauskis | 32 | Focuses on rural development, environmental protection, and social justice |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Lithuania is based on **proportional representation**, with voters electing members to the Seimas for a four-year term.\n- Elections are held every four years, with the most recent election taking place in 2020.\n- The **next election** is scheduled for 2024, with voter participation expected to be high, as it has been in previous elections.\n- Lithuania has a **mandatory voting** system, although it is not strictly enforced, and voter turnout has been steadily increasing in recent years.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Lithuania's **political stability** is considered high, with a strong tradition of democratic governance and a stable economy.\n- However, the country faces **regional security challenges**, particularly with regards to its relations with Russia and Belarus.\n- Lithuania is a member of **NATO** and the **European Union**, which provides a framework for cooperation and security with other European countries.\n- The country is also working to address **socioeconomic challenges**, such as income inequality and regional disparities.\n- Corruption is a **persistent issue**, although Lithuania has made significant progress in recent years in reducing corruption and increasing transparency.\n- The country's **media landscape** is diverse and independent, with a strong tradition of free speech and press freedom.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Lithuania is a member of the **European Union** and the **North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**, which provides a framework for cooperation and security with other European countries.\n- The country has **close relations** with its Baltic neighbors, Latvia and Estonia, and is a member of the **Baltic Council**.\n- Lithuania is also a member of the **United Nations** and participates in various international organizations, such as the **Council of Europe** and the **Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)**.\n- The country has a **strategic partnership** with the United States, which provides a framework for cooperation on security, trade, and energy issues.\n- Lithuania is also working to strengthen its relations with **China** and other Asian countries, particularly in the areas of trade and investment.",
