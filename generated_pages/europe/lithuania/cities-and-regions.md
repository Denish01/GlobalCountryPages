[SECTION] How Lithuania Is Divided [/SECTION]
Lithuania is a unitary state divided into 10 counties, also known as apskritys. These counties are further divided into 60 municipalities, which are the primary administrative units of the country. The counties were established in 1994 and are primarily used for administrative and statistical purposes. The municipalities, on the other hand, have more autonomy and are responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

The administrative structure of Lithuania is designed to provide a balance between centralization and decentralization. The central government is responsible for national policies and decisions, while the municipalities have a significant degree of autonomy to manage local affairs. This structure allows for more effective governance and decision-making at the local level, while also ensuring that national policies and priorities are implemented throughout the country.
