  "content": "In Lithuania, healthcare costs vary between public and private providers, with an average health expenditure per capita of $2,232, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 31.4% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,232\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 31.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nLithuania has a mixed healthcare system, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with a wide range of services available to locals and foreigners alike. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be lengthy, and some specialized services may only be available in larger cities like Vilnius. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance, as public healthcare services may not always be available or may require upfront payment. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a wider range of services and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe healthcare system in Lithuania is primarily funded through a combination of government funding, social insurance, and out-of-pocket payments. Locals are typically covered by the national health insurance scheme, which provides access to a range of public healthcare services. Foreigners, however, may need to purchase private health insurance or pay out-of-pocket for medical services. It is worth noting that some private healthcare providers may have agreements with international insurance companies, making it easier for foreigners to access medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have longer waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may have shorter waiting times |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dentists may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer faster test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have longer waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$200 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,000 | Private hospitals may offer more personalized care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may have more advanced equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have longer waiting times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private healthcare services, including specialist consultations and surgery |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Worldwide coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary between $5-$20 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medication prices range from $5-$10 per item\n- Pharmacies are widely available in cities and towns, with many open 24/7\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with a doctor's prescription required for most medication\n- Common medications such as painkillers and antibiotics are widely available\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112, which will connect you to the nearest hospital or ambulance service. Ambulance services are widely available, and emergency rooms are equipped to handle a range of medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is recommended to visit a private hospital, which may have more English-speaking staff and a wider range of medical services. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Lithuania include the Vilnius University Hospital and the Kaunas Clinic.\n\nIt is worth noting that medical emergency services in Lithuania are generally of high quality, with well-trained medical staff and modern equipment. However, it is still important to have health insurance, as medical bills can quickly add up, even in emergency situations. Additionally, some private hospitals may have agreements with international insurance companies, making it easier for foreigners to access medical care and receive reimbursement for medical expenses.",
