[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Lithuania is situated in **Northern Europe**, bordering the **Baltic Sea** to the west. It is one of the three **Baltic States**, along with Latvia and Estonia. The country shares borders with four countries: Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to the southwest. Lithuania's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between East and West.

The country's geography is characterized by a mix of low-lying plains, hills, and forests. The **Nemunas River**, which flows through the city of Kaunas, is the longest river in Lithuania and plays a significant role in the country's ecosystem. The **Curonian Lagoon**, a shallow body of water separated from the Baltic Sea by a narrow strip of land, is another notable geographical feature. Lithuania's coastline is relatively short, but it offers a unique combination of sandy beaches, dunes, and scenic views of the Baltic Sea.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Lithuania's terrain is generally flat, with many **lakes**, **rivers**, and **wetlands** scattered throughout the country. The landscape is dominated by **forests**, which cover about 30% of the land area. The ** Žemaitija National Park**, located in western Lithuania, is a protected area known for its diverse flora and fauna. The park features a mix of forests, bogs, and lakes, and is home to many species of birds, including the **white-tailed eagle** and the **black stork**.

The country's highest point, **Aukštojas Hill**, is located in the eastern part of Lithuania and reaches an elevation of 294 meters. The surrounding landscape is characterized by rolling hills, **meadows**, and **woodlands**. Lithuania's **coastal region** is marked by a scenic stretch of sandy beaches, dunes, and cliffs, with the **Curonian Spit** being a notable example. The spit, a narrow strip of land that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea, is a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Lithuania's **geological history** is complex, with the country's terrain shaped by the movement of glaciers during the last ice age. The resulting landscape features a mix of **glacial deposits**, **moraines**, and **drumlin fields**. The country's **soil** is generally fertile, making it suitable for **agriculture**.
