[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Lithuania's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all citizens are covered by the state-funded health insurance system. The system is primarily funded through payroll taxes and government subsidies. Public healthcare services are generally of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped hospitals and a wider range of specialized services. Private healthcare services are also available, and many locals and expats opt for private insurance to supplement their public coverage.

The public healthcare system in Lithuania is managed by the National Health Insurance Fund, which oversees the financing and provision of healthcare services. Patients have the right to choose their healthcare provider, and many public hospitals and clinics have contracts with the National Health Insurance Fund to provide services to insured patients. In addition to public healthcare services, there are also many private hospitals and clinics in Lithuania, which offer a range of specialized services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, and rehabilitation therapy.

Despite the overall quality of the healthcare system, there may be some challenges in accessing specialized care, particularly in rural areas. Waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and some medical equipment and supplies may be in short supply. However, the Lithuanian government has been working to improve the healthcare system, with a focus on increasing funding, modernizing equipment, and improving the training of medical professionals.
