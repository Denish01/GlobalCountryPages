  "content": "The cost of education in Lithuania varies depending on the type of institution and the student's residency status, with public education generally being free or subsidized for local students, while private and international schools charge tuition fees ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 4.2% (2022)\nLiteracy Rate: 99.8%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 10 months\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nLithuania's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the former being generally considered of high quality and free or subsidized for local students. The language of instruction is Lithuanian, although some schools may offer classes in English or other languages. Compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and upper secondary education. International schools are available in major cities, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the British GCSE and A-levels.\n\nThe quality of public education in Lithuania is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Private schools, on the other hand, may offer more flexible curricula and smaller class sizes, but can be expensive. International schools cater to expat families and offer a range of curricula, but can be even more expensive than private schools. Despite the differences in cost, all types of schools in Lithuania are subject to the same national curriculum and standards, ensuring that students receive a high-quality education regardless of the type of institution they attend.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, but may have large class sizes |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Smaller class sizes, more flexible curriculum |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Strong emphasis on STEM subjects |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | More extracurricular activities, better facilities |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | IB, GCSE, or A-level curriculum, small class sizes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $0-$1,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Low tuition fees for local students, but may have limited English courses |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | More flexible curriculum, smaller class sizes |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$3,000 | $4,000-$8,000 | Vilnius University, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Lithuania |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Limited availability, especially in rural areas |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Popular among students preparing for exams or needing extra help |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Lithuanian language courses for foreigners, or English language courses for locals |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, such as textbooks, notebooks, and pens |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for some private and international schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats are international schools, which offer a range of curricula and small class sizes.\n- Scholarships are available for local and international students, but may be limited and competitive.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular, especially for language courses and professional development.\n- Education quality in Lithuania is generally considered to be high, especially in STEM subjects.\n- Expats may find that the language of instruction is a barrier, especially in public schools.\n- **Lithuanian language skills** are essential for navigating everyday life and accessing education and employment opportunities.",
