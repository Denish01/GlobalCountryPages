[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Lithuania's housing market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a growing demand for modern apartments and houses. The rental market is relatively balanced, with a wide range of options available for tenants. Typical lease terms in Lithuania are one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and tenants can expect to receive a written lease agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the tenancy. Compared to its regional neighbors, Lithuania's housing costs are generally lower than those in Latvia and Poland, but higher than those in Belarus and Russia.

The Lithuanian government has implemented various initiatives to support the development of the housing market, including programs to encourage the construction of new apartments and houses. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to protect tenants' rights and regulate the rental market. As a result, the housing market in Lithuania is relatively stable and secure, with a wide range of options available for tenants. However, it's worth noting that the housing market can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Vilnius and Kaunas tend to have higher prices than smaller towns and rural areas.
