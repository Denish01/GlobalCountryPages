The country's infrastructure development level is considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on modernization and integration with European standards. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with cities like Vilnius and Kaunas having more developed infrastructure than rural regions. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this gap, including investments in rural road networks and broadband expansion.\n\nThe country's infrastructure has also been influenced by its strategic location between Europe and the East, making it an important transit hub for trade and commerce. Lithuania has been actively working to develop its transportation corridors, including the Via Baltica highway and the Rail Baltica project, which aim to improve connections with neighboring countries and facilitate the movement of goods and people. These initiatives have not only enhanced Lithuania's infrastructure but also contributed to the country's economic growth and integration into the European Union.\n\nIn recent years, Lithuania has also prioritized the development of its energy and telecommunications sectors, with a focus on increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources, and expanding access to high-speed internet. These efforts have contributed to the country's overall infrastructure development, making it an attractive destination for businesses and investors.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 84,000 km | Good | Well-maintained with modern highways, including the Via Baltica |\n| Railways | 1,767 km | Moderate | Electrified rail lines, with ongoing modernization efforts |\n| Airports | 3 international, 2 domestic | Good | Major airports in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Palanga |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | Ports in Klaipeda and Butinge, with cargo handling facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Lithuania's power generation is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a significant share of **natural gas** and **oil**.\n- The country has made progress in increasing its **renewable energy** capacity, with a focus on **wind** and **biomass**.\n- The electricity grid is considered to be reliable, with minimal **outages** and a high level of **energy efficiency**.\n- Lithuania is also exploring the potential of **nuclear energy**, with plans to develop a new nuclear power plant.\n- The government has set ambitious targets to increase the share of **renewable energy** in the energy mix, aiming to reach 45% of total energy consumption by 2030.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is considered to be safe to drink, with modern water treatment facilities and regular quality monitoring.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is generally good, with many households having access to piped water or wells.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **wastewater management**, including the construction of new treatment plants and the upgrade of existing infrastructure.\n- Lithuania has also made progress in reducing **water pollution**, with efforts to reduce industrial and agricultural waste.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with all major operators offering **4G** and **5G** services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in many urban areas, with ongoing expansion efforts to cover rural regions.\n- The country has a well-developed **postal service**, with a wide range of services and a large network of post offices.\n- **Internet penetration** is high, with over 85% of the population having access to the internet.\n- Lithuania has also invested in the development of **digital infrastructure**, including data centers and cloud computing services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Rail Baltica** project aims to develop a high-speed rail corridor connecting Lithuania to other European countries.\n- The **Via Baltica** highway project will upgrade the country's road network, improving connections with neighboring countries.\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote **renewable energy** development, including wind and biomass projects.\n- Lithuania is also investing in the development of its **ports**, including the expansion of the Klaipeda port and the construction of a new terminal.\n- The country has also received funding from the European Union to support the development of its **transportation corridors** and **energy infrastructure**.",
