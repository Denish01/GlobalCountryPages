[SECTION] Overview: Finland vs Russia [/SECTION]
Finland and Russia are two neighboring countries with distinct economic contexts. Finland is a high-income economy with a strong focus on technology, innovation, and social welfare, whereas Russia is a mixed economy with a significant dependence on oil and gas exports. The cost of living in Finland is generally higher due to its high standard of living, strong social safety net, and limited natural resources. In contrast, Russia has a more variable cost of living, with prices differing significantly depending on the region and city. Overall, Finland is around 20-30% more expensive than Russia, with the biggest differences in housing, food, and transportation costs.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Finland's high GDP per capita and low inflation rate contribute to its high cost of living, while Russia's lower GDP per capita and higher inflation rate result in a more affordable cost of living. However, it's essential to note that the cost of living can vary significantly within each country, depending on factors such as location, lifestyle, and personal preferences. For example, living in Helsinki, the capital city of Finland, can be significantly more expensive than living in other parts of the country. Similarly, living in Moscow, the capital city of Russia, can be more expensive than living in other parts of the country.
