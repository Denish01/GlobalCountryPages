The system is primarily funded through taxes and government subsidies, with some user fees for certain services. The public healthcare system is divided into two main sectors: primary healthcare, which provides basic medical care and preventive services, and specialized medical care, which includes hospital care and specialized treatments. The quality of care in Finland is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. However, there can be some differences in access to care between urban and rural areas, with longer waiting times and fewer specialized services available in rural areas.\n\nThe public healthcare system is the primary provider of medical care in Finland, but there are also some private healthcare providers, including private hospitals and clinics. These private providers often offer specialized services and shorter waiting times, but they can be more expensive than public services. Despite the high quality of care, Finland's healthcare system has faced some challenges in recent years, including an aging population and a shortage of medical professionals in certain specialties.\n\nFinland's healthcare system is also known for its emphasis on preventive care and public health programs, with a strong focus on health promotion and disease prevention. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles and reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. These initiatives include public education campaigns, screening programs, and community-based health services.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Helsinki University Hospital | Helsinki | Public | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Töölö Hospital | Helsinki | Public | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Turku University Hospital | Turku | Public | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Oulu University Hospital | Oulu | Public | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Mehiläinen Hospital | Helsinki | Private | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Dextra Hospital | Espoo | Private | General, specialized | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Public Health Insurance**: All Finnish citizens are entitled to public health insurance, which covers a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital care, and prescriptions.\n- **Private Health Insurance**: Private health insurance is available for those who want to supplement their public health insurance or access private healthcare services.\n- **Expatriate Insurance**: Expatriates living in Finland can purchase private health insurance that covers them for medical care in Finland and other countries.\n- **Student Insurance**: Students from non-EU countries may need to purchase private health insurance to cover their medical care while studying in Finland.\n- **Travel Insurance**: Visitors to Finland can purchase travel insurance that covers them for medical emergencies and other unexpected expenses.\n- **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)**: Citizens of EU countries can use their EHIC to access medical care in Finland, but they may need to pay some user fees.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacy Access**: Pharmacies are widely available in Finland, with many locations in urban and rural areas.\n- **Prescription Requirements**: Many medications require a prescription from a doctor, but some over-the-counter medications are available without a prescription.\n- **Common Brands**: Many international pharmaceutical companies have a presence in Finland, and a wide range of medications are available.\n- **Costs**: Medications can be expensive in Finland, but many are subsidized by the public healthcare system.\n- **Online Pharmacies**: Online pharmacies are available, but they must be licensed by the Finnish authorities to operate in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required Vaccinations**: There are no specific vaccinations required for travel to Finland, but it is recommended that travelers are up to date on all routine vaccinations.\n- **Recommended Vaccinations**: Travelers may want to consider vaccinations against hepatitis A and B, as well as tick-borne encephalitis.\n- **Endemic Diseases**: Finland has a low risk of infectious diseases, but there can be outbreaks of influenza and other respiratory illnesses during the winter months.\n- **Water Safety**: Tap water is safe to drink in Finland, and the country has a high standard of water quality.\n- **Food Safety**: Food safety is also high in Finland, with strict regulations on food handling and preparation.\n- **Tick-Borne Illnesses**: Ticks can be found in some areas of Finland, particularly in the summer months, and can transmit diseases such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular Procedures**: Finland is known for its high-quality medical care, and some medical tourists come to the country for procedures such as orthopedic surgery and cancer treatment.\n- **Accredited Hospitals**: Many Finnish hospitals are accredited by international organizations, such as the Joint Commission International.\n- **Cost Savings**: Medical care in Finland can be expensive, but some medical tourists may find that they can save money by coming to the country for certain procedures.\n- **Language**: English is widely spoken in Finland, making it easy for medical tourists to communicate with medical professionals.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency Number**: In the event of a medical emergency, call 112, which is the emergency number in Finland.\n- **Ambulance Reliability**: Ambulances are widely available and reliable in Finland, with a high standard of emergency medical care.\n- **Nearest Hospitals**: In the event of a medical emergency, it is best to go to the nearest hospital, which can provide emergency medical care.\n- **Insurance Claims**: If you have private health insurance, you may need to submit a claim to your insurance company after receiving medical care in Finland.\n- **Language**: Medical professionals in Finland often speak English, but it is still a good idea to learn some basic Finnish phrases, such as \"apu\" (help) and \"sairaala\" (hospital).",
