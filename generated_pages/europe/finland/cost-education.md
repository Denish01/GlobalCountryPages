[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Finland's education system is highly regarded for its quality and emphasis on equity, with both public and private schools offering high-quality education. The language of instruction is primarily Finnish, but Swedish is also widely used, and many schools offer English as a second language. Compulsory education in Finland lasts for 9 years, starting at the age of 7, and is divided into primary and secondary education. Public schools are free for all students, including international students, and are generally considered to be of high quality. Private schools, on the other hand, are less common and may have varying tuition fees.

The Finnish education system is known for its emphasis on student-centered learning, flexibility, and autonomy, which allows students to take ownership of their learning process. International schools are also available in Finland, particularly in larger cities like Helsinki, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). These schools cater to the needs of expat families and international students, providing a familiar curriculum and teaching style.
