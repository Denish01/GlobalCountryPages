[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Finland's housing market is characterized by a high demand for rental apartments, particularly in the city centers of Helsinki, Espoo, and Vantaa. The typical lease term for rental apartments is 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights in Finland are well-protected, with the law favoring the tenant in cases of disputes. Compared to its regional neighbors, Finland's housing costs are higher than those in Sweden and Norway, but lower than those in Denmark. The country's strong economy and high standard of living contribute to the relatively high housing costs.

The rental market in Finland is relatively stable, with a low vacancy rate and a high demand for apartments. This has led to an increase in rental prices, particularly in the city centers. However, the government has implemented measures to control rent increases and protect tenants' rights. For example, the **Rent Control Act** regulates the maximum rent increase allowed per year, and the **Tenant Protection Act** provides tenants with protection against unfair eviction and rent increases.
