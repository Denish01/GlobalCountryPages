The country's population growth rate is approximately 0.4%, which is lower than the European average. The majority of the population, around 85.5%, lives in urban areas, with the capital city Helsinki being the most populous. Urbanization has been a significant trend in Finland, with many people moving from rural areas to cities for better job opportunities and higher standards of living. Migration patterns have also played a crucial role in shaping Finland's population, with a significant number of immigrants arriving from other European countries, as well as from outside of Europe.\n\nFinland's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to a combination of natural increase and net migration. The country's aging population is a significant concern, with the median age being around 42.7 years. This has implications for the labor market, healthcare, and social security systems. To address these challenges, the Finnish government has implemented policies aimed at increasing fertility rates, encouraging immigration, and promoting active aging.\n\nThe population of Finland is also characterized by a high level of education, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This has contributed to the country's high standard of living, innovative economy, and excellent healthcare system. Overall, Finland's population is known for its high quality of life, with a strong focus on social welfare, equality, and environmental sustainability.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Finns | 91.5% | Throughout the country | Indigenous people of Finland |\n| Swedes | 5.5% | Coastal areas, particularly in the west and southwest | Swedish-speaking minority |\n| Sami | 0.1% | Lapland | Indigenous people of the Arctic region |\n| Russians | 1.1% | Throughout the country, particularly in urban areas | Immigrant community |\n| Estonians | 0.5% | Throughout the country, particularly in urban areas | Immigrant community |\n| Somalis | 0.2% | Urban areas, particularly in Helsinki | Refugee community |\n| Kurds | 0.1% | Urban areas, particularly in Helsinki | Refugee community |\n[/TABLE]\nFinland is a multicultural society, with a diverse range of ethnic groups.
