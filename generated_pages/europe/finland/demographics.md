Finland's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but it has been steadily growing over the years. The country's population growth rate is approximately 0.4%, which is lower than the European average. The majority of the population, around 85.5%, lives in urban areas, with the capital city Helsinki being the most populous.

Migration patterns have also played a crucial role in shaping Finland's population, with a significant number of immigrants arriving from other European countries, as well as from outside of Europe.

Finland's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to a combination of natural increase and net migration. The country's aging population is a significant concern, with the median age being around 42.7 years. This has implications for the labor market, healthcare, and social security systems. To address these challenges, the Finnish government has implemented policies aimed at increasing fertility rates, encouraging immigration, and promoting active aging.

This has contributed to the country's high standard of living, innovative economy, and excellent healthcare system.
