[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Finland's linguistic landscape is characterized by the dominance of Finnish, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population, and Swedish, which is spoken by around 5.5% of the population, primarily in coastal areas. There are also several regional dialects, including Savo, Ostrobothnian, and Tavastian, each with its unique characteristics and vocabulary. Additionally, there are several minority languages, including Sami, Romani, and Sign Language, which are recognized and protected by the Finnish government. English is widely understood in Finland, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry, making it relatively easy for tourists to communicate and navigate the country.

The widespread use of English in Finland is largely due to the country's education system, which emphasizes language learning from an early age. As a result, many Finns are proficient in multiple languages, including English, Swedish, and other European languages. This has contributed to Finland's high level of English proficiency, making it an attractive destination for international tourists and business travelers.

Finland's language policy is designed to promote the use of both Finnish and Swedish, as well as to protect the rights of minority language speakers. The country has a long tradition of bilingualism, and many Finns speak both Finnish and Swedish fluently. This has contributed to a unique cultural landscape, with both languages playing an important role in Finnish identity and society.
