The airport is located about 17 kilometers from the city center and offers direct flights to numerous destinations in Europe, Asia, and North America. You can also enter Finland by land or sea, with several border crossings from neighboring countries such as Sweden, Norway, and Russia. The most common overland entry points are from Sweden via the Torne Valley and from Russia via the southeastern border. Additionally, Finland has several ferry connections from Estonia and Sweden, making it a popular destination for those traveling by car or bus.

For those traveling from further afield, Helsinki-Vantaa Airport is a major hub for Finnair, the national carrier, which offers direct flights to many international destinations. Other airlines, such as SAS and Norwegian, also operate flights to Helsinki from various European cities. If you're planning to visit Finland from outside of Europe, you may need to connect through a major European hub such as Amsterdam, London, or Frankfurt. Alternatively, you can take a ferry or a cruise from neighboring countries, which can be a scenic and relaxing way to arrive in Finland.

Finland has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities. The main domestic airlines are Finnair, Norwegian, and SAS, which offer flights to destinations such as Oulu, Rovaniemi, and Kuopio. You can book domestic flights online through the airlines' websites or through a travel agent. Approximate costs for domestic flights vary depending on the route and time of year, but you can expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be quite expensive, especially during peak season, so it's a good idea to book in advance to get the best deals.
