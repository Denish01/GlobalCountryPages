  "content": "In Finland, healthcare costs are generally high, but the country's universal healthcare system ensures that all residents have access to quality medical care, with costs ranging from $50 to $500 for a doctor's visit, depending on whether you opt for public or private services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $5,515 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 14.1% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Public\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nFinland's public healthcare system is of high quality and widely available, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally less expensive than private healthcare, but may involve longer wait times for non-essential procedures. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of medical care, with most services covered by the government. For foreigners, private health insurance is often required, especially for those who are not employed or studying in Finland. However, some foreigners may be eligible for public healthcare services, depending on their residence status and employment situation. \n\nThe Finnish healthcare system is primarily funded through taxes and mandatory health insurance, which covers a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. In addition to the public healthcare system, there are also private healthcare providers in Finland, which offer a range of services, including specialized medical care and elective procedures. These private providers often have shorter wait times and more flexible scheduling than public providers, but may be more expensive.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | Public clinics are widely available, while private clinics may offer more flexible scheduling |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$250 | Public specialist care may require a referral from a GP |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public dental care is generally less expensive, but may have longer wait times |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public eye exams are widely available, but private clinics may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $20-$50 | Public labs are widely available, but private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals have emergency rooms, while private hospitals may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Public hospitals are generally less expensive, but may have longer wait times |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Public hospitals offer a range of surgical services, while private hospitals may offer more specialized care |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Public hospitals have maternity wards, while private hospitals may offer more comprehensive prenatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public hospitals have MRI machines, while private hospitals may offer faster scheduling |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals have X-ray machines, while private hospitals may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Private healthcare services, including specialist care and elective procedures |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Comprehensive medical coverage, including emergency care and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally less expensive in Finland than in many other countries, with prices starting at around $5-$10 for a basic prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices starting at around $5-$10.\n- Pharmacy services are widely available, with many pharmacies open late or 24 hours.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a doctor, while others are available over-the-counter.\n- Pharmacists in Finland are highly trained and can provide advice on medication use and interactions.\n- Medication prices may vary depending on the city and region, with prices tend to be higher in Helsinki than in other parts of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial 112 to reach emergency services. Ambulances are widely available and can be summoned quickly in emergency situations. For foreigners, it's a good idea to have a basic understanding of Finnish, as not all emergency responders may speak English. However, many hospitals and emergency services have English-speaking staff, and some may also offer interpretation services. The best hospitals for foreigners in Finland are generally those that are affiliated with international insurance providers or that have experience treating foreign patients. Some of the top hospitals in Finland include the Helsinki University Hospital and the Turku University Hospital, both of which offer a range of medical services and have English-speaking staff. \n\nIt's also a good idea to have a plan in place for emergency care, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a list of important phone numbers, such as your embassy and insurance provider. In addition, many foreigners in Finland choose to purchase private health insurance, which can provide additional coverage and peace of mind in emergency situations. By being prepared and having a plan in place, foreigners in Finland can ensure that they receive the medical care they need in emergency situations.",
