[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Finnish property market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by a strong economy, low interest rates, and a shortage of housing in urban areas. The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a focus on energy efficiency and sustainability. Urban areas, particularly Helsinki, have seen significant price increases, while rural areas have remained relatively stable. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available and competitive pricing. However, the market is expected to slow down in the coming years due to rising interest rates and increased construction costs.

The price trajectory in Finland has been steadily increasing, with an average annual growth rate of 3-4%. This growth is driven by the demand for housing in urban areas, particularly among young professionals and families. The urban-rural divide is also a significant factor, with urban areas experiencing higher price growth than rural areas. The government has implemented measures to control price growth, such as increasing the supply of housing and introducing rent controls.

The Finnish property market is also characterized by a strong focus on **sustainability** and **energy efficiency**. Many new developments are designed with these principles in mind, incorporating features such as solar panels, green roofs, and advanced insulation. This focus on sustainability is driven by government policies and incentives, as well as consumer demand for environmentally friendly properties.
