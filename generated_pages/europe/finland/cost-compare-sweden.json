  "content": "Finland is generally cheaper than Sweden, with an overall cost of living difference of around 10-15%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nFinland GDP per Capita (PPP): 49,850\nSweden GDP per Capita (PPP): 52,477\nFinland Inflation Rate: 1.2%\nSweden Inflation Rate: 1.8%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Finland\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Finland vs Sweden [/SECTION]\nFinland and Sweden are both Nordic countries with high standards of living, but they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Finland has a smaller economy and a lower GDP per capita compared to Sweden, which contributes to its lower cost of living. The inflation rate in Finland is also lower than in Sweden, which means that prices for goods and services are increasing at a slower pace. Overall, Finland is a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees who want to experience the Nordic lifestyle without breaking the bank.\n\nThe cost of living in Finland and Sweden can vary significantly depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences. However, in general, Finland is cheaper than Sweden, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. For example, a one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Helsinki costs around $1,200 per month, while a similar apartment in Stockholm costs around $1,500 per month. Similarly, a meal at a mid-range restaurant in Finland costs around $15 per person, while in Sweden it costs around $20 per person. These price differences can add up over time, making Finland a more attractive option for those on a budget.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Finland (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,200 | 1,500 | 20% more expensive in Sweden |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 800 | 1,000 | 20% more expensive in Sweden |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 2,000 | 2,500 | 20% more expensive in Sweden |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Finland (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 20 | 25% more expensive in Sweden |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 600 | 17% more expensive in Sweden |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 6 | 17% more expensive in Sweden |\n| Coffee | 3 | 4 | 25% more expensive in Sweden |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Finland (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 60 | 80 | 25% more expensive in Sweden |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Sweden |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.50 | 1.70 | 11% more expensive in Sweden |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Finland (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 120 | 17% more expensive in Sweden |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive in Sweden |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Sweden |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Finland (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,800 | 17% less expensive in Finland |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 3,000 | 17% less expensive in Finland |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 4,800 | 17% less expensive in Finland |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Finland is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices 20% lower than in Sweden\n- Food and dining, with prices 17-25% lower than in Sweden\n- Transportation, with prices 11-25% lower than in Sweden\n- Utilities and internet, with prices 17-25% lower than in Sweden\n- **Sweden is cheaper for:**\n- Healthcare, with a more comprehensive and subsidized system\n- Education, with free tuition for higher education\n- Childcare, with subsidized and high-quality options\n- Recreation, with a wider range of cultural and outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFinland and Sweden are both excellent choices for expats, students, and retirees, but they cater to different lifestyles and priorities.
