[SECTION] Overview: Finland vs Norway [/SECTION]
Finland and Norway are two neighboring countries in Northern Europe, known for their high standard of living, stunning natural beauty, and unique cultural heritage. However, when it comes to the cost of living, Finland is generally considered to be more affordable than Norway. The main reason for this is the difference in GDP per capita, with Norway having a significantly higher GDP per capita due to its large oil reserves. As a result, Norway has a higher cost of living, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being significantly higher than in Finland. On the other hand, Finland has a more balanced economy, with a strong focus on technology, manufacturing, and services, which helps to keep prices lower.

In terms of economic context, both countries have a high standard of living and a strong social safety net, with low poverty rates and high levels of education. However, Norway's economy is more dependent on oil exports, which can make it more vulnerable to fluctuations in the global oil market. Finland, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on innovation and technology. Overall, Finland is a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, while Norway is better suited for those with higher incomes or those who are willing to pay a premium for a high standard of living.
