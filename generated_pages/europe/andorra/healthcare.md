[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Andorra's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all residents and visitors have access to medical care. The system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and private insurance. The quality of care in Andorra is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there may be some limitations in terms of specialized care, particularly in rural areas. Urban areas, such as Andorra la Vella, tend to have better access to medical facilities and specialized care. The country's small size and proximity to France and Spain also make it easy to access medical care in neighboring countries if needed.

The public healthcare system in Andorra is generally considered to be of high quality, with a wide range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and diagnostic tests. Private healthcare options are also available, and many residents and visitors choose to purchase private insurance to supplement the public system. This can provide access to additional services, such as private hospital rooms and specialized care.

Overall, Andorra's healthcare system is well-regarded and provides high-quality medical care to its residents and visitors. However, it is still important for visitors to have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high, even in the public system.
