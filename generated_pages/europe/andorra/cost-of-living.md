[SECTION] How Expensive Is Andorra? [/SECTION]
Andorra is a small, independent principality located in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain. The cost of living in Andorra is generally moderate, with prices comparable to those in other European countries. However, due to its unique location and limited size, some goods and services may be more expensive than in neighboring countries. Overall, Andorra offers a good balance between quality of life and affordability, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike. Compared to other European countries, Andorra's cost of living is lower than in Western European countries like Switzerland or Norway, but higher than in Eastern European countries like Poland or Hungary.

Andorra's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, with millions of visitors flocking to the country each year to take advantage of its duty-free shopping and outdoor recreation opportunities. As a result, prices for accommodations, food, and activities can be higher during peak season (December to April and June to August). However, visitors can still find affordable options and enjoy a high quality of life in Andorra. The country's stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and modern amenities make it an excellent choice for those looking to experience the best of Europe without breaking the bank.
