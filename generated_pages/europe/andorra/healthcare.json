  "content": "Andorra has a well-regarded healthcare system that provides high-quality medical care to its residents and visitors, with a strong network of hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: 4/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Excellent\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nAndorra's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all residents and visitors have access to medical care. The system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and private insurance. The quality of care in Andorra is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there may be some limitations in terms of specialized care, particularly in rural areas. Urban areas, such as Andorra la Vella, tend to have better access to medical facilities and specialized care. The country's small size and proximity to France and Spain also make it easy to access medical care in neighboring countries if needed.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Andorra is generally considered to be of high quality, with a wide range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and diagnostic tests. Private healthcare options are also available, and many residents and visitors choose to purchase private insurance to supplement the public system. This can provide access to additional services, such as private hospital rooms and specialized care.\n\nOverall, Andorra's healthcare system is well-regarded and provides high-quality medical care to its residents and visitors. However, it is still important for visitors to have some form of health insurance, as medical costs can be high, even in the public system.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital Nostra Senyora de Meritxell | Andorra la Vella | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Yes |\n| Clinica Dental Andorra | Andorra la Vella | Private | Dentistry | Yes |\n| Centre Medic d'Andorra | Escaldes-Engordany | Private | General medicine, specialized care | Yes |\n| Hospital de Sant Joan de Déu | Encamp | Public | General medicine, emergency care | Limited |\n| Clinica Quiron Andorra | Andorra la Vella | Private | Specialized care, surgery | Yes |\n| Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace | Encamp | Private | General medicine, emergency care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors to Andorra, as it can provide access to additional medical services and help cover costs.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including Andorra's public healthcare system, which provides coverage for residents and visitors.\n- **Expats** living in Andorra may be required to purchase private health insurance, depending on their visa status.\n- **Costs** for health insurance in Andorra can vary widely, depending on the type of coverage and the individual's circumstances.\n- **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)** holders may be able to access medical care in Andorra at reduced costs.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors to Andorra, as it can provide coverage for unexpected medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Andorra, with many pharmacies located throughout the country.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but many common medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are widely available, including international brands.\n- **Costs** for medications in Andorra can vary, but many medications are subsidized by the government.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies open late and on weekends.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Andorra include routine vaccinations, such as MMR and DTaP.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis A and B, and rabies.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Andorra include influenza and respiratory infections.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Andorra, with safe drinking water available throughout the country.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, with a low risk of foodborne illness.\n- **Altitude sickness** can be a risk in Andorra, particularly in the mountains, where the altitude can be high.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Andorra include cosmetic surgery and dental care.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Andorra include the Hospital Nostra Senyora de Meritxell and the Clinica Quiron Andorra.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists in Andorra, particularly for procedures such as cosmetic surgery.\n- **Language** is not typically a barrier for medical tourists in Andorra, as many medical professionals speak English.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** in Andorra is 112, which can be used to access emergency medical services.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good in Andorra, with modern ambulances and well-trained paramedics.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found in Andorra la Vella and other urban areas, with emergency services available 24/7.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, but many insurance providers have representatives in Andorra who can assist with the claims process.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, particularly for serious injuries or illnesses, and can be arranged through insurance providers or private companies.",
