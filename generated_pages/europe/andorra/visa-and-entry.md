# Andorra Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Andorra before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Andorra has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa. The country is not a member of the European Union (EU), but it has a special relationship with the EU, which allows for a relatively liberal visa policy. Citizens of over 100 countries, including the US, Canada, and Australia, can enter Andorra visa-free for tourism and business purposes. However, citizens of other countries, including India and China, require a visa to enter Andorra.

Andorra's visa policy is designed to promote tourism and economic development, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. The country has a relatively simple visa application process, and most visas are issued within a few days. However, it's essential to check the current visa requirements before traveling to Andorra, as visa rules can change frequently.
