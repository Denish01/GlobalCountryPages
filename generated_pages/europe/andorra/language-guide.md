[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Andorra's linguistic landscape is characterized by the prevalence of Catalan, the country's official language, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. However, due to the country's strategic location between France and Spain, many Andorrans are bilingual or trilingual, speaking Spanish, French, and Portuguese in addition to Catalan. The regional dialects of Catalan spoken in Andorra are closely related to those spoken in neighboring Catalonia, Spain, and the language has been recognized as an official language since 1993. English is not as widely spoken as in other European countries, but it is still understood by many in the service industry, particularly in tourist areas.

Despite the widespread use of Catalan, there are some minority languages spoken in Andorra, including Spanish, French, and Portuguese, which are spoken by immigrants and foreigners who have made the country their home. However, Catalan remains the dominant language and is used in all official contexts, including government, education, and media. Visitors who make an effort to speak some Catalan will be appreciated by the locals, and it can go a long way in enhancing their overall experience in the country.

The level of English proficiency in Andorra is moderate, with many younger people and those in the tourism industry speaking some English. However, it is still a good idea for visitors to learn some basic Catalan phrases to help them navigate the country and interact with the locals. English is more widely spoken in the capital city of Andorra la Vella, but it is less common in rural areas, where Catalan is the primary language spoken.
