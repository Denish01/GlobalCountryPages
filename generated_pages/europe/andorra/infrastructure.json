The country has invested heavily in recent years to improve its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, the expansion of its energy systems, and the development of its telecommunications networks. Despite its small size, Andorra has a relatively high level of urbanization, with the majority of its population living in the capital city of Andorra la Vella and its surrounding areas. However, there is still a noticeable gap between the infrastructure available in urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having limited access to certain services.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development has been driven in part by its growing tourism industry, which attracts millions of visitors each year. To accommodate this growth, the government has invested in a range of infrastructure projects, including the expansion of its road network and the development of new amenities such as hotels and restaurants. Andorra's unique location in the Pyrenees mountains also presents some challenges for infrastructure development, with steep terrain and harsh weather conditions requiring specialized engineering solutions.\n\nOverall, Andorra's infrastructure is well-suited to meet the needs of its population and visitors, with a strong focus on providing high-quality services and amenities. The country's small size and limited resources have required careful planning and management to ensure that its infrastructure is developed in a sustainable and efficient manner.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 269 km | Good | Well-maintained roads with limited traffic congestion |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network, but bus services connect to neighboring countries |\n| Airports | 1 international | Moderate | Limited flight options, but convenient access to major hubs |\n| Ports | none | - | Landlocked, but nearby ports in France and Spain provide access to sea trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Andorra's power generation is primarily based on **imported electricity** from France and Spain, with some limited local generation from **hydroelectric** and **solar power** sources.\n- The country's energy system is relatively reliable, with limited **power outages** and a strong focus on **energy efficiency**.\n- Andorra has set ambitious targets to increase its use of **renewable energy** sources, including solar and wind power, and has implemented a range of incentives to encourage investment in these areas.\n- The country's **energy infrastructure** is well-developed, with a modern and efficient grid that is capable of meeting the needs of its population and visitors.\n- Andorra is also exploring opportunities to develop its **geothermal energy** potential, which could provide a significant source of renewable energy in the future.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Andorra's **tap water** is safe to drink and of high quality, with a well-developed system for water treatment and distribution.\n- The country has a high level of **sanitation coverage**, with modern and efficient systems for wastewater treatment and disposal.\n- **Water access** is generally good, even in rural areas, with a network of pipes and storage tanks to ensure a reliable supply.\n- Andorra has implemented a range of measures to **conserve water** and reduce waste, including the use of efficient appliances and fixtures.\n- The country's **water infrastructure** is well-maintained, with regular upgrades and repairs to ensure that it remains in good condition.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Andorra has a **high level of mobile coverage**, with all major operators providing services in the country.\n- The country's **fiber-optic network** is well-developed, with fast and reliable **broadband** services available in most areas.\n- Andorra has implemented a range of initiatives to promote **digital inclusion**, including the development of public Wi-Fi networks and digital literacy programs.\n- The country's **postal services** are efficient and reliable, with a range of services available for sending and receiving mail and packages.\n- Andorra is also investing in the development of **5G networks**, which will provide even faster and more reliable mobile services in the future.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- Andorra is currently investing in a range of **transport infrastructure projects**, including the expansion of its road network and the development of new bus services.\n- The country is also implementing a range of **energy efficiency measures**, including the development of smart grids and the promotion of renewable energy sources.\n- Andorra has launched a **national broadband plan**, which aims to provide fast and reliable internet services to all areas of the country.\n- The country is also investing in the development of its **tourism infrastructure**, including the construction of new hotels and amenities.\n- Andorra has received funding from the **European Union** to support the development of its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the implementation of energy efficiency measures.",
