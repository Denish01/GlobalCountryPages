# Andorra History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Andorra is a complex and unique blend of medieval traditions, colonial influences, and modern developments that have shaped the country into the sovereign state it is today.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
Andorra's history dates back to the **ancient era**, with evidence of human presence in the region as far back as the **Neolithic period**. The country's strategic location in the Pyrenees Mountains made it an important stopover for traders and travelers between France and Spain. In the **Middle Ages**, Andorra was a **paréage**, a feudal territory jointly owned by two lords, the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix. This unique arrangement allowed Andorra to maintain its independence and develop a distinct culture. The country's **pre-colonial era** was marked by a series of agreements and treaties between the two co-princes, which helped to establish Andorra's borders and governance structure.

During the **colonial period**, Andorra was not directly colonized by any European power, but it was influenced by the **Spanish Empire** and the **French monarchy**. The country's location in the Pyrenees made it a crucial buffer zone between France and Spain, and it was often used as a negotiating chip in treaties between the two powers. In the **18th century**, Andorra's unique system of government was formalized, with the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix (later replaced by the French head of state) serving as co-princes. This system has continued to the present day, with the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France serving as Andorra's co-princes.

In the **modern era**, Andorra has undergone significant changes, including the adoption of a **constitution** in 1993 and the country's entry into the **United Nations** in 1993. Andorra has also become a popular **tourist destination**, with over 10 million visitors per year, and has developed a strong **economy** based on **finance**, **trade**, and **tourism**. The country has also made significant progress in terms of **democratization** and **human rights**, with the establishment of a **parliamentary system** and the protection of **individual freedoms**.
