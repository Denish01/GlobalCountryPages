[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Andorra's infrastructure is characterized by its high level of development, with a strong emphasis on providing modern and efficient services to its population. The country has invested heavily in recent years to improve its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, the expansion of its energy systems, and the development of its telecommunications networks. Despite its small size, Andorra has a relatively high level of urbanization, with the majority of its population living in the capital city of Andorra la Vella and its surrounding areas. However, there is still a noticeable gap between the infrastructure available in urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having limited access to certain services.

The country's infrastructure development has been driven in part by its growing tourism industry, which attracts millions of visitors each year. To accommodate this growth, the government has invested in a range of infrastructure projects, including the expansion of its road network and the development of new amenities such as hotels and restaurants. Andorra's unique location in the Pyrenees mountains also presents some challenges for infrastructure development, with steep terrain and harsh weather conditions requiring specialized engineering solutions.

Overall, Andorra's infrastructure is well-suited to meet the needs of its population and visitors, with a strong focus on providing high-quality services and amenities. The country's small size and limited resources have required careful planning and management to ensure that its infrastructure is developed in a sustainable and efficient manner.
