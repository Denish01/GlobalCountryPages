  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Andorra can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with the country's health expenditure per capita being $3,605 and out-of-pocket health spend being 11.2% of total health expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $3,605\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 11.2%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nAndorra has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is available to all residents, including foreigners who have obtained a residence permit. However, the public system can be slow and bureaucratic, and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. In contrast, the private healthcare system in Andorra is highly developed and offers a wide range of specialized services, often with shorter waiting times and more personalized attention. Many locals and foreigners alike choose to use private healthcare services, especially for elective procedures or specialized care.\n\nThe healthcare system in Andorra works differently for locals and foreigners. Locals are entitled to free or low-cost public healthcare, while foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket or have private health insurance to access public services. However, foreigners who have obtained a residence permit may be eligible for public healthcare services, and some employers may offer private health insurance as part of their employment package. It is highly recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance, either through their employer or privately, to cover any unexpected medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public prices vary by location, private prices vary by doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Public prices vary by specialty, private prices vary by doctor |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Public prices vary by location, private prices vary by dentist |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public prices vary by location, private prices vary by optometrist |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Public prices vary by location, private prices vary by lab |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public prices vary by hospital, private prices vary by hospital |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Public prices vary by hospital, private prices vary by hospital |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Public prices vary by procedure, private prices vary by surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Public prices vary by hospital, private prices vary by obstetrician |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public prices vary by location, private prices vary by lab |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Public prices vary by location, private prices vary by lab |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and specialist consultations |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global healthcare coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary by pharmacy and location, but are generally lower than in other European countries.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available in pharmacies and supermarkets.\n- Common medications like pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$20.\n- Prescription rules are strict, and many medications require a doctor's prescription.\n- Pharmacies are widely available, especially in Andorra la Vella.\n- Some medications may be cheaper in neighboring countries, such as Spain or France.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number 112, which will connect you to the local emergency services.
