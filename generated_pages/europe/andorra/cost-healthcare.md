[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Andorra has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is available to all residents, including foreigners who have obtained a residence permit. However, the public system can be slow and bureaucratic, and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. In contrast, the private healthcare system in Andorra is highly developed and offers a wide range of specialized services, often with shorter waiting times and more personalized attention. Many locals and foreigners alike choose to use private healthcare services, especially for elective procedures or specialized care.

The healthcare system in Andorra works differently for locals and foreigners. Locals are entitled to free or low-cost public healthcare, while foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket or have private health insurance to access public services. However, foreigners who have obtained a residence permit may be eligible for public healthcare services, and some employers may offer private health insurance as part of their employment package. It is highly recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance, either through their employer or privately, to cover any unexpected medical expenses.
