        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Andorra is a <strong>sovereign</strong> state located in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain. The country's unique history dates back to 778 when Charlemagne, the King of the Franks, granted the area to the Bishop of Urgell as a way to protect the region from the Moors. In 1278, the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix signed the <strong>Pareage</strong>, a treaty that established Andorra as a <strong>paréage</strong>, or a territory governed jointly by two co-princes. This unique system of government has been in place for over 700 years, with the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France serving as the co-princes of Andorra.</p>
        <p>The country gained <strong>independence</strong> from France and Spain in 1809, but it was not until 1993 that Andorra adopted its first <strong>constitution</strong>, which established the country as a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong>. The constitution also recognized the co-princes as the heads of state, but they have limited powers and are primarily symbolic figures. Andorra has been a member of the <strong>United Nations</strong> since 1993 and has been a member of the <strong>Council of Europe</strong> since 1994.</p>
        <p>Andorra's history has been shaped by its strategic location in the Pyrenees mountains, which has made it an important trade route between France and Spain. The country has also been influenced by the <strong>Catalan culture</strong>, which is reflected in its language, customs, and traditions. Andorra has a <strong>unique cultural identity</strong> that is distinct from its neighbors, despite being heavily influenced by French and Spanish cultures.</p>
        <p>Andorra's <strong>economic history</strong> has been marked by its reliance on <strong>agriculture</strong> and <strong>trade</strong>, but in recent years, the country has diversified its economy to include <strong>tourism</strong>, <strong>finance</strong>, and <strong>industry</strong>. The country has a <strong>high standard of living</strong>, with a strong economy and a high level of social welfare. Andorra has also been a popular destination for <strong>skiing</strong> and <strong>hiking</strong>, with its picturesque mountains and valleys attracting tourists from around the world.</p>
