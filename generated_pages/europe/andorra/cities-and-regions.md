[SECTION] How Andorra Is Divided [/SECTION]
Andorra is a small, sovereign state located in the Pyrenees mountains, divided into 7 parishes, each with its own local government and administrative structure. The parishes are Andorra la Vella, Canillo, Encamp, Escaldes-Engordany, La Massana, Ordino, and Sant Julià de Lòria. This division allows for a more localized approach to governance, taking into account the unique characteristics and needs of each parish.

The administrative structure of Andorra is based on a parliamentary democracy, with the General Council, or Consell General, serving as the country's unicameral legislature. The General Council is composed of 28 members, elected by the people of Andorra for a four-year term. The Head of Government, or Cap de Govern, is responsible for overseeing the executive branch of the government, while the two Co-Princes, the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France, serve as the country's heads of state.
