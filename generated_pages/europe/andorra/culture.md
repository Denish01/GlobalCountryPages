# Andorra Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Andorra's culture is deeply rooted in its history and geography, with the country nestled in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain. The official language, **Catalan**, is a key aspect of Andorran identity, and the country has a unique cultural heritage that reflects its strategic position between two major European powers. The ethnic makeup of Andorra is predominantly Catalan, with a strong sense of national pride and a distinct cultural identity that sets it apart from its neighbors. The country's small population and stunning natural beauty have also contributed to a strong sense of community and a deep connection to the land.

Andorra's cultural identity has been shaped by its history as a **parliamentary democracy** and a **constitutional diarchy**, with two co-princes, the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France, serving as heads of state. This unique system of government has contributed to a strong sense of independence and self-governance, and has allowed Andorra to maintain its cultural autonomy despite its small size. The country's strategic position has also made it an important center for trade and commerce, with a strong emphasis on tourism and outdoor activities such as skiing and hiking.

The cultural landscape of Andorra is also influenced by its **Romanesque heritage**, with numerous churches and buildings dating back to the Middle Ages. The country's stunning natural beauty, with its mountains, valleys, and rivers, has also inspired a strong tradition of **folk music and dance**, with many festivals and celebrations taking place throughout the year. Overall, Andorra's cultural identity is a unique blend of Catalan heritage, natural beauty, and a strong sense of national pride and independence.
