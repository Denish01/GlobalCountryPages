The country's limited geographic area and strict building regulations contribute to a relatively low supply of housing, which can drive up prices. Typical lease terms in Andorra range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with regulations governing issues such as rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, France and Spain, Andorra's housing costs are relatively high, reflecting the country's strong economy and high standard of living.\n\nThe rental market in Andorra is highly competitive, with many apartments and houses available for rent in the capital city and surrounding areas. However, prices can be steep, particularly in the city center, where demand is highest. To find affordable accommodation, renters may need to consider sharing an apartment or looking for properties outside the city center. It's also worth noting that Andorra has a relatively high cost of living, with prices for food, transportation, and other essentials comparable to those in Western Europe.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $900 - $1,400 | $600 - $1,000 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,200 - $1,800 | $800 - $1,400 | modern, fully equipped |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,800 - $2,800 | $1,200 - $2,200 | family size, comfortable |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500 - $4,000 | $1,800 - $3,200 | spacious, luxurious |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $4,000 - $6,000 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $2,500 - $4,000 | residential areas, family homes |\n| Rural | $1,500 - $2,500 | mountainous areas, traditional houses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Andorra la Vella**: the capital city offers a range of accommodation options, from modern apartments to historic houses, with prices ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 per month.\n- **Escaldes-Engordany**: a popular area for expats, with a range of amenities and services, and prices from $800 to $2,000 per month.\n- **Sant Julia de Loria**: a quieter area with a more local feel, prices from $600 to $1,500 per month.\n- **La Massana**: a picturesque area with a range of outdoor activities, prices from $800 to $2,000 per month.\n- **Ordino**: a scenic area with a range of accommodation options, prices from $600 to $1,500 per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Andorra [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to find the best deals on accommodation.\n- Consider working with a real estate agent to find a property that meets your needs and budget.\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market in Andorra can be highly competitive.\n- Make sure to read and understand the terms of your lease agreement before signing.\n- Check if utilities such as electricity, water, and internet are included in the rent, or if you will need to pay for them separately.\n- Furnished apartments are common in Andorra, but it's worth checking what is included in the rent and what you may need to provide yourself.\n- [CALLOUT] Be aware of scams and always work with reputable agents or landlords to avoid any potential issues.",
