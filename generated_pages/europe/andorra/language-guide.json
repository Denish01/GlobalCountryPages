  "content": "The official language of Andorra is Catalan, and while many locals speak multiple languages, including Spanish, French, and Portuguese, visitors can still get by with some basic Catalan phrases and a moderate understanding of English.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Catalan\nWidely Spoken: Spanish, French, Portuguese\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nAndorra's linguistic landscape is characterized by the prevalence of Catalan, the country's official language, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. However, due to the country's strategic location between France and Spain, many Andorrans are bilingual or trilingual, speaking Spanish, French, and Portuguese in addition to Catalan. The regional dialects of Catalan spoken in Andorra are closely related to those spoken in neighboring Catalonia, Spain, and the language has been recognized as an official language since 1993. English is not as widely spoken as in other European countries, but it is still understood by many in the service industry, particularly in tourist areas.\n\nDespite the widespread use of Catalan, there are some minority languages spoken in Andorra, including Spanish, French, and Portuguese, which are spoken by immigrants and foreigners who have made the country their home. However, Catalan remains the dominant language and is used in all official contexts, including government, education, and media. Visitors who make an effort to speak some Catalan will be appreciated by the locals, and it can go a long way in enhancing their overall experience in the country.\n\nThe level of English proficiency in Andorra is moderate, with many younger people and those in the tourism industry speaking some English. However, it is still a good idea for visitors to learn some basic Catalan phrases to help them navigate the country and interact with the locals. English is more widely spoken in the capital city of Andorra la Vella, but it is less common in rural areas, where Catalan is the primary language spoken.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola | OH-lah | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Gràcies | GRAH-see-es | formal |\n| Please | Si us plau | see oos PLOW | formal |\n| Yes / No | Sí / No | SEE / NOH | formal/informal |\n| Excuse me | Disculpa | dees-KOOL-pah | formal |\n| How much? | Quant costa? | KWAHN KOH-stah | formal |\n| Where is...? | On és...? | OHN EH-s | formal |\n| I don't understand | No entenc | noh ehn-TEHNK | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Parla anglès? | PAHR-lah ahn-GLEH-s | formal |\n| Help! | Auxili! | ah-oo-SEE-lee | formal |\n| Goodbye | Adéu | ah-DEH-oo | formal |\n| Sorry | Ho sento | oh SAHN-toh | formal |\n| How are you? | Com estàs? | kohm ehs-TAH-s | informal |\n| What's your name? | Com et dius? | kohm eht DEE-oos | informal |\n| I'm lost | Estic perdut | ehs-TEEK pehr-DOOT | formal |\n| Where is the bathroom? | On és el bany? | OHN EH-s ehl BAHN-y | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Un | oon |\n| 2 | Dos | dohs |\n| 3 | Tres | trays |\n| 4 | Quatre | KWAH-tray |\n| 5 | Cinc | SEENK |\n| 6 | Sis | sees |\n| 7 | Set | seht |\n| 8 | Vuit | BWEET |\n| 9 | Nou | noo |\n| 10 | Deu | DEH-oo |\n| 100 | Cent | saynt |\n| 1000 | Mil | meel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it's customary to use formal titles such as \"senyor\" or \"senyora\" until you're explicitly invited to use first names.\n- Andorrans tend to be formal and polite, so it's a good idea to use formal language and greetings, especially when addressing older people or those in positions of authority.\n- Physical touch is an important part of Andorran culture, and it's common for people to greet each other with a kiss on each cheek.\n- When dining at a restaurant, it's customary to wait for the host to invite you to sit down and to keep your hands visible on the table.\n- Avoid talking loudly or using aggressive body language, as this can be seen as rude or confrontational.\n- If you need help or directions, don't hesitate to ask a local, and be sure to thank them politely for their assistance.\n- When shopping, be prepared to haggle and negotiate prices, especially at markets or from street vendors.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The Google Translate app is a useful tool for translating Catalan phrases and sentences on the go.\n- A phrasebook or dictionary can be a helpful resource for learning basic Catalan phrases and vocabulary.\n- Many restaurants and shops in Andorra have English menus and signs, but it's still a good idea to learn some basic Catalan phrases to help you navigate.\n- Consider taking a language course or using online resources to learn more about the Catalan language and culture before your trip.\n- If you're having trouble communicating, don't be afraid to ask for help or to seek out a translator or interpreter.",
