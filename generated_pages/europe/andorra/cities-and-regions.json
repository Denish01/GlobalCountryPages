The parishes are Andorra la Vella, Canillo, Encamp, Escaldes-Engordany, La Massana, Ordino, and Sant Julià de Lòria. This division allows for a more localized approach to governance, taking into account the unique characteristics and needs of each parish.\n\nThe administrative structure of Andorra is based on a parliamentary democracy, with the General Council, or Consell General, serving as the country's unicameral legislature. The General Council is composed of 28 members, elected by the people of Andorra for a four-year term. The Head of Government, or Cap de Govern, is responsible for overseeing the executive branch of the government, while the two Co-Princes, the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France, serve as the country's heads of state.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Andorra la Vella** (0.02M)\nRole: capital, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic center, duty-free shopping, and modern amenities\nBest For: visitors looking for a mix of culture, history, and entertainment\n\n**Escaldes-Engordany** (0.014M)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its natural hot springs, historic architecture, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: those seeking relaxation, wellness, and cultural experiences\n\n**Encamp** (0.012M)\nRole: economic hub, ski resort\nKnown For: its stunning mountain scenery, ski slopes, and outdoor recreation opportunities\nBest For: skiers, hikers, and nature lovers\n\n**La Massana** (0.009M)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic village, museums, and traditional festivals\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and local traditions\n\n**Ordino** (0.005M)\nRole: cultural center, ski resort\nKnown For: its picturesque village, historic church, and ski slopes\nBest For: those seeking a peaceful, rural experience and outdoor activities\n\n**Canillo** (0.004M)\nRole: economic hub, ski resort\nKnown For: its stunning mountain scenery, ski slopes, and historic church\nBest For: skiers, hikers, and nature lovers\n\n**Sant Julià de Lòria** (0.008M)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic village, museums, and traditional festivals\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and local traditions\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Andorra la Vella | urban, commercial | shopping, dining, nightlife | Andorra la Vella |\n| Escaldes-Engordany | urban, cultural | hot springs, historic architecture | Escaldes-Engordany |\n| Encamp | mountainous, outdoor | skiing, hiking, nature | Encamp |\n| La Massana | rural, cultural | historic village, museums | La Massana |\n| Ordino | rural, outdoor | skiing, hiking, nature | Ordino |\n| Canillo | mountainous, outdoor | skiing, hiking, nature | Canillo |\n| Sant Julià de Lòria | rural, cultural | historic village, museums | Sant Julià de Lòria |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The parishes of Andorra la Vella and Escaldes-Engordany are more urbanized and commercial, with a focus on shopping and entertainment.\n- The parishes of Encamp, Ordino, and Canillo are more rural and mountainous, with a focus on outdoor recreation and nature.\n- The parishes of La Massana and Sant Julià de Lòria are known for their historic villages and cultural attractions.\n- The language spoken in Andorra is primarily Catalan, although Spanish and French are also widely spoken, particularly in the tourism and commerce sectors.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nAndorra has a well-developed public transportation system, with buses connecting the major cities and towns.
