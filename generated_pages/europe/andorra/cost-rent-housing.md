[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Andorra's housing market is characterized by a high demand for accommodation, particularly in the capital city of Andorra la Vella. The country's limited geographic area and strict building regulations contribute to a relatively low supply of housing, which can drive up prices. Typical lease terms in Andorra range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with regulations governing issues such as rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, France and Spain, Andorra's housing costs are relatively high, reflecting the country's strong economy and high standard of living.

The rental market in Andorra is highly competitive, with many apartments and houses available for rent in the capital city and surrounding areas. However, prices can be steep, particularly in the city center, where demand is highest. To find affordable accommodation, renters may need to consider sharing an apartment or looking for properties outside the city center. It's also worth noting that Andorra has a relatively high cost of living, with prices for food, transportation, and other essentials comparable to those in Western Europe.
