[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Andorra is located in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain, making it easily accessible by car, bus, or train from both countries. The main international airports serving Andorra are Andorra–La Seu d'Urgell Airport (LEU), Barcelona-El Prat Airport (BCN), and Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS), with Barcelona and Toulouse offering more frequent flights and connections to major European cities. From these airports, you can take a bus or taxi to Andorra, or rent a car and drive to your destination. The overland entry points from France and Spain are well-marked and straightforward, with several border crossings along the main roads.

The most common entry point from France is the border crossing at Pas de la Casa, while from Spain, it's the border crossing at El Pas de la Casa or the tunnel at Sant Julià de Lòria. Both France and Spain have good road networks that connect to Andorra, and the journey by car or bus takes around 2-3 hours from Barcelona or Toulouse. There are also bus services available from major cities in France and Spain, such as Paris, Madrid, and Barcelona, which can be a convenient option for those without a car.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Andorra has a limited domestic air network, with no scheduled flights between cities. The only airport in Andorra is Andorra–La Seu d'Urgell Airport (LEU), which is located in the neighboring region of Catalonia, Spain, and offers limited flights to other destinations in Spain and Europe. If you need to travel within Andorra, it's generally easier and more convenient to use buses or taxis, or to rent a car and drive. However, if you're looking for a scenic flight over the Pyrenees, there are some charter airlines and helicopter services available that offer flights over Andorra and the surrounding mountains.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Andorra has a limited rail network, with no trains connecting the country to the rest of Europe. The nearest train station is in L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre, France, or in Puigcerdà, Spain, from where you can take a bus or taxi to Andorra. There are no high-speed train options available, and the rail network within Andorra is limited to a few tourist trains and scenic railways. If you're looking for a scenic train ride, there are some tourist trains available that offer journeys through the Pyrenees mountains, but these are generally more expensive and less frequent than bus services.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Andorra has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating routes between cities and towns. The main bus companies are ALSA, Eurolines, and Interurbana, which offer frequent services to and from major cities in France and Spain, as well as within Andorra. The buses are generally modern and comfortable, with air conditioning and wi-fi available on some routes. The costs are relatively low, with a one-way ticket from Barcelona or Toulouse to Andorra la Vella costing around 20-30 euros. You can book tickets online or at the bus station, and it's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak season.
