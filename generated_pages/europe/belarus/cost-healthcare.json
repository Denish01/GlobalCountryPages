  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Belarus varies depending on the type of service and provider, with an average health expenditure per capita of $558, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 28.5% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $558\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 28.5%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 103\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: BYN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nBelarus has a mixed healthcare system, which combines elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, but it is more affordable and widely available. Locals typically use the public healthcare system, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare due to language barriers and higher quality of care. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and patient fees, while private healthcare is typically paid out-of-pocket or through private insurance. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Belarus can be complex and bureaucratic, especially for foreigners. Patients often need to pay for services upfront and then claim reimbursement from their insurance provider. Additionally, many medical professionals speak limited English, which can create communication challenges for foreigners. However, many private hospitals and clinics cater to foreigners and offer high-quality care with English-speaking staff. It is essential to research and choose a reputable healthcare provider, especially for complex medical procedures.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private dentists often offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public eye exams may not include advanced testing |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs often have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals often have more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Complex surgeries may require specialized equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals often have more advanced maternity facilities |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private clinics may have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public healthcare services, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private healthcare services, advanced medical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, advanced medical procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$20\n- Prescription rules are strictly enforced, and counterfeit medication is a significant concern\n- Pharmacy availability is widespread, with many pharmacies open 24/7\n- Medication prices can vary depending on the brand and type, with generic options often being more affordable\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number 103 or visit the nearest hospital.
