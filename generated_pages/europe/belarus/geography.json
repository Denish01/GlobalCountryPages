The country's borders are relatively flat, with no major mountain ranges or highlands. The landscape is dominated by rolling hills, forests, and agricultural lands, making it an ideal place for farming and forestry. The capital city, Minsk, is located in the central part of the country, and it is an important center of trade, culture, and politics.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe terrain of Belarus is generally flat, with an average elevation of around 162 meters above sea level.

The forests are mostly coniferous, with species such as pine, spruce, and fir being the most common.\n\nThe country's terrain is also characterized by a large number of rivers, lakes, and wetlands.

The lakes are mostly small and shallow, with the largest lake being Lake Narach, which covers an area of around 80 square kilometers.
