# Belarus Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Belarus is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on road and rail networks, as well as a reliable energy and water supply system, although there is still a notable urban-rural gap in terms of access to modern amenities.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 73%
Road Network: 94,797 km, with 85% paved
Rail Network: 5,528 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Belarus has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on modernizing its transportation networks and improving access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country's infrastructure development level is considered to be relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with a strong emphasis on maintaining and upgrading existing networks. However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to modern amenities such as high-speed internet and reliable public transportation. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's road network, with a number of major highways and interchanges being constructed or upgraded in recent years.

Despite these investments, Belarus's infrastructure still faces a number of challenges, including a lack of investment in certain sectors and a reliance on imported energy sources. The country is also heavily dependent on Russia for its energy supplies, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in the global energy market. However, the government has been working to diversify its energy sources and reduce its reliance on imported fuels, with a number of renewable energy projects being developed in recent years.

Overall, Belarus's infrastructure is relatively well-developed, but there is still a need for ongoing investment and modernization to ensure that the country can continue to support its growing economy and population. The government has been working to attract foreign investment and promote private sector development, with a number of major infrastructure projects being planned or underway.
