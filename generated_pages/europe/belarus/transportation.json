It offers direct flights to many European cities, including Moscow, Warsaw, and Amsterdam, as well as some destinations in the Middle East and Asia. If you're traveling from outside Europe, you may need to connect through a major hub such as Moscow or Istanbul. Overland entry points include border crossings with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, which can be done by bus, train, or car. The most popular overland route is from Poland, with several bus companies operating daily services from Warsaw and other Polish cities.\n\nFor those traveling by train, the main railway station in Minsk is a major hub, with connections to many European cities, including Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Warsaw. The station is located in the city center and offers a range of amenities, including restaurants, shops, and left luggage facilities. If you're planning to enter Belarus by car, make sure to check the latest regulations and requirements, including any necessary permits or insurance. It's also a good idea to research the route and road conditions in advance, as some border crossings can be busy or have limited facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nBelarus has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating internal flights. The main domestic airline is Belavia, which offers flights from Minsk to several regional airports, including Brest, Gomel, and Vitebsk. Flights are relatively frequent, with several departures per day, but booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and time of booking. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be a convenient option for traveling long distances, but may not be the most cost-effective or efficient way to get around, especially for shorter journeys.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nBelarus has an extensive rail network, with trains connecting many cities and towns across the country. The rail network is operated by Belarusian Railways, which offers a range of services, including high-speed trains and overnight sleeper services.

Bus travel is often the most affordable option, with prices starting from around $5-10 for shorter journeys. Bus stations are usually located in city centers, and tickets can be bought at the station or online in advance. Some popular bus companies include Minsktrans and Mahilëŭtrans, which operate services to many destinations across the country.
