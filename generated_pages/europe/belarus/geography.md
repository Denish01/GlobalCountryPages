[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Belarus is a landlocked country located in Eastern Europe, situated between Russia and Poland. It is bordered by five countries: Russia to the east and northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, Lithuania to the northwest, and Latvia to the north. Belarus is not surrounded by any major bodies of water, but it has a significant number of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The country's strategic location has made it an important trade and cultural hub between Europe and Asia.

Belarus is situated in the region of the East European Plain, which is a vast area of low-lying terrain that stretches from the Ural Mountains in the east to the Baltic Sea in the west. The country's borders are relatively flat, with no major mountain ranges or highlands. The landscape is dominated by rolling hills, forests, and agricultural lands, making it an ideal place for farming and forestry. The capital city, Minsk, is located in the central part of the country, and it is an important center of trade, culture, and politics.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Belarus is generally flat, with an average elevation of around 162 meters above sea level. The country's highest point, Dzyarzhynsk Hill, is located in the northwest and has an elevation of 346 meters. The lowest point is the Neman River, which forms the border with Lithuania and has an elevation of 80 meters. The landscape is dominated by forests, which cover around 40% of the country's territory. The forests are mostly coniferous, with species such as pine, spruce, and fir being the most common.

The country's terrain is also characterized by a large number of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The major rivers include the Dnieper, the Neman, and the Pripyat, which flow through the country and provide water for irrigation, drinking, and industry. The lakes are mostly small and shallow, with the largest lake being Lake Narach, which covers an area of around 80 square kilometers. The wetlands are an important habitat for wildlife, and they provide a natural filter for the water and help to regulate the climate.

Belarus has a significant number of **national parks** and nature reserves, which are protected areas that provide a habitat for wildlife and help to conserve the country's natural heritage. The national parks include the Brestsky National Park, the Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park, and the Narachansky National Park, among others.
