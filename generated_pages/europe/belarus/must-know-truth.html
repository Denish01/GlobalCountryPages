        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Belarus, officially known as the Republic of Belarus, has a complex and varied history. The territory that is now Belarus was first inhabited by the <strong>Eastern Slavs</strong> in the 6th century. In the 9th century, the area became part of the <strong>Kievan Rus'</strong>, a medieval East Slavic state. Following the decline of Kievan Rus', Belarus was absorbed into the <strong>Grand Duchy of Lithuania</strong> in the 13th century. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania merged with the <strong>Kingdom of Poland</strong> in 1569, and Belarus remained under Polish rule until the late 18th century. In 1795, Belarus was annexed by the <strong>Russian Empire</strong>, and it remained under Russian control until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Belarus declared its independence in 1918, but it was soon absorbed into the <strong>Soviet Union</strong>. The country remained a Soviet republic until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, when it gained its independence.</p>
        <p>The founding of Belarus as a modern nation-state is closely tied to the collapse of the Soviet Union. On August 25, 1991, Belarus declared its independence, and on December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved. Since then, Belarus has been a <strong>sovereign state</strong>, with its own government, economy, and international relations. The country has a <strong>presidential system</strong>, with a president serving as head of state and government. The <strong>National Assembly</strong> is the country's legislative body, composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic.</p>
        <p>Belarus has a strategic location in Eastern Europe, bordering <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Ukraine</strong>, <strong>Poland</strong>, <strong>Lithuania</strong>, and <strong>Latvia</strong>. The country's geography is characterized by a mix of forests, marshes, and plains, with several major rivers, including the <strong>Dnieper</strong> and the <strong>Neman</strong>. The climate is temperate, with cold winters and warm summers. Belarus has a diverse economy, with major industries including <strong>manufacturing</strong>, <strong>agriculture</strong>, and <strong>energy production</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's cultural heritage is also diverse, with influences from <strong>Slavic</strong>, <strong>Russian</strong>, and <strong>European</strong> traditions. The <strong>Belarusian language</strong> is an official language, along with <strong>Russian</strong>, and the country has a rich tradition of folk music, dance, and literature. The capital city, <strong>Minsk</strong>, is a major cultural center, with several museums, theaters, and historical landmarks.</p>
