        <h2>How Belarus Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Belarus is divided into six provinces (voblasts) and the municipality of Minsk, which serves as the capital. Each province is further subdivided into districts (raions) and cities of regional subordination. The provinces are Brest, Vitebsk, Gomel, Grodno, Minsk, and Mogilev. The administrative structure of Belarus is relatively centralized, with the government in Minsk holding significant authority over the provinces. This division allows for efficient governance and management of the country's resources.</p>
        <p>The six provinces of Belarus vary in terms of their economic, cultural, and geographical characteristics. For example, the Brest province is known for its border with Poland and its historical significance, while the Vitebsk province is famous for its cultural events and festivals. The provinces are also responsible for managing their own local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. This decentralization of power enables the provinces to address local issues and concerns more effectively.</p>
