  "content": "The infrastructure in Belarus is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on road and rail networks, as well as a reliable energy and water supply system, although there is still a notable urban-rural gap in terms of access to modern amenities.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 73%\nRoad Network: 94,797 km, with 85% paved\nRail Network: 5,528 km\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 0, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nBelarus has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on modernizing its transportation networks and improving access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The country's infrastructure development level is considered to be relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with a strong emphasis on maintaining and upgrading existing networks. However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to modern amenities such as high-speed internet and reliable public transportation. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's road network, with a number of major highways and interchanges being constructed or upgraded in recent years.\n\nDespite these investments, Belarus's infrastructure still faces a number of challenges, including a lack of investment in certain sectors and a reliance on imported energy sources. The country is also heavily dependent on Russia for its energy supplies, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in the global energy market. However, the government has been working to diversify its energy sources and reduce its reliance on imported fuels, with a number of renewable energy projects being developed in recent years.\n\nOverall, Belarus's infrastructure is relatively well-developed, but there is still a need for ongoing investment and modernization to ensure that the country can continue to support its growing economy and population. The government has been working to attract foreign investment and promote private sector development, with a number of major infrastructure projects being planned or underway.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 94,797 km | Good | 85% paved, with a number of major highways and interchanges |\n| Railways | 5,528 km | Good | Electrified and well-maintained, with a number of major lines and stations |\n| Airports | 4 international, 6 domestic | Good | Modern facilities and equipment, with a number of international flights |\n| Ports | 0 major, 2 river ports | Poor | Landlocked, with limited access to international shipping routes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Power generation** is primarily based on imported natural gas and domestic coal, with a number of thermal power plants and cogeneration facilities\n- The **reliability** of the energy supply is generally good, with a number of backup systems and emergency generators in place\n- **Outages** are relatively rare, but can occur during periods of high demand or extreme weather conditions\n- **Renewable energy** is becoming increasingly important, with a number of solar and wind power projects being developed in recent years\n- The government has set a target of generating 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink, with a number of modern treatment plants and distribution systems in place\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to modern sewage systems\n- **Water access** in rural areas can be limited, with some communities relying on wells or other traditional sources\n- The government has been working to improve access to clean water and sanitation, with a number of projects being implemented in recent years\n- **Wastewater treatment** is also a priority, with a number of modern facilities being constructed or upgraded\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with a number of major operators providing 2G, 3G, and 4G services\n- **Fiber/broadband** is becoming increasingly available, with a number of major cities and towns being connected to high-speed networks\n- The **4G/5G rollout** is ongoing, with a number of operators planning to launch commercial services in the near future\n- **Postal services** are provided by the state-owned Belarusian Postal Service, with a number of modern facilities and equipment in place\n- The government has been working to promote the development of the IT sector, with a number of incentives and support programs being offered to startups and entrepreneurs\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Minsk Metro** expansion project is ongoing, with a number of new lines and stations being constructed\n- The **Belarusian Railway** modernization project is planned, with a number of major upgrades and renovations being proposed\n- The **Grodno Power Plant** project is underway, with a new combined-cycle gas turbine power plant being constructed\n- The **Belarus-Russia** gas pipeline project is planned, with a number of major pipelines and facilities being proposed\n- The government has also been working to promote the development of **renewable energy** projects, with a number of incentives and support programs being offered to investors and developers",
