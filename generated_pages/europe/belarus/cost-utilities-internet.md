Belarus has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most households having access to **electricity**, **water**, and **gas**. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with some areas experiencing more frequent power outages and water supply disruptions. The cost of utilities in Belarus has been relatively stable in recent years, but it is subject to fluctuations due to changes in global energy prices and government policies. For example, the inflation rate in Belarus was 5.8% in 2024, which can affect the cost of utilities.

The cost of utilities in Belarus also varies depending on the season, with **heating** costs being significantly higher during the winter months. In fact, the cost of heating can account for up to 50% of the total utility bill during the winter. Additionally, the cost of **electricity** can also vary depending on the time of day, with peak hours (7am-10am and 5pm-8pm) being more expensive than off-peak hours.
