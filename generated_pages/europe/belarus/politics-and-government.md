[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Belarus is characterized by a strong **presidential system**, where the President holds significant powers and is both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and has the authority to appoint the Prime Minister, who is the head of government in a ceremonial capacity. The **separation of powers** is not clearly defined in the Belarusian Constitution, and the executive branch tends to dominate the legislative and judicial branches. Belarus is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and no federal divisions.

The political system in Belarus has been criticized for its lack of **democratic freedoms** and **human rights**. The government has been accused of suppressing opposition and restricting civil liberties, leading to international condemnation. The **European Union** and the **United States** have imposed sanctions on Belarus due to its poor human rights record and lack of democratic reforms.

The **Constitution of Belarus** was adopted in 1994 and has undergone several amendments since then. The Constitution establishes the framework of the government and the relationship between the different branches of power. However, the Constitution has been criticized for its ambiguity and lack of clear checks and balances on the power of the President.
