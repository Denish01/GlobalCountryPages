Belarus has a relatively low GDP per capita and a higher inflation rate compared to Poland, which has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living. Despite these differences, Belarus offers a lower cost of living, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle. The cost of living in Belarus is around 20-30% lower than in Poland, with significant savings on rent, food, and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Belarus has a more centralized economy, with a strong emphasis on state-owned enterprises, while Poland has a more liberalized economy with a growing private sector. This difference in economic structure contributes to the variation in prices and costs between the two countries. Overall, Belarus offers a more affordable lifestyle, but Poland provides a more developed infrastructure and a higher standard of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belarus (USD) | Poland (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 400 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 700 | 42.9% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belarus (USD) | Poland (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 15 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 200 | 300 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1.5 | 2.5 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belarus (USD) | Poland (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.8 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33.3% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Belarus (USD) | Poland (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 15 | 25 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Belarus (USD) | Poland (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 700 | 28.6% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33.3% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33.3% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Belarus is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in Poland\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries up to 33% cheaper\n  - Transportation, with monthly transit passes and taxi fares up to 37% lower\n  - Utilities and internet, with bills up to 40% cheaper\n- **Poland is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain luxury goods, such as high-end clothing and electronics\n  - Travel and tourism, with more developed infrastructure and amenities\n  - Education, with a more established and recognized university system\n  - Healthcare, with better-equipped hospitals and medical facilities\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nBelarus offers a more affordable lifestyle, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees on a budget.
