[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Belarus operates a **territorial tax system**, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, but non-residents are only taxed on their income derived from Belarus. The residency rules for tax purposes are based on the individual's physical presence in the country, with those spending more than 183 days in a calendar year considered tax residents. This means that expats and foreign workers may be subject to taxation on their global income if they meet the residency requirements.

The tax system in Belarus is overseen by the Ministry of Taxes and Duties, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing guidance to taxpayers. The country has a relatively complex tax system, with multiple tax rates and exemptions, making it essential for individuals and businesses to seek professional advice to ensure compliance with tax regulations.
