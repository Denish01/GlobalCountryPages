[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nBelarus has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of over 80 countries can enter Belarus visa-free for a certain period, while others need to obtain a visa in advance or on arrival. The visa policy is designed to facilitate tourism, business, and cultural exchange, while maintaining national security and immigration control. Belarus is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and has a relatively open visa policy for citizens of other CIS countries.\n\nThe visa-free access policy allows citizens of certain countries to stay in Belarus for up to 30 days, depending on the nationality and purpose of visit. However, there are specific requirements and restrictions that apply to visa-free travelers, such as registration with the local authorities and limited stay in certain areas. Visitors who require a visa can apply for a tourist, business, or transit visa, depending on the purpose of their visit. The visa application process typically involves submitting required documents, paying a fee, and waiting for the visa to be processed.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must register with local authorities |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must register with local authorities |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must register with local authorities |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must register with local authorities |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Must register with local authorities |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Visa required | 30 days | Must apply at the embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Belarus visa-free for up to 30 days, depending on their nationality.
