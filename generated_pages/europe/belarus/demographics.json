This trend is mainly due to a low fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. The country's population is also aging, with a median age of 40.5 years, which poses challenges for the labor market and social security systems. Urbanization is a significant trend in Belarus, with about 77.2% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city Minsk and other major cities like Gomel and Mogilev.\n\nThe urban population in Belarus is characterized by a relatively high standard of living, with access to better education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. However, the rural population faces significant challenges, including limited access to basic services, lower incomes, and a lack of job opportunities. Migration patterns in Belarus are also noteworthy, with many young and educated individuals emigrating to other European countries in search of better job prospects and higher living standards.\n\nThe population of Belarus is also affected by regional disparities, with the western regions being more densely populated and economically developed than the eastern regions.
