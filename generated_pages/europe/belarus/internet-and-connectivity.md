The internet in Belarus is generally of good quality, with average download speeds of 25 Mbps, allowing for smooth browsing, streaming, and online communication. However, there is a noticeable urban vs rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in cities like Minsk, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall internet infrastructure in Belarus is relatively well-developed, with a good level of reliability, making it suitable for most users, including tourists and business travelers.

The government has been investing in the development of the country's internet infrastructure, which has led to improvements in recent years. However, there are still some limitations and restrictions on internet use, particularly when it comes to accessing certain websites and online services. Additionally, the internet can be slower and less reliable during peak hours or in areas with high usage, but overall, it is relatively stable and widely available.

To get a SIM card in Belarus, you can visit one of the main carrier's stores, such as MTS or Velcom, and purchase a tourist SIM card, which usually costs around 10 USD. You will need to provide your passport and fill out a registration form, but the process is relatively straightforward and quick. It's recommended to buy a SIM card from a official carrier store or a reputable reseller, as this will ensure that you get a genuine SIM card and avoid any potential scams. The main carriers, such as MTS and Velcom, offer a range of data plans and packages, including tourist-friendly options with affordable rates and decent data allowances.
