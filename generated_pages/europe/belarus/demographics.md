[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Belarus has been experiencing a decline in recent years, with a negative growth rate of approximately -0.3% per annum. This trend is mainly due to a low fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. The country's population is also aging, with a median age of 40.5 years, which poses challenges for the labor market and social security systems. Urbanization is a significant trend in Belarus, with about 77.2% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city Minsk and other major cities like Gomel and Mogilev.

The urban population in Belarus is characterized by a relatively high standard of living, with access to better education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. However, the rural population faces significant challenges, including limited access to basic services, lower incomes, and a lack of job opportunities. Migration patterns in Belarus are also noteworthy, with many young and educated individuals emigrating to other European countries in search of better job prospects and higher living standards.

The population of Belarus is also affected by regional disparities, with the western regions being more densely populated and economically developed than the eastern regions. The country's population is projected to continue declining in the coming years, which will have significant implications for the economy, healthcare, and social security systems.
