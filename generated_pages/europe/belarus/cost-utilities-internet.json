However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location, with some areas experiencing more frequent power outages and water supply disruptions. The cost of utilities in Belarus has been relatively stable in recent years, but it is subject to fluctuations due to changes in global energy prices and government policies. For example, the inflation rate in Belarus was 5.8% in 2024, which can affect the cost of utilities.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Belarus also varies depending on the season, with **heating** costs being significantly higher during the winter months. In fact, the cost of heating can account for up to 50% of the total utility bill during the winter. Additionally, the cost of **electricity** can also vary depending on the time of day, with peak hours (7am-10am and 5pm-8pm) being more expensive than off-peak hours.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $5 | $5 | (included in rent) |\n| **Total** | **$65** | **$100** | **$135** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $10-15 | 10 Mbps | YooMoney, MTS |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $20-30 | 100 Mbps | YooMoney, MTS |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 5 GB | MTS, Velcom |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $15-25 | 10 GB | MTS, Velcom |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | YooMoney, MTS |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. ivi.ru) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Belarus, you will typically need to provide proof of residence and identification, and sign a contract with the utility provider.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but they can be more expensive than postpaid plans.\n- The best internet providers in Belarus are YooMoney and MTS, which offer fast and reliable connections.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It is also a good idea to negotiate with your landlord or utility provider to see if you can get a better rate on your utilities.",
