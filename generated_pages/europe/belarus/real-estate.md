[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Belarus has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by government initiatives to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic development. The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a growing demand for modern apartments and commercial spaces. Prices have been rising, particularly in the capital city of Minsk, where the demand for housing and office space is highest. The urban areas, such as Minsk and other major cities, tend to have higher prices and rental yields compared to rural areas. However, the rural areas are also experiencing growth, driven by the development of tourism and agriculture.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from apartments and houses to commercial spaces and land plots. The price trajectory has been steadily increasing, with an average annual growth rate of 5-7%. The government has implemented various measures to support the property market, including subsidies for first-time buyers and incentives for developers to build affordable housing. Despite these efforts, the market remains relatively small and niche, with limited international demand.

The property market in Belarus is also influenced by the country's strategic location, with proximity to major European markets and access to the Eurasian Economic Union. This has attracted interest from foreign investors, particularly from Russia, Ukraine, and other neighboring countries. However, the market is still largely driven by domestic demand, with locals accounting for the majority of property purchases.
