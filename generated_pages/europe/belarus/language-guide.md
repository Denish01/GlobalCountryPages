[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Belarus is dominated by the two official languages, Belarusian and Russian. Belarusian is the national language and is spoken by around 30% of the population, while Russian is the most widely spoken language, used by around 70% of the population. There are also several regional dialects, including the North-Eastern and South-Western dialects of Belarusian. Minority languages, such as Ukrainian and Polish, are also spoken in certain regions of the country. English is not widely spoken in Belarus, particularly outside of the capital city Minsk, and visitors may find it difficult to communicate in English, especially with older generations.

Despite the limited English proficiency, many young people in Belarus are learning English as a second language, and it is becoming more widely spoken in tourist areas and among those in the service industry. However, it is still important for visitors to learn some basic phrases in Belarusian or Russian to help navigate the country and interact with locals. Belarusian and Russian are both Slavic languages, and while they share some similarities, they are distinct languages with their own grammar and vocabulary.

The use of language in Belarus is also influenced by the country's history and cultural identity. During the Soviet era, Russian was the dominant language, and it was used as the language of government, education, and media. Since independence, there has been an effort to promote the use of Belarusian, and it is now used in many official contexts. However, Russian remains the most widely spoken language, and it is still commonly used in everyday life.
