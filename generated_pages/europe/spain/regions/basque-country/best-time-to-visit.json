  "content": "The best time to visit Basque Country is during the spring and autumn months when the weather is mild and pleasant, making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploring the region's culture. \n[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Basque Country: May, June, September, and October. Peak season: July and August. Budget season: November to March. Avoid: January and February due to cold and rainy weather. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nBasque Country has a mild **oceanic climate**, with significant rainfall throughout the year. The region experiences four distinct seasons, with spring and autumn being the most pleasant. The dry season, which typically occurs during the summer months, is characterized by mild temperatures and minimal rainfall. In contrast, the wet season, which occurs during the winter months, is marked by heavy rainfall and cooler temperatures. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season during the summer months attracting large crowds and higher prices.\n\nThe region's climate is influenced by its proximity to the **Cantabrian Sea**, which moderates the temperature and creates a unique microclimate. The coastal areas tend to be milder than the inland regions, which can experience colder temperatures during the winter months. The **Pyrenees Mountains** also play a role in shaping the region's climate, with the mountains creating a rain shadow effect that results in a drier climate in the eastern parts of the region.\n\nOverall, the best time to visit Basque Country depends on personal preferences and interests. Those who enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and surfing may prefer the spring and autumn months, while those who prefer cultural events and festivals may prefer the summer months. The winter months can be a good time to visit for those on a budget, as prices tend to be lower and the region is less crowded.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Museum visits, indoor activities |\n| February | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Wine tasting, cultural events |\n| March | Mild and sunny | Medium | $$ | Outdoor activities, festivals |\n| April | Mild and sunny | Medium | $$ | Hiking, surfing, spring festivals |\n| May | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Outdoor activities, cultural events |\n| June | Warm and sunny | High | $$$ | Beach activities, summer festivals |\n| July | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beach activities, outdoor concerts |\n| August | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beach activities, summer festivals |\n| September | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Outdoor activities, cultural events |\n| October | Mild and sunny | Medium | $$ | Hiking, surfing, autumn festivals |\n| November | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Museum visits, indoor activities |\n| December | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Christmas markets, cultural events |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| San Sebastian Film Festival | September | A prestigious film festival featuring international and local films |\n| Bilbao BBK Live | July | A music festival featuring rock, pop, and electronic music |\n| Semana Grande | August | A week-long festival in Bilbao featuring music, dance, and cultural events |\n| Fiestas de la Virgen de Begoña | August | A religious festival in Bilbao featuring processions and cultural events |\n| Euskal Jaiak | September | A festival celebrating Basque culture and traditions |\n| San Juan Festival | June | A festival featuring bonfires, music, and cultural events |\n| Azkena Rock Festival | June | A rock music festival featuring local and international bands |\n| Getxo International Jazz Festival | July | A jazz festival featuring local and international musicians |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **coastal regions** tend to be milder and sunnier than the inland regions, making them ideal for beach activities and outdoor sports.\n- The **Pyrenees Mountains** offer a unique climate and landscape, with colder temperatures and more rainfall than the coastal regions.\n- The **Rioja Alavesa** region is known for its wine production and is a popular destination for wine tasting and vineyard tours.\n- The **Guipuzcoa** region is home to the city of San Sebastian, which is known for its cultural events and festivals.\n- The **Biscay** region is home to the city of Bilbao, which is known for its cultural attractions and festivals.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, which offers mild weather and lower prices.\n- Pack layers for your trip, as the weather can be unpredictable and cooler in the mornings and evenings.\n- Don't forget to try the local cuisine, which features a range of seafood, meat, and pintxos (small snacks).\n- Be aware of the **siesta** culture, which can affect business hours and tourist attractions.\n- Learn some basic **Basque phrases**, such as \"kaixo\" (hello) and \"espero\" (thank you), to show respect for the local culture.",
