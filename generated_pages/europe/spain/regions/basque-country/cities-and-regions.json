The region is divided into seven provinces, with three in Spain (Araba, Gipuzkoa, and Bizkaia) and four in France (Lapurdi, Behorlegi, Zuberoa, and Nafarroa Beherea). Each province has its own capital city and governing body, with Vitoria-Gasteiz serving as the capital of the Spanish Basque Country. The provinces are further divided into municipalities, each with their own local government and administration.\n\nThe division of the Basque Country into provinces is largely based on historical and cultural factors, with each province having its own unique identity and traditions.
