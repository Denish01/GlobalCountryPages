[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Basque Country, an autonomous region in northern Spain, is known for its rich culture, stunning landscapes, and vibrant cities. The region has a strong sense of community, and visitors often comment on the warm hospitality of the locals. However, as with any popular tourist destination, there are areas that require extra caution, particularly in larger cities like Bilbao and San Sebastián.
