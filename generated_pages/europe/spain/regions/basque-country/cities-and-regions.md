[SECTION] How Basque Country Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Basque Country is an autonomous region in northern Spain and southwestern France, with its own distinct culture, language, and history. The region is divided into seven provinces, with three in Spain (Araba, Gipuzkoa, and Bizkaia) and four in France (Lapurdi, Behorlegi, Zuberoa, and Nafarroa Beherea). Each province has its own capital city and governing body, with Vitoria-Gasteiz serving as the capital of the Spanish Basque Country. The provinces are further divided into municipalities, each with their own local government and administration.

The division of the Basque Country into provinces is largely based on historical and cultural factors, with each province having its own unique identity and traditions. The provinces in Spain are part of the autonomous community of the Basque Country, while the provinces in France are part of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. Despite these administrative divisions, the Basque Country is a cohesive region with a strong sense of identity and shared culture.
