[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Basque Country: May, June, September, and October. Peak season: July and August. Budget season: November to March. Avoid: January and February due to cold and rainy weather. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Basque Country has a mild **oceanic climate**, with significant rainfall throughout the year. The region experiences four distinct seasons, with spring and autumn being the most pleasant. The dry season, which typically occurs during the summer months, is characterized by mild temperatures and minimal rainfall. In contrast, the wet season, which occurs during the winter months, is marked by heavy rainfall and cooler temperatures. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season during the summer months attracting large crowds and higher prices.

The region's climate is influenced by its proximity to the **Cantabrian Sea**, which moderates the temperature and creates a unique microclimate. The coastal areas tend to be milder than the inland regions, which can experience colder temperatures during the winter months. The **Pyrenees Mountains** also play a role in shaping the region's climate, with the mountains creating a rain shadow effect that results in a drier climate in the eastern parts of the region.

Overall, the best time to visit Basque Country depends on personal preferences and interests. Those who enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and surfing may prefer the spring and autumn months, while those who prefer cultural events and festivals may prefer the summer months. The winter months can be a good time to visit for those on a budget, as prices tend to be lower and the region is less crowded.
