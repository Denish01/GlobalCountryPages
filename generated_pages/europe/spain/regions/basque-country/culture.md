# Basque Country Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

The Basque Country, an autonomous region in northern Spain, boasts a unique and rich culture shaped by its distinct language, history, and traditions. 

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
The Basque Country's culture is defined by its strong sense of identity and distinctiveness from the rest of Spain. The region is home to the Basque people, an ethnic group with their own language, **Euskara**, which is a language isolate, meaning it is not related to any other known language. The Basque people have a long history dating back to the pre-Roman era, and their culture has been influenced by various civilizations, including the Romans, the Moors, and the French. The region's cultural identity is also shaped by its strategic location between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pyrenees Mountains, which has made it a crossroads for trade and cultural exchange.

The Basque Country is a bilingual region, with both **Euskara** and Spanish being official languages. However, the use of **Euskara** is more prevalent in the northern parts of the region, while Spanish is more widely spoken in the southern areas. The region's ethnic makeup is predominantly Basque, with a small proportion of immigrants from other parts of Spain and Europe. The Basque people are known for their strong sense of community and social cohesion, which is reflected in their vibrant festivals, traditions, and cultural events.

The Basque Country's cultural identity is also shaped by its strong industrial and maritime heritage. The region has a long history of shipbuilding, steel production, and textile manufacturing, which has contributed to its economic development and cultural diversity. The region's cuisine, architecture, and folklore are all reflective of its unique cultural identity and history.
