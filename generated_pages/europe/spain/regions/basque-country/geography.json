The region borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, where it has a coastline of approximately 150 kilometers, and it is surrounded by the autonomous communities of Navarre to the southeast and Castile and León to the south, as well as the autonomous community of Cantabria to the west.\n\nThe Basque Country is divided into three provinces: Biscay, Gipuzkoa, and Álava, each with its own unique character and geography. The region's location on the Atlantic coast and its proximity to the Pyrenees Mountains create a diverse landscape, with a mix of coastal plains, mountains, and valleys. The Basque Country is also home to several major rivers, including the Nervión, the Ibaizabal, and the Deba, which flow through the region and empty into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe terrain of the Basque Country is characterized by a mix of mountains, valleys, and coastal plains. The Pyrenees Mountains form the eastern border of the region, with peaks reaching elevations of over 1,500 meters. The highest point in the Basque Country is Aitzkorri, which is located in the Aralar Range and has an elevation of 1,551 meters. The mountains give way to rolling hills and valleys, which are home to many of the region's towns and cities. The coastal plains, which are found along the Atlantic coast, are generally flat and fertile, and are home to many of the region's agricultural areas.\n\nThe Basque Country is also home to several major rivers, which flow through the region and empty into the Atlantic Ocean. The Nervión River, which flows through the city of Bilbao, is one of the most important rivers in the region, and it has played a significant role in the development of the city and its industries. The Ibaizabal River, which flows through the city of Durango, is another major river in the region, and it is known for its scenic beauty and its importance as a habitat for wildlife. The Deba River, which forms the border between the provinces of Gipuzkoa and Álava, is a smaller but still significant river, and it is known for its picturesque valleys and gorges.\n\nThe landscape of the Basque Country is also characterized by its forests, which cover much of the region. The forests are home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including many species of trees, such as beech, oak, and pine, as well as animals, such as deer, wild boar, and birds of prey. The forests are also an important part of the region's economy, with many industries, such as forestry and woodworking, relying on the region's forest resources.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 10-20°C | 100-150 mm | Mild and rainy |\n| Summer | June to August | 20-25°C | 50-100 mm | Warm and dry |\n| Autumn | September to November | 10-20°C | 150-200 mm | Cool and rainy |\n| Winter | December to February | 5-15°C | 100-150 mm | Cool and wet |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: May to October.
