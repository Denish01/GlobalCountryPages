[SECTION] How Catalonia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Catalonia is an autonomous region in Spain, divided into four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. Each province has its own capital city and is further divided into comarques, which are local administrative divisions that group together municipalities. The provinces of Catalonia vary in terms of their geography, economy, and culture, with the province of Barcelona being the most populous and economically developed.

The administrative structure of Catalonia is designed to provide a balance between regional autonomy and local self-government. The Generalitat de Catalunya, the regional government, is responsible for matters such as education, healthcare, and transportation, while the provinces and comarques have their own administrative bodies that deal with local issues. This system allows for a high degree of decentralization and flexibility, enabling Catalonia to respond to the needs of its diverse regions and cities.
