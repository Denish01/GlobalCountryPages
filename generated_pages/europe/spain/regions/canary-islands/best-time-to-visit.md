[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Canary Islands, located off the northwest coast of Africa, have a subtropical climate, with mild temperatures and moderate humidity levels throughout the year. The islands are divided into two main climate zones: the coastal areas, which are generally warm and dry, and the mountainous regions, which are cooler and more humid. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by clear skies and warm temperatures, while the wet season, from November to April, is marked by occasional rainfall and cooler temperatures. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season attracting large crowds and higher prices, while the off-season offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices.

The Canary Islands' unique geography, with volcanic mountains and coastal areas, creates a variety of microclimates, making the weather conditions vary from island to island. The northern islands, such as Tenerife and Gran Canaria, tend to be cooler and more humid than the southern islands, such as Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. The mountainous regions, such as the Teide National Park in Tenerife, can be quite cool, even in the summer months, while the coastal areas can be quite hot during the peak season.

The best time to visit the Canary Islands depends on the specific activities and experiences you are looking for. If you prefer warm weather and beach activities, the summer months are the best time to visit. However, if you prefer hiking, cycling, or other outdoor activities, the spring and autumn months are ideal, with mild temperatures and fewer crowds.
