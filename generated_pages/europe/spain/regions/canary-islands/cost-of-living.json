[/SECTION]\nThe Canary Islands, located off the northwest coast of Africa, are a Spanish archipelago with a subtropical climate and stunning natural beauty. The cost of living in the Canary Islands is generally moderate, with prices comparable to other European destinations. However, the islands' remote location and limited connectivity to the mainland can drive up the cost of certain goods and services, particularly food and transportation. Compared to other European island destinations, such as the Azores or Madeira, the Canary Islands offer a relatively affordable lifestyle, with a unique blend of Spanish and African influences.\n\nIn terms of global averages, the Canary Islands are more expensive than many destinations in Latin America or Southeast Asia, but more affordable than many major cities in Western Europe or North America.
