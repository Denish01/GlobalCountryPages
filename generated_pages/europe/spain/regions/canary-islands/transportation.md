[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Canary Islands are easily accessible by air, with two main international airports, Gran Canaria Airport (LPA) and Tenerife South Airport (TFS), receiving direct flights from major European cities, including Madrid, London, and Berlin. Additionally, Tenerife North Airport (TFN) serves as a hub for domestic flights and some international routes. Visitors can also arrive by sea, with several ferry operators connecting the islands to mainland Spain and other neighboring islands.

The islands' strategic location off the northwest coast of Africa makes them an attractive destination for tourists and travelers. With a well-developed airport infrastructure, getting to the Canary Islands is relatively straightforward. Several airlines, including Iberia, Ryanair, and EasyJet, operate direct flights to the islands from various European cities. Furthermore, the islands' airports are well-connected to each other, making it easy to travel between the different islands.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights are a convenient way to travel between the Canary Islands, with several airlines, including Binter Canarias and CanaryFly, operating frequent flights between the islands. The main routes include Gran Canaria to Tenerife, Fuerteventura to Lanzarote, and La Palma to El Hierro. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, to secure the best fares. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from 50 to 200 EUR, depending on the route and time of booking.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The Canary Islands have a limited rail network, with only one railway line operating on the island of Tenerife, connecting the capital city, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, with the northern town of La Laguna. The tram system in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is a convenient way to get around the city, with two lines covering major tourist areas. However, for longer distances, buses and ferries are the primary modes of public transportation. The booking process for trains and trams is relatively straightforward, with tickets available at stations or online.
