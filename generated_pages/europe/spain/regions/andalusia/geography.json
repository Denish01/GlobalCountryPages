It shares borders with the autonomous communities of Extremadura to the west, Castile-La Mancha to the north, and Murcia to the east. The region is also bounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest, with the Strait of Gibraltar separating it from Morocco. The strategic location of Andalusia has made it an important cultural and trade hub throughout history, with influences from various civilizations, including the Romans, Moors, and Christians.\n\nAndalusia's borders are marked by diverse landscapes, from the **Sierra Nevada** mountain range in the east to the **Gibraltar Strait** in the south. The region's proximity to Africa and its unique geography have created a distinct cultural and environmental identity. The capital city of Andalusia is Seville, which is located in the western part of the region and is known for its rich history, architecture, and vibrant cultural scene. Other major cities in Andalusia include Granada, Cordoba, and Malaga, each with its own unique character and attractions.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nAndalusia's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, from mountains and hills to coastal plains and valleys. The **Sierra Nevada** mountain range, which includes the highest peak in mainland Spain, **Mulhacén**, stretches across the eastern part of the region. The mountains are home to a variety of flora and fauna, including several species of eagles, ibex, and wild boar. The **Guadalquivir River**, which flows through the region, has created a fertile valley that is suitable for agriculture and supports a wide range of crops, including olives, grapes, and citrus fruits.\n\nThe coastal areas of Andalusia are marked by a mix of sandy beaches, rocky shores, and cliffs, with the **Costa del Sol** being one of the most popular tourist destinations in the region. The coastline is dotted with ports, fishing villages, and historic towns, such as Cadiz and Huelva, which have played an important role in the region's maritime trade and cultural exchange. Inland, the landscape is dominated by rolling hills, olive groves, and vast expanses of **tabernas**, or badlands, which are characteristic of the region's semi-arid climate.\n\nThe unique geography of Andalusia has also created a variety of microclimates, with the **Alpujarra** region, for example, being known for its mild winters and cool summers. The **Doñana National Park**, which is located in the western part of the region, is one of the most important wetland areas in Europe, providing a habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, fish, and mammals.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 15-25°C | moderate | mild, sunny |\n| Summer | June to August | 25-35°C | low | hot, dry |\n| Autumn | September to November | 15-25°C | moderate | mild, sunny |\n| Winter | December to February | 5-15°C | high | cool, rainy |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: April to June and September to November.
