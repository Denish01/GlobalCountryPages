[SECTION] How Andalusia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Andalusia is divided into eight provinces, each with its own provincial capital and a range of municipalities. The provinces are further divided into comarcas, which are groups of municipalities that share cultural, economic, or geographic ties. This administrative structure allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while also providing a framework for regional coordination and cooperation. The eight provinces of Andalusia are Almería, Cádiz, Córdoba, Granada, Huelva, Jaén, Málaga, and Seville, each with its own unique character and attractions.

The division of Andalusia into provinces and comarcas reflects the region's complex history and geography. The provinces were established in the 19th century, and have since been modified to reflect changes in population and economic development. The comarcas, on the other hand, are often based on traditional geographic or cultural divisions, and provide a way of organizing municipalities around shared interests or characteristics.
