The region can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal areas and the inland regions. The coastal areas have a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 12°C to 25°C (54°F to 77°F) throughout the year. In contrast, the inland regions experience a more extreme climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The dry season in Andalusia typically runs from May to October, while the wet season occurs from November to April. Understanding the seasons is essential for planning a trip to Andalusia, as it affects the availability of tourist attractions, outdoor activities, and accommodation prices.\n\nThe spring season, which lasts from March to May, is an excellent time to visit Andalusia, with mild temperatures and fewer tourists. The autumn season, which spans from September to November, is also a great time to visit, with comfortable temperatures and a vibrant cultural scene. The summer months, June to August, are peak tourist season, with hot weather and crowded tourist areas. The winter months, December to February, are the low season, with cooler temperatures and fewer tourists, making it an ideal time for budget travelers.\n\nAndalusia's climate and seasons have a significant impact on travel plans, as some tourist attractions and outdoor activities may be closed or limited during the off-season.
