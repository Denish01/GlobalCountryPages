The provinces are further divided into comarcas, which are groups of municipalities that share cultural, economic, or geographic ties. This administrative structure allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while also providing a framework for regional coordination and cooperation. The eight provinces of Andalusia are Almería, Cádiz, Córdoba, Granada, Huelva, Jaén, Málaga, and Seville, each with its own unique character and attractions.\n\nThe division of Andalusia into provinces and comarcas reflects the region's complex history and geography. The provinces were established in the 19th century, and have since been modified to reflect changes in population and economic development. The comarcas, on the other hand, are often based on traditional geographic or cultural divisions, and provide a way of organizing municipalities around shared interests or characteristics.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Seville** (population over 700,000)\nRole: capital, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic center, including the Cathedral of Seville and the Royal Alcázar, as well as its vibrant cultural scene and traditional festivals.\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and architecture.\n\n**Málaga** (population over 570,000)\nRole: economic hub, port city\nKnown For: its historic center, including the Gibralfaro Castle and the Picasso Museum, as well as its modern port and commercial facilities.\nBest For: visitors interested in business, trade, and cultural events.\n\n**Granada** (population over 230,000)\nRole: cultural center, tourist destination\nKnown For: its historic Alhambra palace and the Generalife gardens, as well as its vibrant cultural scene and traditional festivals.\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and natural beauty.\n\n**Córdoba** (population over 330,000)\nRole: cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its historic center, including the Mezquita (Mosque-Cathedral) and the Roman Bridge, as well as its vibrant cultural scene and traditional festivals.\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and architecture.\n\n**Cádiz** (population over 120,000)\nRole: port city, tourist destination\nKnown For: its historic center, including the Cathedral of Cádiz and the Roman Theatre, as well as its vibrant cultural scene and beautiful beaches.\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and relaxation.\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Almería | Coastal, desert | Beaches, natural parks, film sets | Almería |\n| Cádiz | Coastal, historic | Beaches, historic center, Carnival | Cádiz |\n| Córdoba | Inland, historic | Mezquita, Roman Bridge, countryside | Córdoba |\n| Granada | Mountainous, historic | Alhambra, Generalife, Sierra Nevada | Granada |\n| Huelva | Coastal, natural | Beaches, natural parks, mining heritage | Huelva |\n| Jaén | Inland, rural | Olive groves, countryside, historic towns | Jaén |\n| Málaga | Coastal, urban | Historic center, port, cultural events | Málaga |\n| Seville | Inland, historic | Historic center, Cathedral, Royal Alcázar | Seville |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The coastal regions of Andalusia, such as Almería and Cádiz, have a distinct maritime culture and economy, with a focus on fishing, tourism, and trade.\n- The inland regions, such as Córdoba and Jaén, have a more rural character, with a focus on agriculture, particularly olive production.\n- The mountainous regions, such as Granada, have a unique cultural and natural heritage, with a focus on tourism, skiing, and outdoor activities.\n- The urban regions, such as Seville and Málaga, have a more cosmopolitan character, with a focus on business, culture, and education.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nAndalusia has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, and buses connecting the major cities and regions. The high-speed train (AVE) links Seville, Córdoba, and Málaga to Madrid and other major cities in Spain, while regional trains and buses provide frequent services to smaller towns and villages. The roads in Andalusia are generally good, and driving is a convenient way to explore the region, particularly in rural areas. However, traffic in the cities can be heavy, and parking can be limited.
