[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Galicia's cuisine is defined by its coastal location and the resulting abundance of fresh seafood, as well as its rural landscape and the traditional farming practices that come with it. The region's unique cultural heritage, which includes Celtic and Atlantic influences, is also reflected in its food. Galician cuisine is known for its hearty, comforting dishes that often feature locally-sourced ingredients such as **pulpo** (octopus), **merluza** (hake), and **grelos** (turnip greens). The region is also famous for its **queimada**, a traditional spirit made from **oruxo** (a type of grape pomace) and flavored with coffee, sugar, and lemon.

Galician cuisine varies from region to region, with the coastal areas specializing in seafood dishes and the inland areas focusing on meat and vegetable-based dishes. The **Rías Baixas** region, for example, is known for its **albariño** wine and fresh seafood, while the **Rías Altas** region is famous for its **empanadas** and **tetilla** cheese. The city of **Santiago de Compostela**, a major pilgrimage site, has its own unique culinary traditions, including the **pulpo a feira** dish.

The key to Galician cuisine is the use of high-quality, locally-sourced ingredients and traditional cooking methods. Many dishes are slow-cooked over an open flame, which gives them a rich, flavorful taste. The region's cuisine is also heavily influenced by its history and culture, with many dishes named after local landmarks, festivals, and traditions. For example, the **empanada gallega** is a traditional pastry filled with seafood or meat, which is often served at festivals and celebrations.
