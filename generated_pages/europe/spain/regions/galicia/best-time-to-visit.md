[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Galicia, a region in northwest Spain, has a **temperate maritime climate**, characterized by mild temperatures and significant rainfall throughout the year. The region can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal area, which has a milder climate, and the interior, which is colder and more prone to fog. The **dry season** in Galicia is relatively short, lasting from June to September, while the **wet season** runs from October to May. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Galicia, as the weather can be quite unpredictable, with frequent rain showers and strong winds, especially during the winter months.

The summer months are the best time to visit Galicia's beaches and enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, and water sports. The spring and autumn seasons are ideal for exploring the region's cities, such as Santiago de Compostela and A Coruña, and visiting its many cultural attractions, such as museums, historical landmarks, and festivals. The winter months, although cold and rainy, can be a good time to visit Galicia's thermal spas and enjoy the region's traditional cuisine, such as **pulpo a feira** (boiled octopus) and **empanada** (meat or seafood pie).

The climate in Galicia can vary significantly depending on the region. The coastal areas tend to be milder and sunnier, while the interior is colder and more prone to fog. The **Rías Baixas** region, known for its beautiful beaches and scenic coastline, has a microclimate that is slightly warmer and drier than the rest of Galicia. The **Serra dos Ancares** mountains, on the other hand, have a colder and more rugged climate, with significant snowfall during the winter months.
