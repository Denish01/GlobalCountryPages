  "content": "Galicia, an autonomous region in northwest Spain, is divided into four provinces and has a distinct cultural and geographical identity, with the main cities and regions showcasing its rich history, stunning landscapes, and vibrant traditions.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAdministrative Divisions: 4 provinces (A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense, Pontevedra)\nLargest City: Vigo, population 292,000\nCapital: Santiago de Compostela\nNumber of Cities Over 1M: 0\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] How Galicia Is Divided [/SECTION]\nGalicia is divided into four provinces: A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense, and Pontevedra. Each province has its own capital city and is further divided into municipalities, which are the basic administrative units of the region. The provinces are grouped into two main areas: the coastal region, which includes the provinces of A Coruña and Pontevedra, and the interior region, which includes the provinces of Lugo and Ourense. This division reflects the geographical and cultural differences between the coastal and interior areas, with the coastal region being more urbanized and industrialized, and the interior region being more rural and traditional.\n\nThe administrative structure of Galicia is based on the principles of autonomy and decentralization, with the regional government having significant powers in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The regional government is headed by a president, who is elected by the Galician Parliament, and is responsible for implementing regional policies and managing the regional budget. The provinces and municipalities also have their own governments and administrations, which are responsible for providing local services and managing local affairs.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Vigo** (292,000)\nRole: economic hub and port city\nKnown For: its stunning coastline, rich maritime history, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n**A Coruña** (245,000)\nRole: provincial capital and industrial center\nKnown For: its well-preserved Roman walls, beautiful beaches, and lively nightlife\nBest For: visitors interested in history, architecture, and entertainment\n**Santiago de Compostela** (95,000)\nRole: capital city and cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning cathedral, rich cultural heritage, and vibrant pilgrim trail\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and spirituality\n**Lugo** (98,000)\nRole: provincial capital and agricultural center\nKnown For: its well-preserved Roman walls, beautiful countryside, and traditional cuisine\nBest For: visitors interested in history, nature, and local culture\n**Ourense** (106,000)\nRole: provincial capital and thermal center\nKnown For: its natural hot springs, stunning scenery, and rich cultural heritage\nBest For: visitors interested in wellness, nature, and culture\n**Pontevedra** (83,000)\nRole: provincial capital and commercial center\nKnown For: its beautiful old town, stunning coastline, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n**Ferrol** (68,000)\nRole: industrial center and naval base\nKnown For: its rich maritime history, stunning coastline, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, industry, and outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A Coruña | coastal and urban | beaches, Roman walls, nightlife | A Coruña |\n| Lugo | rural and traditional | Roman walls, countryside, local cuisine | Lugo |\n| Ourense | thermal and natural | hot springs, scenery, cultural heritage | Ourense |\n| Pontevedra | coastal and commercial | old town, coastline, cultural scene | Pontevedra |\n| Rías Baixas | coastal and scenic | beaches, seafood, wine | Vigo |\n| Costa da Morte | coastal and rugged | coastline, lighthouses, traditional villages | Camariñas |\n| Sierra de Ancares | mountainous and natural | scenery, hiking, traditional culture | Becerreá |\n| Ribeira Sacra | rural and scenic | countryside, wine, cultural heritage | Monforte de Lemos |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The coastal regions of A Coruña and Pontevedra are more urbanized and industrialized, with a strong focus on tourism and trade.\n- The interior regions of Lugo and Ourense are more rural and traditional, with a strong focus on agriculture and local culture.\n- The climate varies across the region, with the coastal areas being milder and the interior areas being colder and more mountainous.\n- The language and culture also vary across the region, with the Galician language being more widely spoken in the rural areas and the Spanish language being more widely spoken in the urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nGalicia has a well-developed transportation network, with several domestic airports, including the Santiago de Compostela Airport and the Vigo Airport, which offer connections to major cities in Spain and Europe. The region is also connected by a network of trains and buses, which provide regular services to all major towns and cities. The train network is operated by Renfe, the Spanish national railway company, and offers connections to major cities in Spain, including Madrid and Barcelona. The bus network is operated by several private companies, including ALSA and Monbus, and offers connections to all major towns and cities in the region.\n\nDriving is also a popular option, with the region having a well-maintained network of roads and highways. The AP-9 highway connects the region to the rest of Spain, while the AG-55 and AG-56 highways connect the major cities and towns within the region. Car rental services are widely available, and many companies offer one-way rentals and airport pickups. However, driving in Galicia can be challenging, especially in the rural areas, where the roads are narrow and winding.
