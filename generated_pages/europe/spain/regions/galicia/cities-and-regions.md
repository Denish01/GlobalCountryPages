[SECTION] How Galicia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Galicia is divided into four provinces: A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense, and Pontevedra. Each province has its own capital city and is further divided into municipalities, which are the basic administrative units of the region. The provinces are grouped into two main areas: the coastal region, which includes the provinces of A Coruña and Pontevedra, and the interior region, which includes the provinces of Lugo and Ourense. This division reflects the geographical and cultural differences between the coastal and interior areas, with the coastal region being more urbanized and industrialized, and the interior region being more rural and traditional.

The administrative structure of Galicia is based on the principles of autonomy and decentralization, with the regional government having significant powers in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The regional government is headed by a president, who is elected by the Galician Parliament, and is responsible for implementing regional policies and managing the regional budget. The provinces and municipalities also have their own governments and administrations, which are responsible for providing local services and managing local affairs.

Galicia has a well-developed transportation network, with several domestic airports, including the Santiago de Compostela Airport and the Vigo Airport, which offer connections to major cities in Spain and Europe.
