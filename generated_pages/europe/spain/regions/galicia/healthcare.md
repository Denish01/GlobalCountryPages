The system is primarily publicly funded, with some private healthcare providers also operating in the region. The quality of care in Galicia is generally high, with well-equipped hospitals and specialized medical facilities. Urban areas, such as the capital city of Santiago de Compostela, have better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where resources may be more limited. However, the regional government has made efforts to improve healthcare access in rural areas, including the implementation of telemedicine services and mobile health units.

The public healthcare system in Galicia is free for all citizens and registered residents, including foreigners who have obtained a residence permit. Private healthcare providers also operate in the region, offering specialized services and faster access to medical care.

These programs have contributed to the region's high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates.
