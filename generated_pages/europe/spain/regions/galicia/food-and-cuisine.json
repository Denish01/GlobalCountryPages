The region's unique cultural heritage, which includes Celtic and Atlantic influences, is also reflected in its food. Galician cuisine is known for its hearty, comforting dishes that often feature locally-sourced ingredients such as **pulpo** (octopus), **merluza** (hake), and **grelos** (turnip greens). The region is also famous for its **queimada**, a traditional spirit made from **oruxo** (a type of grape pomace) and flavored with coffee, sugar, and lemon.\n\nGalician cuisine varies from region to region, with the coastal areas specializing in seafood dishes and the inland areas focusing on meat and vegetable-based dishes. The **Rías Baixas** region, for example, is known for its **albariño** wine and fresh seafood, while the **Rías Altas** region is famous for its **empanadas** and **tetilla** cheese. The city of **Santiago de Compostela**, a major pilgrimage site, has its own unique culinary traditions, including the **pulpo a feira** dish.\n\nThe key to Galician cuisine is the use of high-quality, locally-sourced ingredients and traditional cooking methods. Many dishes are slow-cooked over an open flame, which gives them a rich, flavorful taste. The region's cuisine is also heavily influenced by its history and culture, with many dishes named after local landmarks, festivals, and traditions. For example, the **empanada gallega** is a traditional pastry filled with seafood or meat, which is often served at festivals and celebrations.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pulpo a Feira | Seafood | Traditional octopus dish | Restaurants in Santiago de Compostela |\n| Empanada Gallega | Pastry | Savory pastry filled with seafood or meat | Bakeries and cafes throughout Galicia |\n| Caldo Gallego | Soup | Hearty soup made with vegetables, beans, and meat | Restaurants in rural areas |\n| Lacón con Grelos | Meat | Braised pork shoulder with turnip greens | Restaurants in the Rías Baixas region |\n| Arroz con Mariscos | Seafood | Saffron-infused rice with seafood | Restaurants in coastal areas |\n| Tetilla Cheese | Dairy | Soft, creamy cheese from the Rías Altas region | Cheese shops and markets |\n| Choripán | Meat | Grilled sausage sandwich | Street food stalls in cities |\n| Pan con Tomate | Vegetable | Fresh tomato on bread, often served with **jamón** or **chorizo** | Cafes and restaurants throughout Galicia |\n| Filloas | Dessert | Thin, sweet pancakes filled with cream or fruit | Bakeries and cafes throughout Galicia |\n| Torta de Aceite | Dessert | Sweet, crumbly cake made with **aceite** (olive oil) | Bakeries and cafes throughout Galicia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Churros con Chocolate**: fried dough pastries served with rich, thick chocolate (3-4 USD)\n- **Tortilla de Patatas**: thick, creamy omelette made with potatoes and onions (4-5 USD)\n- **Bocadillo de Calamares**: fried squid sandwich (5-6 USD)\n- **Croquetas**: deep-fried balls filled with ham, fish, or chicken (4-5 USD)\n- **Patatas Bravas**: spicy fried potatoes in a tomato-based sauce (4-5 USD)\n- **Aceitunas**: marinated olives, often served as a snack or appetizer (2-3 USD)\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Albariño**: crisp, white wine from the Rías Baixas region\n- **Tetilla Coffee**: strong, rich coffee made with **tetilla** milk\n- **Oruxo**: traditional spirit made from grape pomace\n- **Queimada**: traditional coffee-based drink made with **oruxo** and sugar\n- **Freshly squeezed orange juice**: a popular breakfast drink\n- **Cerveza Gallega**: local beer from Galicia\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with your hands is generally frowned upon**, except for snacks like **churros** or **patatas bravas**\n- **Tipping is expected**, but not mandatory, in restaurants and bars\n- **Reservations are recommended** for popular restaurants, especially during peak travel season\n- **Dress codes vary** depending on the restaurant, but **smart casual** is generally acceptable\n- **Mealtimes are sacred**, and **lunch** is often the main meal of the day\n- **Food is a social occasion**, and **meals are often enjoyed with family and friends**\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Mercados**: bustling markets where you can find fresh produce, seafood, and local specialties\n- **Tabernas**: traditional taverns serving local wine, beer, and snacks\n- **Restaurante**: formal restaurants serving a range of Galician dishes\n- **Cafeterías**: cafes serving coffee, pastries, and light meals\n- **Food courts**: modern food courts offering a variety of international and local cuisine\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Mercado de Abastos** in Santiago de Compostela: a bustling market offering fresh produce, seafood, and local specialties\n- **Feria de la Pulpo** in O Carballiño: a festival celebrating the region's famous octopus dish\n- **Rías Baixas Wine Route**: a scenic route through the region's wine country, with opportunities to taste local wines and cheeses\n- **Galician Cheese Festival** in Arzúa: a festival celebrating the region's rich cheese-making traditions\n- **Santiago de Compostela Food Tour**: a guided tour of the city's culinary highlights, including markets, restaurants, and food shops",
