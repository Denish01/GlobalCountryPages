[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nGalicia, a region in northwest Spain, has a **temperate maritime climate**, characterized by mild temperatures and significant rainfall throughout the year. The region can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal area, which has a milder climate, and the interior, which is colder and more prone to fog. The **dry season** in Galicia is relatively short, lasting from June to September, while the **wet season** runs from October to May. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Galicia, as the weather can be quite unpredictable, with frequent rain showers and strong winds, especially during the winter months.\n\nThe summer months are the best time to visit Galicia's beaches and enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, and water sports. The spring and autumn seasons are ideal for exploring the region's cities, such as Santiago de Compostela and A Coruña, and visiting its many cultural attractions, such as museums, historical landmarks, and festivals. The winter months, although cold and rainy, can be a good time to visit Galicia's thermal spas and enjoy the region's traditional cuisine, such as **pulpo a feira** (boiled octopus) and **empanada** (meat or seafood pie).\n\nThe climate in Galicia can vary significantly depending on the region. The coastal areas tend to be milder and sunnier, while the interior is colder and more prone to fog. The **Rías Baixas** region, known for its beautiful beaches and scenic coastline, has a microclimate that is slightly warmer and drier than the rest of Galicia. The **Serra dos Ancares** mountains, on the other hand, have a colder and more rugged climate, with significant snowfall during the winter months.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Visiting thermal spas, trying local cuisine |\n| February | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Attending the **Carnaval** festival in Vilagarcía de Arousa |\n| March | Mild and rainy | Low | $ | Exploring the region's cities, visiting museums |\n| April | Mild and sunny | Med | $$ | Hiking, cycling, visiting the **Rías Baixas** region |\n| May | Warm and sunny | Med | $$ | Visiting the **Festa do Mar** in Pontevedra, enjoying outdoor activities |\n| June | Warm and sunny | Med | $$$ | Visiting the **Festival de Música de Cámara** in Santiago de Compostela, enjoying the beach |\n| July | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Visiting the **Festival de Ortigueira**, enjoying the beach and outdoor activities |\n| August | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Visiting the **Festa da Virxe da Barca** in Muxía, enjoying the beach and outdoor activities |\n| September | Warm and sunny | Med | $$$ | Visiting the **Festa de San Froilán** in Lugo, enjoying the harvest season |\n| October | Mild and rainy | Med | $$ | Exploring the region's cities, visiting museums, trying local cuisine |\n| November | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Visiting the **Festa de Santo André** in Teo, trying local cuisine |\n| December | Cool and rainy | Low | $$ | Visiting the **Festa de Nadal** in Santiago de Compostela, trying local cuisine |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Carnaval** | February | A colorful festival with parades, music, and dancing in Vilagarcía de Arousa |\n| **Festa do Mar** | May | A festival celebrating the sea and the region's maritime heritage in Pontevedra |\n| **Festival de Música de Cámara** | June | A classical music festival featuring chamber music performances in Santiago de Compostela |\n| **Festival de Ortigueira** | July | A festival of traditional music and dance in Ortigueira |\n| **Festa da Virxe da Barca** | August | A festival celebrating the patron saint of Muxía, with music, dancing, and fireworks |\n| **Festa de San Froilán** | September | A festival celebrating the patron saint of Lugo, with music, dancing, and traditional food |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Rías Baixas** region has a milder climate and is more prone to sunshine, making it ideal for beachgoers and outdoor enthusiasts.\n- The **Serra dos Ancares** mountains have a colder and more rugged climate, with significant snowfall during the winter months, making it ideal for winter sports enthusiasts.\n- The **Costa da Morte** region has a more rugged coastline and is more prone to strong winds and rough seas, making it ideal for surfers and adventure seekers.\n- The **Terra de Soneira** region has a more rural and traditional way of life, with a strong focus on agriculture and local cuisine, making it ideal for those interested in rural tourism.\n- The **Rías Altas** region has a more urban and cosmopolitan feel, with a strong focus on culture and entertainment, making it ideal for city breakers and cultural enthusiasts.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to June or September to October, to avoid the crowds and high prices of peak season.\n- Pack layers and waterproof clothing, as the weather in Galicia can be unpredictable and rainy, even during the summer months.\n- Don't miss the opportunity to try the local cuisine, including **pulpo a feira**, **empanada**, and **tetilla** (a type of cheese), and to visit the region's many festivals and cultural events.\n- Be aware of the **fiestas** and **festas** that take place throughout the year, as they can be a fun and exciting way to experience the local culture, but can also disrupt traffic and accommodation availability.",
