[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
The Community of Madrid is situated in the heart of the Iberian Peninsula, bordering the autonomous communities of Castile and León to the north and west, and Castilla-La Mancha to the south and east. The community is landlocked, with no direct access to the sea, but it is strategically located near the geographic center of the peninsula, making it an important hub for transportation and communication. The capital city, Madrid, is also the capital of Spain and is located near the center of the community, making it a key location for politics, economy, and culture.

The Community of Madrid is surrounded by mountains, with the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range to the north and west, and the Sierra de Toledo mountain range to the south. The community's location in the interior of the peninsula makes it a transitional zone between the Mediterranean and Atlantic climates, with a mix of continental and oceanic influences. The proximity to the mountains and the altitude of the community, which ranges from 400 to 2,000 meters above sea level, also contribute to its unique climate and geography.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of the Community of Madrid is characterized by a mix of mountains, valleys, and plains. The Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range, which includes the highest point in the community, Siete Picos, is a prominent feature of the landscape. The mountains are covered with forests of pine, oak, and beech trees, and are home to a variety of wildlife, including deer, wild boar, and birds of prey. The valleys and plains, such as the Valley of the Tajo River, are fertile and suitable for agriculture, with crops such as wheat, barley, and grapes being grown in the area.

The community's landscape is also dotted with reservoirs, lakes, and rivers, which provide water for irrigation, drinking water, and hydroelectric power. The Tajo River, which flows through the community, is one of the most important rivers in Spain and provides water for the city of Madrid and other surrounding towns. The landscape of the Community of Madrid is also characterized by a number of natural parks and protected areas, which provide habitat for a variety of flora and fauna and offer opportunities for outdoor recreation such as hiking, skiing, and fishing.

The community's terrain and landscape have been shaped by millions of years of geological history, with the mountains and valleys being formed by the movement of tectonic plates and the erosion of rocks by water and wind. The community's location in the interior of the peninsula, far from the coast, has also contributed to its unique geology, with a lack of marine fossils and a dominance of terrestrial rocks such as granite and limestone.
