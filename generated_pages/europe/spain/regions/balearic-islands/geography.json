The archipelago consists of five main islands: Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Formentera, and Cabrera. The islands are surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the east, south, and west, and are bordered by the Valencian Community and the Region of Murcia to the north and west, respectively, although they do not share a land border with these regions. The Balearic Islands are a part of the autonomous community of the same name, which is one of the 17 autonomous communities of Spain.\n\nThe strategic location of the Balearic Islands has made them an important hub for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The islands are situated at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, making them a natural stopping point for ships traveling between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. As a result, the Balearic Islands have been influenced by a diverse range of cultures, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Moors, and Spanish, each of which has left its mark on the islands' architecture, language, and customs.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe Balearic Islands are a diverse and scenic archipelago, with a range of landscapes and ecosystems. The largest island, Mallorca, is home to the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range, which runs along the northwestern coast of the island and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The highest point in the Balearic Islands, Puig Major, is located in this range and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The islands are also home to a number of beautiful beaches, bays, and coves, including the famous Cala Mondrago in Mallorca and the secluded beaches of Formentera.\n\nIn addition to their natural beauty, the Balearic Islands are also home to a number of unique and endemic species, including the **Balearic shearwater**, a seabird that is found only in the islands, and the **Ibiza wall lizard**, a species of lizard that is found only on the island of Ibiza. The islands are also an important stopping point for migratory birds, and are home to a number of nature reserves and protected areas, including the **S'Albufera Nature Reserve** in Mallorca and the **Es Tudons Nature Reserve** in Menorca.\n\nThe islands' landscape has also been shaped by human activity, including agriculture, mining, and urbanization. The Balearic Islands have a long history of agricultural production, and are known for their production of **olive oil**, **wine**, and **citrus fruits**. The islands are also home to a number of historic towns and villages, including the capital city of **Palma de Mallorca**, which is known for its beautiful architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and rich history.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 15-22°C | 40-60 mm | Mild and sunny, with occasional rain showers |\n| Summer | June to August | 25-30°C | 10-20 mm | Hot and dry, with high humidity |\n| Autumn | September to November | 18-25°C | 60-80 mm | Warm and sunny, with occasional rain showers |\n| Winter | December to February | 10-15°C | 40-60 mm | Cool and wet, with occasional cold snaps |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: May to October.
