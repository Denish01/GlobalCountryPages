[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
The Balearic Islands are situated in the western Mediterranean Sea, approximately 80 kilometers off the eastern coast of Spain. The archipelago consists of five main islands: Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Formentera, and Cabrera. The islands are surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the east, south, and west, and are bordered by the Valencian Community and the Region of Murcia to the north and west, respectively, although they do not share a land border with these regions. The Balearic Islands are a part of the autonomous community of the same name, which is one of the 17 autonomous communities of Spain.

The strategic location of the Balearic Islands has made them an important hub for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The islands are situated at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, making them a natural stopping point for ships traveling between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. As a result, the Balearic Islands have been influenced by a diverse range of cultures, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Moors, and Spanish, each of which has left its mark on the islands' architecture, language, and customs.

The Balearic Islands are a diverse and scenic archipelago, with a range of landscapes and ecosystems. The largest island, Mallorca, is home to the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range, which runs along the northwestern coast of the island and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The islands are also an important stopping point for migratory birds, and are home to a number of nature reserves and protected areas, including the **S'Albufera Nature Reserve** in Mallorca and the **Es Tudons Nature Reserve** in Menorca.

The islands' landscape has also been shaped by human activity, including agriculture, mining, and urbanization.

The islands are also home to a number of historic towns and villages, including the capital city of **Palma de Mallorca**, which is known for its beautiful architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and rich history.
