  "content": "Spain is a **parliamentary constitutional monarchy** with a complex system of government that divides power between the monarch, the prime minister, and the legislature. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy\nHead of State: King Felipe VI\nHead of Government: Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez\nLegislature: Cortes Generales, bicameral (Congress of Deputies and Senate), 350 seats in Congress and 266 seats in Senate\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 23rd out of 178 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 31st out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe Spanish government is based on the **separation of powers**, with the monarch serving as the head of state and the prime minister as the head of government. The **Cortes Generales**, the Spanish legislature, is a bicameral body composed of the **Congress of Deputies** and the **Senate**. The Congress of Deputies has 350 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The Senate has 266 seats, with 208 members elected by proportional representation and 58 members appointed by the regional legislatures. The government is responsible for proposing legislation, which is then debated and voted on by the Cortes Generales.\n\nThe Spanish political system is also characterized by a **decentralized** structure, with significant powers granted to the country's 17 **autonomous communities** and two **autonomous cities**. Each autonomous community has its own regional government, known as the **Junta**, which is responsible for a range of areas including education, healthcare, and transportation. This decentralized system allows for a significant degree of regional autonomy, but also creates challenges for national policy-making and coordination.\n\nThe **Spanish Constitution**, which was adopted in 1978, provides the framework for the country's government and politics. The Constitution establishes Spain as a **social and democratic state of law**, and sets out the principles of **liberty**, **justice**, and **equality**. It also guarantees a range of fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Government of Spain | Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez | Head of government, responsible for proposing legislation and overseeing the administration of the country |\n| Legislative | Cortes Generales | President of the Congress of Deputies Meritxell Batet | Bicameral legislature, responsible for debating and voting on legislation |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court Carlos Lesmes | Highest court in the land, responsible for interpreting the Constitution and ensuring that laws are consistent with it |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) | Center-left | Pedro Sánchez | 120 | Currently in government, with a focus on social and economic issues |\n| People's Party (PP) | Center-right | Alberto Núñez Feijóo | 89 | Main opposition party, with a focus on economic growth and law and order |\n| Vox | Right-wing | Santiago Abascal | 52 | Nationalist party, with a focus on immigration and law and order |\n| United We Can (Unidas Podemos) | Left-wing | Yolanda Díaz | 35 | Coalition of left-wing parties, with a focus on social and economic issues |\n| Citizens (Cs) | Center-right | Inés Arrimadas | 10 | Liberal party, with a focus on economic growth and social issues |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The **electoral system** in Spain is based on proportional representation, with voters electing members to the Congress of Deputies and the Senate.\n- **General elections** are held every four years, with the most recent election taking place in November 2019.\n- The **next election** is scheduled to take place in 2023, although the exact date has not been confirmed.\n- **Voter participation** in Spanish elections is generally high, with turnout rates ranging from 60-80% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current **political climate** in Spain is characterized by a high degree of polarization, with significant divisions between the main parties.\n- **Key issues** facing the Spanish government include the economy, immigration, and regional nationalism, particularly in Catalonia.\n- **Regional dynamics** play a significant role in Spanish politics, with the country's autonomous communities and cities having a high degree of autonomy.\n- **Freedom indices** such as the Freedom House index and the World Press Freedom Index rank Spain as a **free country**, with a high degree of protection for individual rights and freedoms.\n- The **Catalan independence movement** remains a significant challenge for the Spanish government, with ongoing tensions and protests in the region.\n- **Economic challenges** also pose a significant threat to Spain's stability, with high levels of unemployment and debt remaining major concerns.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Spain is a **member of the European Union** and the **United Nations**, and plays an active role in international affairs.\n- The country has **key alliances** with other European countries, as well as with the United States and other global powers.\n- Spain is also a **member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**, and contributes to international peacekeeping and security efforts.\n- The country has a **diplomatic stance** that emphasizes **multilateralism** and **cooperation**, with a focus on promoting peace, stability, and human rights around the world.\n- Spain also has a **special relationship** with **Latin America**, with significant cultural, economic, and historical ties to the region.",
