Spain, with its large and diverse economy, offers a wide range of options for accommodation, food, and transportation, which can be quite affordable, especially outside of major cities like Madrid and Barcelona. Gibraltar, on the other hand, is a small, affluent territory with a high standard of living, which translates to higher prices for most goods and services. Overall, Spain is generally cheaper than Gibraltar, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower. This makes Spain an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a affordable and comfortable lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Spain has a large and diverse economy, with a strong service sector, a significant manufacturing industry, and a growing tourism sector. Gibraltar, on the other hand, has a small but prosperous economy, driven primarily by financial services, tourism, and shipping. The differences in economic context and the size of the two countries contribute to the variations in cost of living, with Spain offering more affordable options for accommodation, food, and transportation.
