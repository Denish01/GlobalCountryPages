[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Spain has a mixed healthcare system, which combines public and private providers to offer comprehensive medical care to its citizens and residents. The public healthcare system, known as the **Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS)**, provides universal coverage to all citizens, including foreigners with a residence visa, and is generally considered to be of high quality. However, wait times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and some specialized treatments may not be readily available. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers faster access to medical services and more personalized attention, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to access private healthcare services and avoid potential language barriers in the public system.

The public healthcare system in Spain is generally well-regarded, with modern facilities and well-trained medical professionals. However, the system can be bureaucratic, and navigating it as a foreigner can be challenging. For locals, the public system is often the first point of contact for medical care, and most people have a **medico de cabecera (primary care physician)** who provides routine check-ups and referrals to specialists as needed. For foreigners, it is often easier to access private healthcare services, which may offer more flexible scheduling and English-speaking staff.
