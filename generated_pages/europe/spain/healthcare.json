  "content": "Healthcare in Spain is considered to be of high quality, with a well-organized public healthcare system and a wide range of private healthcare options available, making it an attractive destination for medical tourists and expats alike.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: Excellent\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Excellent\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Spanish healthcare system is a universal system, providing comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents, including foreigners who are registered with the system. The public healthcare system is primarily funded through taxes and social security contributions, and it provides access to a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. The quality of care in Spain is generally very high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have more specialized and better-equipped facilities.\n\nIn addition to the public healthcare system, there are also many private healthcare options available in Spain, including private hospitals and clinics. These private facilities often offer more personalized attention and shorter waiting times than public facilities, but they can be expensive. Many expats and medical tourists choose to use private healthcare facilities, either because they are not eligible for the public system or because they prefer the higher level of service.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Spain is decentralized, with each region responsible for its own healthcare services. This can result in some variations in the quality and availability of care between regions. However, overall, the Spanish healthcare system is considered to be one of the best in the world, with high patient satisfaction rates and good health outcomes.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital Universitario La Paz | Madrid | Public | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia | Valencia | Public | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Hospital Quirónsalud Barcelona | Barcelona | Private | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron | Barcelona | Public | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Clinica Universidad de Navarra | Pamplona | Private | General, specialized | Yes |\n| Hospital Costa del Sol | Marbella | Private | General, specialized | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for everyone, including expats and tourists, as it can provide additional coverage and benefits not available through the public system.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including plans from companies such as Sanitas and Adeslas, which offer a range of coverage options and prices.\n- **Coverage for expats** is available through some insurance companies, including those that specialize in expat insurance, such as Cigna and Allianz.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the type and level of coverage, as well as the age and health status of the individual.\n- **Public health insurance** is available to all residents, including foreigners who are registered with the system, and it provides comprehensive coverage for most medical services.\n- **Supplemental insurance** is also available, which can provide additional coverage for services not covered by the public system, such as dental care and prescription medications.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Availability of medications** is generally good, with most common medications available at pharmacies throughout the country.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter, including pain relievers and antihistamines.\n- **Common brands** are widely available, including international brands such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.\n- **Costs** can vary, but many medications are subsidized by the public healthcare system, making them relatively affordable.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with pharmacies located throughout urban and rural areas, and many are open late or 24 hours.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include those for measles, mumps, and rubella, as well as tetanus and diphtheria.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include those for hepatitis A and B, as well as influenza.\n- **Endemic diseases** include influenza and respiratory infections, which are common during the winter months.\n- **Water safety** is generally good, with tap water safe to drink throughout the country.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, with strict regulations and inspections in place to ensure the safety of food.\n- **Other health risks** include heat stroke and sunburn, particularly during the summer months, as well as altitude sickness in mountainous areas.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and fertility treatments.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Hospital Quirónsalud Barcelona and the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, which are both internationally accredited.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many medical procedures costing less in Spain than in other European countries or the United States.\n- **Language** is not typically a barrier, as many medical professionals speak English, particularly in tourist areas and larger cities.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **What to do in an emergency** is to call the emergency number, 112, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with ambulances available throughout the country and equipped with modern medical equipment.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by calling the emergency number or by asking locals for directions.\n- **Insurance claims** can be filed through the public healthcare system or through private insurance companies, depending on the type of coverage.\n- **Emergency services** are widely available, including emergency rooms and urgent care centers, which are open 24 hours a day.",
