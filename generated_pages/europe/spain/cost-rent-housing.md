[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Spain is relatively competitive, with a wide range of options available in major cities like Madrid and Barcelona. Typical lease terms in Spain are 12 months, although shorter-term leases are available for a higher premium. Deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent, and tenants have strong rights under Spanish law. The **Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos** (LAU) governs rental agreements, providing protections for tenants against unfair eviction and rent increases. Compared to its regional neighbors, Spain's housing costs are generally lower than those in France but higher than those in Portugal.

The Spanish housing market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by tourism and foreign investment. However, this growth has also led to concerns about **gentrification** and affordability, particularly in major cities. As a result, the Spanish government has implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Spain remains competitive, and renters should be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property.
