[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Spanish government is based on the **separation of powers**, with the monarch serving as the head of state and the prime minister as the head of government. The **Cortes Generales**, the Spanish legislature, is a bicameral body composed of the **Congress of Deputies** and the **Senate**. The Congress of Deputies has 350 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The Senate has 266 seats, with 208 members elected by proportional representation and 58 members appointed by the regional legislatures. The government is responsible for proposing legislation, which is then debated and voted on by the Cortes Generales.

The Spanish political system is also characterized by a **decentralized** structure, with significant powers granted to the country's 17 **autonomous communities** and two **autonomous cities**. Each autonomous community has its own regional government, known as the **Junta**, which is responsible for a range of areas including education, healthcare, and transportation. This decentralized system allows for a significant degree of regional autonomy, but also creates challenges for national policy-making and coordination.

The **Spanish Constitution**, which was adopted in 1978, provides the framework for the country's government and politics. The Constitution establishes Spain as a **social and democratic state of law**, and sets out the principles of **liberty**, **justice**, and **equality**. It also guarantees a range of fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association.
