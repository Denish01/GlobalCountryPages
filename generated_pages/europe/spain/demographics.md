[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Spain's population size is significant in the context of Europe, with the country ranking as the fifth most populous in the European Union. The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the past few decades, with a current rate of 0.2%, which is lower than the European average. This decline is largely due to a low fertility rate, which has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman since the 1980s. Urbanization is a dominant trend in Spain, with approximately 77.4% of the population living in urban areas, with the majority concentrated in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia. Migration patterns have also played a significant role in shaping the population, with Spain experiencing a significant influx of immigrants from North Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe in recent years.

The population of Spain has been affected by various factors, including economic conditions, education, and healthcare. The country has a well-developed healthcare system, which has contributed to a high life expectancy of 83.5 years. However, the population is also aging, with a median age of 43.1 years, which poses challenges for the pension system and the workforce. The population density is relatively high, with an average of 97.6 people per square kilometer, which can put pressure on infrastructure and services in urban areas.

In terms of regional distribution, the population is concentrated in the central and coastal regions, with the autonomous communities of Madrid, Catalonia, and Andalusia accounting for approximately 50% of the population. The rural population is declining, with many young people moving to urban areas in search of better job opportunities and education. This trend has resulted in a significant urban-rural divide, with rural areas facing challenges such as aging populations, limited access to services, and economic decline.
