  "content": "Healthcare costs in Spain vary depending on the type of service and provider, with public healthcare generally being more affordable than private healthcare, and prices ranging from $20 to $200 for a doctor's visit, and $500 to $5,000 for a hospital stay.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $3,107 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 20.9% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Public / Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSpain has a mixed healthcare system, which combines public and private providers to offer comprehensive medical care to its citizens and residents. The public healthcare system, known as the **Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS)**, provides universal coverage to all citizens, including foreigners with a residence visa, and is generally considered to be of high quality. However, wait times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and some specialized treatments may not be readily available. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers faster access to medical services and more personalized attention, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance to access private healthcare services and avoid potential language barriers in the public system.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Spain is generally well-regarded, with modern facilities and well-trained medical professionals. However, the system can be bureaucratic, and navigating it as a foreigner can be challenging. For locals, the public system is often the first point of contact for medical care, and most people have a **medico de cabecera (primary care physician)** who provides routine check-ups and referrals to specialists as needed. For foreigners, it is often easier to access private healthcare services, which may offer more flexible scheduling and English-speaking staff.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: free with SNS card, Private: varies by clinic |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Public: requires referral, Private: direct access |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: limited services, Private: comprehensive care |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: limited services, Private: comprehensive care |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public: free with SNS card, Private: varies by clinic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public: free with SNS card, Private: varies by hospital |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$1,000 | Public: free with SNS card, Private: varies by hospital |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$5,000 | Public: free with SNS card, Private: varies by clinic |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$5,000 | Public: free with SNS card, Private: varies by hospital |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$1,000 | Public: free with SNS card, Private: varies by clinic |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Public: free with SNS card, Private: varies by clinic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, limited private coverage |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, including specialist consultations and hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy, but are generally lower than in the US.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available in pharmacies and supermarkets.\n- Prescription rules are strict, and medication can only be dispensed by a licensed pharmacist.\n- Pharmacies are abundant in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas.\n- Some medication may require a doctor's prescription, while others may be available over-the-counter.\n- Prices for common medications like **ibuprofen** and **antibiotics** are generally lower than in the US, ranging from $5 to $20.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial **112** to reach the emergency services. Ambulances are widely available, and emergency rooms are equipped to handle a range of medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)** or private health insurance to access medical care in case of an emergency. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Spain include the **Hospital Universitario La Paz** in Madrid and the **Hospital Clínic** in Barcelona, which offer high-quality medical care and English-speaking staff. It is also a good idea to research local medical facilities and emergency services before traveling to Spain, and to carry a list of important phone numbers and documents, such as your health insurance card and passport.",
