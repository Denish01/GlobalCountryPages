[SECTION] How Spain Is Divided [/SECTION]
Spain is a decentralized country, with a system of autonomous communities and provinces that have a significant degree of autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The 17 autonomous communities, including Catalonia, Andalusia, and the Basque Country, have their own regional governments and parliaments, while the 2 autonomous cities, Ceuta and Melilla, are located on the north coast of Africa. This system of government allows for a high degree of regional diversity and specialization, with different regions developing their own unique cultural, economic, and social characteristics.

The administrative divisions of Spain are also reflected in its provincial structure, with 50 provinces that are grouped into the 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities. Each province has its own capital city and is responsible for providing certain public services, such as law enforcement and transportation. This system of government has helped to promote regional development and cooperation, while also allowing for a high degree of local autonomy and self-governance.
