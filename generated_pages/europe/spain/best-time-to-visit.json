Peak season: June to August. Budget season: November to March. Avoid: July and August if you're sensitive to heat and crowds, and December if you're looking for beach activities. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nSpain is a diverse country with various climate zones, ranging from the Mediterranean coast to the Atlantic coast and the mountainous regions. The country can be divided into four main climate zones: the Mediterranean climate, the Atlantic climate, the continental climate, and the mountainous climate. The Mediterranean climate, which covers most of the country, is characterized by hot summers and mild winters, with most of the rainfall occurring during the winter months. The Atlantic climate, found in the north, is milder and wetter, with significant rainfall throughout the year. The continental climate, found in the central region, has cold winters and hot summers, while the mountainous climate is cold and snowy during the winter months.\n\nThe seasons in Spain have a significant impact on travel, with the summer months being the peak tourist season. The warm weather and school vacations make it an ideal time for families and sun-seekers to visit the beaches and popular tourist destinations. However, this also means that the prices for accommodations and tourist attractions are at their highest, and the crowds can be overwhelming. On the other hand, the spring and autumn months offer a more pleasant climate, with mild temperatures and fewer crowds, making it an ideal time for city breaks, hiking, and cultural activities.\n\nThe winter months, from December to February, are generally cooler and wetter, with some regions experiencing snowfall. While it may not be the best time to visit the beaches, it's an excellent time to explore the cities, visit museums, and enjoy the festive atmosphere. The winter season is also a great time to visit the ski resorts in the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and wet | Low | $ | City breaks, museum visits, shopping |\n| February | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Carnival celebrations, ski resorts |\n| March | Mild and sunny | Med | $$ | Spring festivals, hiking, city breaks |\n| April | Mild and sunny | Med | $$ | Easter celebrations, beaches, outdoor activities |\n| May | Warm and sunny | Med | $$ | Spring festivals, hiking, city breaks |\n| June | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beaches, outdoor activities, festivals |\n| July | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beaches, outdoor activities, festivals |\n| August | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beaches, outdoor activities, festivals |\n| September | Warm and sunny | Med | $$ | Beaches, outdoor activities, festivals |\n| October | Mild and sunny | Med | $$ | Autumn festivals, hiking, city breaks |\n| November | Cool and wet | Low | $ | City breaks, museum visits, shopping |\n| December | Cool and wet | Low | $ | Christmas markets, ski resorts, city breaks |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| La Tomatina | August | A famous tomato-throwing festival in Buñol |\n| Semana Santa | March/April | Easter celebrations and processions throughout the country |\n| Las Fallas | March | A festival of fireworks and bonfires in Valencia |\n| Feria de Abril | April | A spring festival in Seville with music, dance, and food |\n| La Mercè | September | A festival in Barcelona with music, dance, and fireworks |\n| Día de los Reyes | January | A celebration of the Epiphany with parades and gift-giving |\n| Fiestas de San Fermín | July | A festival in Pamplona with bull running and parties |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Mediterranean coast** has a hot and dry summer, making it ideal for beach activities from June to September.\n- The **Atlantic coast** has a milder climate, with cooler summers and warmer winters, making it suitable for outdoor activities throughout the year.\n- The **mountainous regions** have a cold and snowy winter, making them ideal for ski resorts from December to March.\n- The **southern region** of Andalusia has a hot and dry summer, making it ideal for visiting the cities and cultural attractions during the spring and autumn months.\n- The **northern region** of Catalonia has a milder climate, with cooler summers and warmer winters, making it suitable for outdoor activities throughout the year.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tourist attractions in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and crowds.\n- Consider visiting during the **shoulder season**, from April to May and September to October, for a more pleasant climate and lower prices.\n- Pack **lightweight and breathable clothing** for the summer months, and **warm and waterproof clothing** for the winter months.\n- Don't forget to try the local cuisine, including **tapas**, **paella**, and **gazpacho**, which are available throughout the year.\n- Be aware of the **public holidays**, including the Día de los Reyes in January and the Día de la Constitución in December, which may affect the opening hours of tourist attractions and businesses.\n- Consider purchasing a **Spanish SIM card** or **portable Wi-Fi hotspot** to stay connected during your trip.",
