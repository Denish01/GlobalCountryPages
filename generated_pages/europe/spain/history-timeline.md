# Spain History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Spain is a complex and diverse narrative that spans over two millennia, from the ancient civilizations of the Iberian Peninsula to the modern era of a unified Spanish state.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The earliest known history of Spain dates back to the pre-Roman era, with the **Iberians** and **Celts** inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula. The Romans later conquered the region, and it became a vital part of the Roman Empire. With the fall of the Roman Empire, various **Germanic tribes** and **Moors** from North Africa invaded and settled in the peninsula, shaping the country's language, culture, and identity. The **Reconquista**, a period of Christian reconquest, lasted for nearly eight centuries, ultimately leading to the unification of Spain under a single monarchy. The modern era saw Spain become a major colonial power, with its empire spanning across the Americas, Africa, and Asia, before eventually declining and giving way to a tumultuous 20th century.

The **Spanish Empire** reached its zenith in the 16th and 17th centuries, with the **Habsburg** and **Bourbon** dynasties ruling the country. However, the empire's decline began in the 18th century, with the loss of several colonies in the Americas and the rise of other European powers. The 19th and 20th centuries saw Spain experience a series of **civil wars**, **dictatorships**, and **regime changes**, including the **Spanish Civil War** and the subsequent **Franco regime**. The country's transition to democracy in the late 20th century marked a significant turning point in its history, with Spain becoming a modern, **constitutional monarchy** and a member of the European Union.

From the works of **Miguel de Cervantes** and **Federico García Lorca** to the art of **Pablo Picasso** and **Salvador Dalí**, Spanish culture has had a profound impact on the world. The country's rich cultural heritage is also reflected in its architecture, cuisine, and festivals, with the **Tomatina** festival and **La Sagrada Família** being just two examples of Spain's unique cultural expressions.
