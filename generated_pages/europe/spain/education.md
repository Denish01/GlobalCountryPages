[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Spain is divided into three main stages: **primary education** (educación primaria), which lasts for six years, **secondary education** (educación secundaria), which lasts for four years, and **tertiary education** (educación superior), which includes university and vocational training. The quality of education in Spain is generally high, with a strong emphasis on public schooling, which is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 16. Private schools, including international schools, are also available, but at a higher cost. The public school system is well-funded and well-structured, with a strong focus on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language.

The Spanish education system is known for its **bilingual programs**, which offer students the opportunity to study in both Spanish and a foreign language, such as English or French. This has become increasingly popular in recent years, as it provides students with a competitive edge in the global job market. Additionally, Spain has a strong tradition of **vocational training**, which provides students with practical skills and training in a specific trade or industry. This has helped to reduce unemployment rates among young people and has provided businesses with a skilled and knowledgeable workforce.

Overall, the education system in Spain is well-regarded and provides students with a wide range of academic options and opportunities. However, like any education system, it is not without its challenges, including **inequality and regional disparities**. Some regions, such as the Basque Country and Catalonia, have more autonomy over their education systems and have implemented their own reforms and initiatives, which has led to some disparities in the quality of education across the country.
