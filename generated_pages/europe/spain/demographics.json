  "content": "The population of Spain is a diverse and complex mix of ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups, with approximately 49.3 million people living in the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 49.3 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.2%\nMedian Age: 43.1 years\nUrban Population: 77.4%\nPopulation Density: 97.6 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 83.5 years\nFertility Rate: 1.3 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nSpain's population size is significant in the context of Europe, with the country ranking as the fifth most populous in the European Union. The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the past few decades, with a current rate of 0.2%, which is lower than the European average. This decline is largely due to a low fertility rate, which has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman since the 1980s. Urbanization is a dominant trend in Spain, with approximately 77.4% of the population living in urban areas, with the majority concentrated in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia. Migration patterns have also played a significant role in shaping the population, with Spain experiencing a significant influx of immigrants from North Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe in recent years.\n\nThe population of Spain has been affected by various factors, including economic conditions, education, and healthcare. The country has a well-developed healthcare system, which has contributed to a high life expectancy of 83.5 years. However, the population is also aging, with a median age of 43.1 years, which poses challenges for the pension system and the workforce. The population density is relatively high, with an average of 97.6 people per square kilometer, which can put pressure on infrastructure and services in urban areas.\n\nIn terms of regional distribution, the population is concentrated in the central and coastal regions, with the autonomous communities of Madrid, Catalonia, and Andalusia accounting for approximately 50% of the population. The rural population is declining, with many young people moving to urban areas in search of better job opportunities and education. This trend has resulted in a significant urban-rural divide, with rural areas facing challenges such as aging populations, limited access to services, and economic decline.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spanish | 89% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Catalan | 16% | Catalonia | Recognized as a national identity |\n| Basque | 2% | Basque Country | Distinct language and culture |\n| Galician | 2% | Galicia | Celtic roots and distinct language |\n| Roma | 1% | Nationwide | Minority group with significant social challenges |\n| Moroccan | 1% | Urban areas | Largest immigrant group |\n| Latin American | 1% | Urban areas | Significant immigrant community |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic landscape of Spain is characterized by a dominant Spanish ethnic group, which accounts for approximately 89% of the population. However, there are also significant regional identities, such as Catalan, Basque, and Galician, which are recognized and protected by the Spanish constitution. The Roma community is a minority group that faces significant social and economic challenges, while immigrant groups such as Moroccans and Latin Americans are also present in urban areas. The ethnic diversity of Spain is a result of its complex history, with various cultures and civilizations having influenced the country over the centuries.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Spanish** is the official language, spoken by approximately 99% of the population\n- Catalan is an official language in Catalonia, spoken by approximately 16% of the population\n- Basque is an official language in the Basque Country, spoken by approximately 2% of the population\n- Galician is an official language in Galicia, spoken by approximately 2% of the population\n- Arabic is spoken by the Moroccan immigrant community, with approximately 1% of the population speaking the language\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Catholicism | 68% | Dominant religion, with a significant decline in recent years |\n| Atheism/Agnosticism | 24% | Growing trend, particularly among young people |\n| Islam | 4% | Significant immigrant community, with a growing presence |\n| Protestantism | 2% | Small but significant community, with various denominations |\n| Judaism | 1% | Small but historic community, with a significant cultural impact |\n[/TABLE]\nThe dominant religion in Spain is Catholicism, with approximately 68% of the population identifying as Catholic.
