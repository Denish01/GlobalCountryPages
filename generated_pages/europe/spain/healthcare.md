[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Spanish healthcare system is a universal system, providing comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents, including foreigners who are registered with the system. The public healthcare system is primarily funded through taxes and social security contributions, and it provides access to a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. The quality of care in Spain is generally very high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have more specialized and better-equipped facilities.

In addition to the public healthcare system, there are also many private healthcare options available in Spain, including private hospitals and clinics. These private facilities often offer more personalized attention and shorter waiting times than public facilities, but they can be expensive. Many expats and medical tourists choose to use private healthcare facilities, either because they are not eligible for the public system or because they prefer the higher level of service.

The public healthcare system in Spain is decentralized, with each region responsible for its own healthcare services. This can result in some variations in the quality and availability of care between regions. However, overall, the Spanish healthcare system is considered to be one of the best in the world, with high patient satisfaction rates and good health outcomes.
