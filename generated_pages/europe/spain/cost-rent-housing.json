Typical lease terms in Spain are 12 months, although shorter-term leases are available for a higher premium. Deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent, and tenants have strong rights under Spanish law. The **Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos** (LAU) governs rental agreements, providing protections for tenants against unfair eviction and rent increases. Compared to its regional neighbors, Spain's housing costs are generally lower than those in France but higher than those in Portugal.\n\nThe Spanish housing market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by tourism and foreign investment. However, this growth has also led to concerns about **gentrification** and affordability, particularly in major cities. As a result, the Spanish government has implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Spain remains competitive, and renters should be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $800-$1,200 | $500-$800 | (typical quality, 25-40 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,500 | $600-$1,000 | (what to expect, 40-60 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,000 | $800-$1,400 | (family size, 60-90 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,800 | $1,200-$2,200 | (spacious, 90-120 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $4,000-$6,000 | (prime locations, e.g. Madrid's Salamanca district) |\n| Suburbs | $2,000-$3,500 | (residential areas, e.g. Madrid's Chamartin district) |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,000 | (if applicable, e.g. rural Andalusia) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Salamanca**: an upscale neighborhood in central Madrid, with typical rent ranges from $1,200 to $2,000 USD (€1,000 to €1,700 EUR) per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Malasaña**: a trendy neighborhood in central Madrid, with typical rent ranges from $1,000 to $1,800 USD (€850 to €1,500 EUR) per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Eixample**: a central neighborhood in Barcelona, with typical rent ranges from $1,200 to $2,200 USD (€1,000 to €1,900 EUR) per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Chamartin**: a residential neighborhood in northern Madrid, with typical rent ranges from $800 to $1,400 USD (€650 to €1,200 EUR) per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Gozque**: a suburban neighborhood in northern Madrid, with typical rent ranges from $600 to $1,000 USD (€500 to €850 EUR) per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Spain [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to avoid scams and find a suitable property.\n- Be prepared to act quickly when finding a property, as the rental market in Spain can be competitive.\n- Understand your rights as a tenant under the **Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos** (LAU).\n- Negotiate the price and terms of your rental agreement, as landlords may be willing to offer discounts or concessions.\n- Consider renting an unfurnished apartment, as this can often be cheaper than renting a furnished one.",
