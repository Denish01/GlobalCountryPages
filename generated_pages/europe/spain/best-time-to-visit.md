[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Spain is a diverse country with various climate zones, ranging from the Mediterranean coast to the Atlantic coast and the mountainous regions. The country can be divided into four main climate zones: the Mediterranean climate, the Atlantic climate, the continental climate, and the mountainous climate. The Mediterranean climate, which covers most of the country, is characterized by hot summers and mild winters, with most of the rainfall occurring during the winter months. The Atlantic climate, found in the north, is milder and wetter, with significant rainfall throughout the year. The continental climate, found in the central region, has cold winters and hot summers, while the mountainous climate is cold and snowy during the winter months.

The seasons in Spain have a significant impact on travel, with the summer months being the peak tourist season. The warm weather and school vacations make it an ideal time for families and sun-seekers to visit the beaches and popular tourist destinations. However, this also means that the prices for accommodations and tourist attractions are at their highest, and the crowds can be overwhelming. On the other hand, the spring and autumn months offer a more pleasant climate, with mild temperatures and fewer crowds, making it an ideal time for city breaks, hiking, and cultural activities.

The winter months, from December to February, are generally cooler and wetter, with some regions experiencing snowfall. While it may not be the best time to visit the beaches, it's an excellent time to explore the cities, visit museums, and enjoy the festive atmosphere. The winter season is also a great time to visit the ski resorts in the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada mountains.
