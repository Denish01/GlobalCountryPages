[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Spain is diverse, with several regional dialects and minority languages spoken across the country. Spanish, also known as **Castilian**, is the official language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population. However, there are also several recognized regional languages, including **Catalan**, **Basque**, and **Galician**, which are spoken in their respective autonomous communities. English is not as widely spoken as in other European countries, but it is still understood by many people, particularly in tourist areas and among the younger population. In general, English proficiency in Spain is considered **moderate**, with around 27% of the population able to converse in English.

Regional dialects in Spain can vary significantly, with distinct accents and vocabulary used in different parts of the country. For example, the dialect spoken in **Andalusia** is known for its unique pronunciation and slang, while the dialect spoken in **Catalonia** has been influenced by the region's history and cultural identity. Minority languages, such as **Arabic** and **Romanian**, are also spoken by immigrant communities in Spain.

Despite the prevalence of Spanish, English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population and in the service industry. Many Spaniards, particularly in the tourism sector, make an effort to speak English, and it is not uncommon to find English menus, signs, and brochures in popular tourist areas. However, it is still a good idea to learn some basic Spanish phrases to enhance your travel experience and show respect for the local culture.
