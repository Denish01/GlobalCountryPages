[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Ukraine has a well-developed public transportation system, with buses, trams, trolleybuses, and metro lines available in major cities. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Kyiv and other larger cities having more comprehensive and efficient systems. Most people in Ukraine get around using public transportation, with buses and marshrutkas (minibuses) being the most popular modes of transport. In smaller towns and rural areas, public transportation may be less frequent, and taxis or ride-hailing services may be more commonly used.

The country's transportation network is also influenced by its geography, with mountains and rivers affecting the route of roads and railways. As a result, travel times between cities can be significant, and the cost of transportation can vary greatly depending on the mode of transport and the route taken. Despite these challenges, Ukraine's transportation system is generally reliable and affordable, with many options available to suit different budgets and preferences.
