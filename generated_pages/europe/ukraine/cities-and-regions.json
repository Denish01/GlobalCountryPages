However, since 2014, Crimea has been under Russian control, and its status is disputed. Each oblast has its own capital city and is further divided into districts, known as raions. This structure allows for a degree of autonomy and regional governance, while also maintaining a strong central government in Kyiv. The oblasts are often grouped into larger regions, such as Eastern Ukraine, Western Ukraine, and Southern Ukraine, which can be useful for travelers and businesses looking to understand the country's geography and culture.\n\nThe administrative divisions in Ukraine have a long history, dating back to the Soviet era, and have undergone several changes since the country gained independence in 1991. Today, the oblasts and raions play an important role in providing local services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and are also responsible for promoting regional development and tourism. Understanding Ukraine's administrative structure can help visitors navigate the country and appreciate its diverse regions and cultures.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Kyiv** (population over 2.9 million)\nRole: capital and cultural center\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and world-class museums\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and business travelers\n\n**Kharkiv** (population over 1.4 million)\nRole: economic hub and educational center\nKnown For: its rich industrial heritage, prestigious universities, and lively nightlife\nBest For: students, entrepreneurs, and those interested in technology and innovation\n\n**Odessa** (population over 1 million)\nRole: port city and cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning architecture, vibrant arts scene, and rich cultural diversity\nBest For: beachgoers, foodies, and those interested in history and culture\n\n**Dnipro** (population over 1 million)\nRole: industrial and economic hub\nKnown For: its strategic location, rich history, and stunning natural scenery\nBest For: business travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, and those interested in history and industry\n\n**Lviv** (population over 700,000)\nRole: cultural center and tourist hub\nKnown For: its well-preserved historic architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and stunning natural surroundings\nBest For: tourists, history buffs, and those interested in culture and architecture\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Galicia | historic and cultural | medieval architecture, vibrant festivals | Lviv |\n| Volhynia | rural and scenic | rolling hills, picturesque villages | Lutsk |\n| Podolia | agricultural and industrial | rich soil, historic towns | Vinnytsia |\n| Central Ukraine | economic and cultural | historic cities, vibrant arts scene | Kyiv |\n| Eastern Ukraine | industrial and natural | coal mines, stunning scenery | Donetsk |\n| Southern Ukraine | coastal and tourist | beautiful beaches, historic ports | Odessa |\n| Crimea | autonomous and disputed | stunning coastline, historic landmarks | Simferopol |\n| Carpathian Ruthenia | mountainous and scenic | stunning natural beauty, traditional villages | Uzhhorod |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- Ukraine's regions differ significantly in terms of culture, with the western regions being more influenced by European traditions and the eastern regions having a stronger Russian influence.\n- The economy also varies by region, with the industrial east and agricultural west being major contributors to the country's GDP.\n- Climate is another factor that differs across regions, with the Carpathian Mountains being much cooler and more temperate than the coastal regions.\n- Language is also an important aspect of regional differences, with Ukrainian being the dominant language in the west and Russian being more widely spoken in the east.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nUkraine has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights connecting major cities, trains and buses providing affordable and convenient travel options, and a comprehensive road network that allows for easy driving. The country's rail network is one of the most extensive in Europe, with frequent trains connecting major cities and regional centers. Buses are also a popular mode of transportation, with many private companies operating routes across the country. For those who prefer to drive, Ukraine's roads are generally in good condition, although traffic in major cities can be heavy and chaotic. Additionally, Ukraine has several international airports, including Kyiv's Boryspil Airport, which offers connections to major European and global destinations.\n\nTraveling around Ukraine can be relatively easy and affordable, with many transportation options available to suit different budgets and preferences. However, it's worth noting that the country's transportation infrastructure is still developing, and some routes may be more convenient than others. Additionally, language barriers can be a challenge for travelers who don't speak Ukrainian or Russian, although many younger Ukrainians speak some English, and tourist information is often available in multiple languages. With some planning and research, visitors can easily navigate Ukraine's transportation network and explore the country's many regions and attractions.",
