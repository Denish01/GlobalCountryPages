# Ukraine Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Ukraine's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's transportation networks, energy sector, and telecommunications, although a notable urban-rural gap persists.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 73%
Road Network: 164,732 km, with 17% of roads in poor condition
Rail Network: 22,000 km
Major Airports: 15
Major Ports: 13
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Ukraine's infrastructure development level is generally moderate, with significant progress made in recent years to modernize the country's transportation networks, energy sector, and telecommunications. The government has invested heavily in improving the country's roads, railways, and airports, with a focus on increasing connectivity and trade with European countries. However, a notable urban-rural gap persists, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure such as paved roads, reliable electricity, and clean water. The country's infrastructure has also been affected by the ongoing conflict with Russia, which has damaged or destroyed significant portions of Ukraine's infrastructure, particularly in the eastern regions.

Despite these challenges, Ukraine has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing a number of initiatives aimed at improving the country's infrastructure and increasing economic growth. These initiatives include investments in renewable energy, improvements to the country's transportation networks, and efforts to increase access to basic infrastructure in rural areas. The European Union and other international organizations have also provided significant funding and support for Ukraine's infrastructure development, with a focus on promoting economic growth and stability in the region.

Ukraine's infrastructure is also being shaped by the country's strategic location, with the country serving as a key transit route for trade between Europe and Asia. The country's ports on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov are important hubs for international trade, with significant volumes of cargo passing through them each year. The country's infrastructure is also being developed with a focus on increasing energy independence, with significant investments made in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.
