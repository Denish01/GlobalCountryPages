# Ukraine Visa & Entry Requirements

Generally, citizens of certain countries can enter Ukraine without a visa, while others may need to obtain a visa on arrival or in advance, depending on the purpose and duration of their stay.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Ukraine before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Ukraine has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of over 60 countries to enter visa-free for tourism and business purposes. The country is a member of the European Union's Eastern Partnership program and has signed association agreements with the EU, which has led to the introduction of more liberal visa policies for EU citizens. Ukraine also offers e-visas for citizens of certain countries, making it easier for them to obtain a visa online.

The visa policy of Ukraine is designed to promote tourism, business, and cultural exchange, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free agreement with Ukraine can apply for a visa at the Ukrainian embassy or consulate in their home country, or in some cases, obtain a visa on arrival.
