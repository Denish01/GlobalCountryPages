[SECTION] How Ukraine Is Divided [/SECTION]
Ukraine's administrative structure is composed of 24 oblasts, which are similar to provinces, and one autonomous republic, Crimea. However, since 2014, Crimea has been under Russian control, and its status is disputed. Each oblast has its own capital city and is further divided into districts, known as raions. This structure allows for a degree of autonomy and regional governance, while also maintaining a strong central government in Kyiv. The oblasts are often grouped into larger regions, such as Eastern Ukraine, Western Ukraine, and Southern Ukraine, which can be useful for travelers and businesses looking to understand the country's geography and culture.

The administrative divisions in Ukraine have a long history, dating back to the Soviet era, and have undergone several changes since the country gained independence in 1991. Today, the oblasts and raions play an important role in providing local services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and are also responsible for promoting regional development and tourism. Understanding Ukraine's administrative structure can help visitors navigate the country and appreciate its diverse regions and cultures.
