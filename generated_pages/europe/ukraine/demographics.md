[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Ukraine has been declining over the past few decades, with a negative growth rate of approximately -0.5% per annum. This trend is largely due to a combination of low fertility rates, an aging population, and migration to other countries. The urban population accounts for around 69% of the total population, with the majority residing in cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa. Ukraine's population size is significant in the context of Eastern Europe, with the country ranking as one of the most populous in the region. However, the population decline poses significant challenges for the country's economy, social security system, and overall development.

Ukraine's population has been affected by migration patterns, with many young and educated individuals moving to other European countries in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards. This brain drain has resulted in a significant loss of human capital, which could have contributed to the country's economic growth and development. On the other hand, Ukraine has also experienced an influx of migrants from other post-Soviet countries, particularly from Central Asia and the Caucasus region.

The population of Ukraine is also characterized by a high level of regional diversity, with different regions exhibiting distinct cultural, linguistic, and economic characteristics. The western regions of Ukraine, such as Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk, tend to be more urbanized and have stronger economic ties with Europe, while the eastern regions, such as Donetsk and Luhansk, have historically been more industrialized and have closer economic links with Russia.
