The government has invested heavily in improving the country's roads, railways, and airports, with a focus on increasing connectivity and trade with European countries. However, a notable urban-rural gap persists, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure such as paved roads, reliable electricity, and clean water. The country's infrastructure has also been affected by the ongoing conflict with Russia, which has damaged or destroyed significant portions of Ukraine's infrastructure, particularly in the eastern regions.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ukraine has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing a number of initiatives aimed at improving the country's infrastructure and increasing economic growth. These initiatives include investments in renewable energy, improvements to the country's transportation networks, and efforts to increase access to basic infrastructure in rural areas. The European Union and other international organizations have also provided significant funding and support for Ukraine's infrastructure development, with a focus on promoting economic growth and stability in the region.\n\nUkraine's infrastructure is also being shaped by the country's strategic location, with the country serving as a key transit route for trade between Europe and Asia. The country's ports on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov are important hubs for international trade, with significant volumes of cargo passing through them each year. The country's infrastructure is also being developed with a focus on increasing energy independence, with significant investments made in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 164,732 km | Moderate | 17% of roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 22,000 km | Good | Electrified lines account for 45% of network |\n| Airports | 15 international, 20 domestic | Moderate | Major airports include Boryspil, Lviv, and Odessa |\n| Ports | 13 major | Good | Major ports include Odessa, Mykolaiv, and Mariupol |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Ukraine's power generation is primarily based on **thermal power plants**, which account for around 60% of the country's electricity production.\n- The country is also increasing its use of **renewable energy sources**, with significant investments made in wind and solar power in recent years.\n- **Nuclear power** also plays an important role in Ukraine's energy mix, with 15 reactors operating at four power plants.\n- The country's **energy grid** is generally reliable, although outages can occur, particularly during peak demand periods.\n- Ukraine has also made progress in increasing its **energy efficiency**, with a focus on reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of energy-efficient technologies.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in some areas of Ukraine, particularly in rural regions where water treatment facilities may be inadequate.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is generally good, with around 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** is also generally good, with around 95% of the population having access to improved water sources.\n- However, **water quality** can be a concern, particularly in areas where water sources may be polluted by industrial or agricultural activities.\n- The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving **water management** and increasing access to clean water and sanitation, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is generally good, with around 95% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic networks** are being developed, with a focus on increasing access to high-speed internet services.\n- **4G/5G rollout** is also underway, with a number of mobile operators offering high-speed mobile internet services.\n- **Postal services** are also available, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services operating across the country.\n- The government has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at increasing **digital literacy** and promoting the use of **information and communication technologies** (ICTs) in Ukraine.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Ukraine-EU Association Agreement** has provided significant funding and support for Ukraine's infrastructure development, with a focus on promoting economic growth and stability in the region.\n- The **European Bank for Reconstruction and Development** (EBRD) has also provided significant funding for infrastructure projects in Ukraine, including investments in the country's transportation networks and energy sector.\n- The **Ukrainian government** has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at increasing **private sector investment** in infrastructure, with a focus on promoting public-private partnerships and increasing access to funding for infrastructure projects.\n- The **World Bank** has also provided significant funding and support for infrastructure projects in Ukraine, including investments in the country's transportation networks, energy sector, and water and sanitation systems.\n- The **Ukraine 2030** development strategy has outlined a number of ambitious goals for the country's infrastructure development, including investments in renewable energy, improvements to the country's transportation networks, and efforts to increase access to basic infrastructure in rural areas.",
