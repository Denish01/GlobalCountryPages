[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Ukraine has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, with significant variations across different regions. The country can be divided into several climate zones, including the **temperate zone** in the north, the **continental zone** in the east, and the **Mediterranean zone** in the south. The dry season, which typically occurs from May to October, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, making it the best time to visit Ukraine's beaches and outdoor attractions. In contrast, the wet season, which occurs from November to April, is marked by cold and rainy weather, making it less ideal for outdoor activities.

The seasons in Ukraine also affect travel in various ways. During the peak season, popular tourist destinations like Kyiv, Lviv, and Odessa can get crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to increase. On the other hand, the budget season offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers. However, some tourist attractions and facilities may be closed or operate on reduced hours during the off-season.

Ukraine's climate and seasons also impact the country's festivals and events calendar. Many festivals and celebrations, such as the **Orthodox Easter** and **Ivan Kupala Day**, are tied to the country's rich cultural heritage and are often scheduled during the spring and summer months. Visitors can experience the country's vibrant culture and traditions by attending these events, which often feature traditional music, dance, and cuisine.
