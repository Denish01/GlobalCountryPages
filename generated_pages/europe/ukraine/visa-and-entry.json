[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nUkraine has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of over 60 countries to enter visa-free for tourism and business purposes. The country is a member of the European Union's Eastern Partnership program and has signed association agreements with the EU, which has led to the introduction of more liberal visa policies for EU citizens. Ukraine also offers e-visas for citizens of certain countries, making it easier for them to obtain a visa online.\n\nThe visa policy of Ukraine is designed to promote tourism, business, and cultural exchange, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free agreement with Ukraine can apply for a visa at the Ukrainian embassy or consulate in their home country, or in some cases, obtain a visa on arrival.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport or ID card |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Visa required | varies | Must apply at the Ukrainian embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Ukraine visa-free for up to 90 days, provided they have a valid passport and proof of onward travel.
