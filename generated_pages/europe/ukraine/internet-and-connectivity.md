The internet in Ukraine has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a notable increase in speed and coverage.

Despite these challenges, Ukraine's internet infrastructure is generally reliable, with most carriers offering a stable connection and a range of data plans to suit different needs and budgets.

In terms of internet quality, Ukraine ranks among the top countries in Eastern Europe, with an average download speed of 25 Mbps, which is sufficient for streaming, online gaming, and other data-intensive activities. However, it's worth noting that internet speeds can vary depending on the location and the carrier, so it's a good idea to research and compare different options before choosing a provider. Additionally, Ukraine has made significant progress in expanding its fiber-optic network, which has improved internet speeds and reliability in many areas.

Getting a SIM card in Ukraine is relatively straightforward, with a range of options available at airports, mobile shops, and kiosks.
