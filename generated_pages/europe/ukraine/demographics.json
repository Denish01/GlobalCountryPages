  "content": "The population of Ukraine is comprised of approximately 37 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a unique cultural landscape in Eastern Europe.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: (37.0 million)\nPopulation Growth Rate: (-0.5%)\nMedian Age: (41.3 years)\nUrban Population: (69%)\nPopulation Density: (61 per km2)\nLife Expectancy: (71.3 years)\nFertility Rate: (1.5 children per woman)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe population of Ukraine has been declining over the past few decades, with a negative growth rate of approximately -0.5% per annum. This trend is largely due to a combination of low fertility rates, an aging population, and migration to other countries. The urban population accounts for around 69% of the total population, with the majority residing in cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa. Ukraine's population size is significant in the context of Eastern Europe, with the country ranking as one of the most populous in the region. However, the population decline poses significant challenges for the country's economy, social security system, and overall development.\n\nUkraine's population has been affected by migration patterns, with many young and educated individuals moving to other European countries in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards. This brain drain has resulted in a significant loss of human capital, which could have contributed to the country's economic growth and development. On the other hand, Ukraine has also experienced an influx of migrants from other post-Soviet countries, particularly from Central Asia and the Caucasus region.\n\nThe population of Ukraine is also characterized by a high level of regional diversity, with different regions exhibiting distinct cultural, linguistic, and economic characteristics. The western regions of Ukraine, such as Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk, tend to be more urbanized and have stronger economic ties with Europe, while the eastern regions, such as Donetsk and Luhansk, have historically been more industrialized and have closer economic links with Russia.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ukrainian | 77.8% | Throughout the country | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Russian | 17.3% | Eastern and southern regions | Significant minority group |\n| Belarusian | 0.6% | Northern regions | Small minority group |\n| Romanian | 0.7% | Southwestern regions | Minority group with historical ties to Romania |\n| Polish | 0.3% | Western regions | Small minority group with historical ties to Poland |\n| Hungarian | 0.3% | Western regions | Small minority group with historical ties to Hungary |\n| Crimean Tatar | 0.5% | Crimea | Indigenous ethnic group with historical ties to the region |\n[/TABLE]\nUkraine's ethnic diversity is a significant aspect of its cultural landscape, with a range of ethnic groups contributing to the country's rich cultural heritage. The Ukrainian ethnic group is the dominant group, accounting for approximately 77.8% of the population, while the Russian ethnic group is the largest minority group, making up around 17.3% of the population. The relationships between different ethnic groups in Ukraine are generally harmonious, although there have been tensions and conflicts, particularly between the Ukrainian and Russian communities, in recent years.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Ukrainian** is the official language of Ukraine and is spoken by the majority of the population.\n- **Russian** is widely spoken, particularly in the eastern and southern regions, and is an important language for business and trade.\n- **English** is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among young people, as a lingua franca for international communication.\n- **Polish** and **Hungarian** are also spoken in certain regions, particularly in the western parts of the country.\n- **Crimean Tatar** is an endangered language spoken by the indigenous Crimean Tatar community in Crimea.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Orthodox Christianity | 65.4% | Dominant religion, with significant ties to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church |\n| Catholicism | 10.4% | Significant minority religion, with ties to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church |\n| Protestantism | 2.4% | Small but growing minority religion |\n| Islam | 0.6% | Minority religion, with significant ties to the Crimean Tatar community |\n| Judaism | 0.2% | Small minority religion, with historical ties to the Jewish community |\n[/TABLE]\nUkraine has a diverse range of religions, with Orthodox Christianity being the dominant faith.
