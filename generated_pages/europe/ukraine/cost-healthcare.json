  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Ukraine can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private healthcare services, with public services generally being more affordable but often with longer wait times and varying quality, while private services can be more expensive but offer better quality and shorter wait times.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $370 (2021)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 45.3% (2021)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 103\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: UAH\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nUkraine has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally free or low-cost for Ukrainian citizens, but the quality can vary significantly depending on the location and type of care. Private healthcare, on the other hand, is generally of higher quality but can be expensive. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it usually offers better quality and shorter wait times. However, it is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare, as out-of-pocket expenses can be high.\n\nThe Ukrainian healthcare system is generally well-organized, with a wide range of medical specialties and services available. However, the system can be bureaucratic, and wait times for public services can be long. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, often have shorter wait times and offer more personalized care. Many private hospitals and clinics in Ukraine have international accreditation and offer high-quality care, making them a popular choice for foreigners and wealthy Ukrainians. It is worth noting that some private healthcare providers may not accept local insurance, so it is essential to check the insurance options before seeking care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | Public clinics often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private specialists may require a referral |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private dental clinics often have modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | Public eye clinics may have limited equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-$10 | $10-$30 | Private labs often have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public ERs often have long wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals often have better amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | Private clinics often have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals often have better prenatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private clinics often have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Public clinics often have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public healthcare services, limited private care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Private healthcare services, including specialists and hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a Ukrainian doctor\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and some supermarkets\n- The cost of medication can vary significantly depending on the type and brand, with generic options often being cheaper\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for cash payments or loyalty programs\n- It is essential to check the expiration dates and packaging of medication before purchasing\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but some specialty medications may be harder to find\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 103, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Public hospitals often have emergency rooms, but the quality of care can vary. Private hospitals and clinics may also have emergency services, but these can be more expensive. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including their embassy and insurance provider.

These hospitals have international accreditation and offer high-quality care, including emergency services and specialized treatments. It is essential to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of transportation. Additionally, it is recommended to have a basic first aid kit and to know some basic Ukrainian phrases, such as \"допоможi\" (help) and \"госпіталь\" (hospital).",
