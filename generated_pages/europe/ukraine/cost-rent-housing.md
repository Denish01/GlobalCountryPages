[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Ukraine is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms in Ukraine are for 12 months, with a two-month deposit required upfront. Tenant rights are protected by law, and tenants are entitled to a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the lease. Ukraine's housing costs are generally lower compared to its regional neighbors, such as Poland and Hungary, but higher than in some of the other Eastern European countries, such as Belarus and Moldova. The housing market in Ukraine is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 6.5% affecting the cost of living and housing prices.

The Ukrainian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the housing market, including programs to support affordable housing and increase the availability of rental properties. Additionally, the country's education spend of 5.1% of GDP and health expenditure per capita of $370 have contributed to a relatively high standard of living, making Ukraine an attractive destination for expats and investors. However, the out-of-pocket health spend of 45.3% can be a significant burden for some individuals, and the housing market is not immune to the country's economic challenges.
