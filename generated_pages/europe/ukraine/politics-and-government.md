[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Ukraine is based on the principles of **separation of powers**, with the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial** branches each having distinct roles and responsibilities. The **President** serves as the head of state, while the **Prime Minister** is the head of government. The **Verkhovna Rada**, Ukraine's unicameral legislature, is composed of 450 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **Constitution of Ukraine**, adopted in 1996, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the branches.

The Ukrainian political system is characterized by a **unitary** structure, with a strong central government and limited regional autonomy. The country is divided into 24 **oblasts** (provinces), one **autonomous republic** (Crimea), and two **municipalities** (Kyiv and Sevastopol) with special status. While the central government retains significant authority, regional administrations have some degree of autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and local economic development.

The **separation of powers** in Ukraine is designed to prevent any one branch of government from dominating the others. The **executive** branch, led by the **President** and **Prime Minister**, is responsible for implementing laws and policies. The **legislative** branch, composed of the **Verkhovna Rada**, has the power to pass laws, approve the budget, and exercise parliamentary control over the government. The **judicial** branch, consisting of the **Constitutional Court** and other courts, is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring their conformity with the **Constitution**.
