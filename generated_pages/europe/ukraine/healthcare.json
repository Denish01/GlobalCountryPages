  "content": "Healthcare in Ukraine is a mixed system that offers a range of options for both locals and foreigners, with varying levels of quality and accessibility depending on the region and type of care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: [RATING] 3/5\nEmergency Number: 103\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nUkraine's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a significant portion of the population relying on public healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of decent quality, but it can be overcrowded and underfunded, especially in rural areas. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care but at a significantly higher cost. The quality of care can vary greatly depending on the region, with urban areas like Kyiv and Lviv tend to have better-equipped and staffed hospitals. In contrast, rural areas often struggle with limited access to medical facilities and specialized care.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has implemented various reforms to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a new healthcare financing model and the expansion of health insurance coverage. However, the system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, outdated equipment, and inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as maternal and child health, and the control of infectious diseases.\n\nThe healthcare system in Ukraine is also characterized by a strong tradition of **socialized medicine**, with a emphasis on preventive care and public health programs. However, the system can be bureaucratic and inefficient, with long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. Foreigners and expats may find it difficult to navigate the system, especially if they do not speak Ukrainian or Russian.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kyiv City Clinical Hospital | Kyiv | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Limited |\n| Feofaniya Clinical Hospital | Kyiv | Public | Neurology, neurosurgery, oncology | Limited |\n| Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital | Lviv | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Medikom Clinic | Kyiv | Private | General medicine, dentistry, cosmetic surgery | Yes |\n| International SOS Clinic | Kyiv | Private | General medicine, emergency care, travel medicine | Yes |\n| Dnipropetrovsk Regional Clinical Hospital | Dnipro | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it provides access to higher-quality care and covers a wider range of services.\n- **Local health insurance options** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as private insurance.\n- **Expats and foreigners** may be required to purchase private health insurance as a condition of their visa or residence permit.\n- **Costs** can vary greatly depending on the type and level of coverage, with basic plans starting from around 500 UAH (20 USD) per month.\n- **Group health insurance plans** are available for companies and organizations, and can provide a range of benefits and services.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors, as it can provide emergency medical coverage and evacuation services.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Ukraine, with a range of local and international brands available.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but many common medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Pharmacies** are widespread, with many locations open 24 hours a day.\n- **Common brands** include Ukrainian and Russian brands, as well as international brands like Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.\n- **Costs** can vary greatly depending on the type and brand of medication, but many medications are relatively affordable.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Ukraine.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be spending time in rural areas or working with animals.\n- **Tick-borne encephalitis** is a risk in some areas of Ukraine, especially during the summer months.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in some areas, with tap water not always being safe to drink.\n- **Food safety** is generally good, but travelers should still take precautions to avoid foodborne illness.\n- **Influenza** is a significant health risk in Ukraine, especially during the winter months.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Dental tourism** is a growing industry in Ukraine, with many clinics offering high-quality and affordable dental care.\n- **Cosmetic surgery** is also popular, with many clinics offering a range of procedures like breast augmentation and liposuction.\n- **Accredited hospitals** like the Medikom Clinic and the International SOS Clinic offer high-quality care and are popular with medical tourists.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many procedures costing 50-70% less than in Western Europe or North America.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, dial 103 to reach the emergency services.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can vary depending on the location, but most major cities have reliable ambulance services.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a mapping app like Google Maps.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed as soon as possible, with most insurance companies requiring documentation and receipts.\n- **Emergency care** is generally available, but the quality of care can vary greatly depending on the hospital and location.
