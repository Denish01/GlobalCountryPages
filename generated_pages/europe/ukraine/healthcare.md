[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Ukraine's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a significant portion of the population relying on public healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of decent quality, but it can be overcrowded and underfunded, especially in rural areas. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care but at a significantly higher cost. The quality of care can vary greatly depending on the region, with urban areas like Kyiv and Lviv tend to have better-equipped and staffed hospitals. In contrast, rural areas often struggle with limited access to medical facilities and specialized care.

The Ukrainian government has implemented various reforms to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a new healthcare financing model and the expansion of health insurance coverage. However, the system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, outdated equipment, and inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as maternal and child health, and the control of infectious diseases.

The healthcare system in Ukraine is also characterized by a strong tradition of **socialized medicine**, with a emphasis on preventive care and public health programs. However, the system can be bureaucratic and inefficient, with long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. Foreigners and expats may find it difficult to navigate the system, especially if they do not speak Ukrainian or Russian.
