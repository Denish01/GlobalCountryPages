[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Portugal has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system, known as the **National Health Service (SNS)**, provides universal access to healthcare for all citizens and is generally considered to be of high quality. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and the system is often overcrowded. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers faster access to medical services and is often preferred by those who can afford it. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of medical care, while foreigners may opt for private healthcare services or purchase health insurance to cover their medical expenses.

The Portuguese healthcare system is generally well-regarded, with a strong network of hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private facilities, as well as between urban and rural areas. For example, **private hospitals** in Lisbon and other major cities often have state-of-the-art equipment and highly trained staff, while public hospitals in rural areas may have more limited resources. Additionally, foreigners may face language barriers when navigating the public healthcare system, as not all medical professionals speak English. To overcome these challenges, it is recommended that foreigners purchase health insurance to cover their medical expenses and provide access to private healthcare services.
