[SECTION] How Portugal Is Divided [/SECTION]
Portugal is divided into 18 districts, which are further subdivided into municipalities and parishes. The country also has two autonomous regions, the Azores and Madeira, which are located in the Atlantic Ocean. The districts are the primary administrative divisions of Portugal, and each has its own capital city. The autonomous regions, on the other hand, have a greater degree of autonomy and are self-governing in many areas.

The administrative structure of Portugal is designed to provide a balance between central government control and regional autonomy. The districts are responsible for providing various public services, such as healthcare and education, while the autonomous regions have more control over their own affairs. This system allows for a degree of flexibility and adaptability, and has helped to promote economic and social development in different parts of the country.
