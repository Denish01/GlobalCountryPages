Typical lease terms range from 2 to 5 years, with a deposit requirement of 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect a certain level of maintenance and repair from landlords. Compared to its regional neighbors, Portugal's housing costs are relatively affordable, with prices lower than in Spain but higher than in some Eastern European countries. The country's housing market is also influenced by its popularity as a tourist destination, with many properties being used for short-term rentals, which can drive up prices in certain areas.\n\nThe Portuguese government has implemented measures to control rent increases and protect tenants, such as the \"Nova Lei do Arrendamento\" (New Rent Law), which limits annual rent increases to 5% and provides more rights to tenants. However, the law has also been criticized for not doing enough to address the country's housing affordability crisis, particularly in cities like Lisbon and Porto. As a result, many renters are looking for alternative options, such as shared apartments or houses outside of the city center.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $700-$1,000 | $500-$800 | small to medium size, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $900-$1,200 | $600-$900 | medium size, modern amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,200 | large size, family-friendly |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$1,800 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $3,500-$5,000 | prime locations, historic buildings |\n| Suburbs | $2,500-$3,500 | residential areas, modern amenities |\n| Rural | $1,500-$2,500 | countryside, traditional houses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Santos** in Lisbon: $1,000-$1,500 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, known for its nightlife and riverside views\n- **Chiado** in Lisbon: $1,200-$1,800 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, historic neighborhood with upscale shops and restaurants\n- **Vila Nova de Gaia** in Porto: $800-$1,200 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, popular with expats and young professionals\n- **Cascais** in Lisbon: $1,000-$1,500 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, coastal town with a relaxed atmosphere\n- **Boavista** in Porto: $900-$1,400 per month for a 1-bedroom apartment, upscale neighborhood with modern amenities\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Portugal [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find apartments and negotiate prices\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and first month's rent upfront\n- Utilities are usually not included in the rent, so factor in extra costs for electricity, water, and internet\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, especially for long-term rentals\n- Be aware of scams and always inspect the property before signing a lease\n- Consider learning some basic Portuguese phrases to help with communication and negotiation\n- Keep an eye on the local housing market and be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable apartment, as the rental market can be competitive.",
