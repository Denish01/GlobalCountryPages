Portugal has a lower GDP per capita than Spain, but also has a lower cost of living, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees. The economic context in both countries is similar, with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, but Portugal has been more successful in recent years in attracting foreign investment and promoting entrepreneurship.\n\nThe cost of living in Portugal is generally lower than in Spain, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being around 10-15% lower on average. This makes Portugal an attractive option for those looking to relocate to a European country with a warm climate and a high standard of living, but without the high prices of other Western European countries. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Lisbon and Porto in Portugal, and Madrid and Barcelona in Spain, being more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Portugal (USD) | Spain (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 600 | 800 | 25% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 400 | 550 | 27% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,000 | 1,400 | 29% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Portugal (USD) | Spain (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 12 | 17% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 350 | 14% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 2.50 | 20% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1.50 | 2 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Portugal (USD) | Spain (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 40 | 25% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.50 | 2 | 25% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.30 | 8% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Portugal (USD) | Spain (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 120 | 17% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 35 | 14% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 25 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Portugal (USD) | Spain (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 1,500 | 20% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,000 | 2,500 | 20% |\n| Comfortable | 3,000 | 3,800 | 21% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Portugal is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices being around 25-30% lower than in Spain\n- Food and dining, with meals at restaurants and groceries being around 15-20% cheaper\n- Transportation, with monthly transit passes and taxi fares being around 25% cheaper\n- Utilities and internet, with prices being around 15-20% lower\n- **Spain is cheaper for:**\n- Certain types of clothing and shoes, with prices being around 10-15% lower\n- Electronics and appliances, with prices being around 5-10% lower\n- Travel and tourism, with prices for flights and hotel stays being around 10-15% lower\n- Certain types of entertainment, such as movies and concerts, with prices being around 10-15% lower\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nPortugal and Spain are both excellent options for those looking to relocate to a European country with a warm climate and a high standard of living.
