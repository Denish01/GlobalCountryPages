[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Portuguese property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including a strong economy, a favorable tax regime, and a popular **Golden Visa** program that offers residency in exchange for property investment. The market is characterized by a mix of urban and rural areas, with the coastal regions and major cities tend to be more expensive than the inland areas. The price trajectory has been upward, with an average annual increase of around 5-7% in recent years. However, the market is expected to slow down in the coming years, with a more stable and sustainable growth rate.

The urban areas, particularly Lisbon and Porto, are popular with foreign investors and expats, who are attracted by the cities' vibrant cultural scenes, historic architecture, and modern amenities. The rural areas, on the other hand, offer a more relaxed pace of life, with a strong focus on agriculture and tourism. The **Algarve** region in southern Portugal is a popular destination for tourists and retirees, with a range of golf courses, beaches, and resorts.

The Portuguese government has implemented various measures to stimulate the property market, including tax incentives and subsidies for buyers. The **Non-Habitual Residency** (NHR) program, for example, offers a range of tax benefits, including a flat income tax rate of 20% and exemptions on foreign-sourced income. These measures have helped to attract foreign investment and stimulate the property market, particularly in the luxury segment.
