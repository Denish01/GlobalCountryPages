  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Portugal varies depending on the type of care and whether you choose public or private services, with an average health expenditure per capita of $2,971.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,971\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 28.2%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nPortugal has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system, known as the **National Health Service (SNS)**, provides universal access to healthcare for all citizens and is generally considered to be of high quality. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and the system is often overcrowded. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers faster access to medical services and is often preferred by those who can afford it. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of medical care, while foreigners may opt for private healthcare services or purchase health insurance to cover their medical expenses.\n\nThe Portuguese healthcare system is generally well-regarded, with a strong network of hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private facilities, as well as between urban and rural areas. For example, **private hospitals** in Lisbon and other major cities often have state-of-the-art equipment and highly trained staff, while public hospitals in rural areas may have more limited resources. Additionally, foreigners may face language barriers when navigating the public healthcare system, as not all medical professionals speak English. To overcome these challenges, it is recommended that foreigners purchase health insurance to cover their medical expenses and provide access to private healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: free or low-cost for citizens, private: varies by clinic |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Public: referral from GP required, private: direct access |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: limited services, private: comprehensive care |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: basic exam, private: comprehensive exam with advanced tests |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public: free or low-cost for citizens, private: varies by clinic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public: free or low-cost for citizens, private: varies by hospital |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Public: free or low-cost for citizens, private: varies by hospital |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Public: waiting list, private: immediate access |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Public: free or low-cost for citizens, private: varies by hospital |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public: waiting list, private: immediate access |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public: free or low-cost for citizens, private: varies by clinic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, basic medical care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, specialist care, hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, private healthcare services, emergency evacuation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers**, can cost between $5-$20 per prescription.\n- **Prescription medications** are generally available at pharmacies, but may require a doctor's prescription.\n- Pharmacies are widely available, with many locations in urban areas and smaller towns.\n- **Over-the-counter medications**, such as **cold and flu remedies**, can be purchased without a prescription.\n- Medication prices vary by pharmacy and location, with **private pharmacies** often charging more than **public pharmacies**.\n- Some medications, such as **specialized treatments**, may be more expensive or harder to find in Portugal.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial **112** to reach the emergency services. Ambulances are widely available, and emergency rooms are equipped to handle a range of medical situations. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek medical attention at a private hospital or clinic, as these facilities often have English-speaking staff and more comprehensive services. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Portugal include the **Hospital da Luz** in Lisbon and the **Hospital S. João** in Porto. These hospitals offer a range of medical services, including emergency care, and have English-speaking staff to assist with communication. Additionally, many private hospitals and clinics have **international patient departments**, which cater specifically to the needs of foreign patients.",
