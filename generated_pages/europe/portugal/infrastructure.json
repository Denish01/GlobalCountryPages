The country's strategic location on the Iberian Peninsula has made it an important hub for trade and commerce, with a well-developed network of roads, railways, airports, and ports. However, there is still a notable urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with urban areas generally having better access to services and amenities. Recent investments have focused on upgrading and expanding existing infrastructure, particularly in the areas of renewable energy and digital connectivity.\n\nThe Portuguese government has implemented various initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the **National Infrastructure Plan**, which aims to invest in key sectors such as transportation, energy, and telecommunications. This plan has helped to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth, with a focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly development. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to reduce the urban-rural gap, such as investing in rural broadband and improving access to public transportation.\n\nPortugal's infrastructure development has also been driven by its membership in the European Union, which has provided access to funding and expertise. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as energy efficiency, water management, and waste management. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need to upgrade and expand existing infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing population and economy.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 82,900 km | Good | Well-maintained and extensive network, with a focus on safety and efficiency |\n| Railways | 2,786 km | Moderate | Network is being upgraded and expanded, with a focus on high-speed rail |\n| Airports | 3 international, 5 domestic | Good | Major airports include Lisbon Portela, Porto Francisco Sá Carneiro, and Faro |\n| Ports | 5 major | Good | Major ports include Leixões, Lisbon, and Sines, with a focus on cargo and passenger traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Portugal generates most of its electricity from **renewable energy sources**, including hydro, wind, and solar power, with a target of 59% of electricity generation coming from renewables by 2030.\n- The country has made significant progress in reducing its dependence on fossil fuels, with a focus on energy efficiency and sustainability.\n- The power grid is generally reliable, with few outages and a strong focus on maintenance and upgrading.\n- Portugal is also investing in **smart grid** technology, with a focus on improving energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption.\n- The country has set a target of becoming **carbon neutral** by 2050, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is safe to drink in Portugal, with a high level of quality and treatment.\n- Sanitation coverage is almost universal, with 99% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- Water access is also widespread, with 100% of the population having access to improved water sources.\n- Portugal has made significant progress in reducing water pollution, with a focus on wastewater treatment and environmental protection.\n- The country is also investing in **water conservation** measures, with a focus on reducing water waste and promoting efficient use of this resource.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is extensive in Portugal, with 99% of the population having access to mobile networks.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is widely available, with a focus on high-speed internet access and digital connectivity.\n- The country has made significant progress in rolling out **4G and 5G networks**, with a focus on improving mobile broadband speeds and capacity.\n- **Postal services** are also well-developed, with a focus on efficient and reliable delivery of mail and packages.\n- Portugal has set a target of achieving **universal broadband coverage** by 2025, with a focus on promoting digital inclusion and reducing the digital divide.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Portuguese government is investing in a number of major infrastructure projects, including the **Lisbon Metro expansion** and the **Porto-Sines high-speed rail line**.\n- The country is also upgrading its **road network**, with a focus on improving safety and efficiency.\n- Portugal is investing in **renewable energy projects**, including wind and solar power, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.\n- The country is also developing its **tourism infrastructure**, with a focus on improving amenities and services for visitors.\n- The **European Union** is providing funding and support for a number of infrastructure projects in Portugal, with a focus on promoting economic growth and development.",
