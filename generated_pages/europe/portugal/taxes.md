[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Portugal operates a **territorial taxation** system, which means that residents are taxed on their Portuguese-sourced income, while non-residents are taxed only on income derived from Portuguese sources. To be considered a tax resident in Portugal, an individual must have a **habitual residence** in the country, which is typically determined by physical presence for more than 183 days in a calendar year, or having a dwelling in Portugal that is deemed to be their habitual residence. Tax residents are also required to register with the Portuguese tax authorities and obtain a tax identification number.

The Portuguese tax system is designed to encourage foreign investment and talent, with a range of incentives and exemptions available to expats and foreign workers. The **Non-Habitual Residency (NHR) regime**, for example, provides a special tax status for foreign nationals who become tax residents in Portugal, offering a range of benefits including a flat income tax rate of 20% and exemption from taxation on foreign-sourced income. To qualify for the NHR regime, individuals must meet certain conditions, including not having been a tax resident in Portugal in the previous five years, and must apply for the regime within six months of becoming a tax resident in Portugal.
