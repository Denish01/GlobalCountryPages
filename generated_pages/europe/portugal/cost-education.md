[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Portugal is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being generally considered to be of high quality and free or subsidized for local students. The language of instruction is Portuguese, and compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 5 to 17. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Lisbon and Porto, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British GCSEs. These schools cater to expat families and offer a more diverse and globalized education experience.

The quality of education in Portugal is considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, as well as languages and humanities. The public education system is well-funded, with 4.5% of GDP allocated to education, and the literacy rate is around 95.4%. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more personalized and often bilingual education experience, but at a higher cost. International schools offer a range of curricula and are a popular choice for expat families, but can be very expensive, with annual fees ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 or more.
