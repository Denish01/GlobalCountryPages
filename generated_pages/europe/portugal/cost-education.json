The language of instruction is Portuguese, and compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 5 to 17. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Lisbon and Porto, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British GCSEs. These schools cater to expat families and offer a more diverse and globalized education experience.\n\nThe quality of education in Portugal is considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, as well as languages and humanities. The public education system is well-funded, with 4.5% of GDP allocated to education, and the literacy rate is around 95.4%. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more personalized and often bilingual education experience, but at a higher cost.
