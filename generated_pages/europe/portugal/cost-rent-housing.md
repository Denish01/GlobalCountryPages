[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Portugal's rental market is relatively stable, with a moderate level of demand and supply. Typical lease terms range from 2 to 5 years, with a deposit requirement of 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect a certain level of maintenance and repair from landlords. Compared to its regional neighbors, Portugal's housing costs are relatively affordable, with prices lower than in Spain but higher than in some Eastern European countries. The country's housing market is also influenced by its popularity as a tourist destination, with many properties being used for short-term rentals, which can drive up prices in certain areas.

The Portuguese government has implemented measures to control rent increases and protect tenants, such as the "Nova Lei do Arrendamento" (New Rent Law), which limits annual rent increases to 5% and provides more rights to tenants. However, the law has also been criticized for not doing enough to address the country's housing affordability crisis, particularly in cities like Lisbon and Porto. As a result, many renters are looking for alternative options, such as shared apartments or houses outside of the city center.
