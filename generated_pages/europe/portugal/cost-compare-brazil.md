As a result, the cost of living in Portugal is generally lower than in Brazil, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees. The difference in cost of living between the two countries can be attributed to various factors, including the cost of housing, food, transportation, and utilities.

The cost of living in Portugal is around 20-30% lower than in Brazil, with significant differences in the cost of housing, food, and transportation.
