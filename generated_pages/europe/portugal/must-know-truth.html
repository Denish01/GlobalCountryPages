        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Portugal has a rich and complex history that spans over 800 years. The country was founded in 1139, when <strong>Afonso Henriques</strong> declared himself the first King of Portugal, marking the beginning of the <strong>Portuguese Kingdom</strong>. Prior to this, the region was inhabited by various tribes, including the <strong>Celts</strong>, <strong>Romans</strong>, and <strong>Moors</strong>. In 1385, Portugal signed the <strong>Treaty of Windsor</strong> with England, establishing a long-lasting alliance between the two countries. The <strong>Age of Exploration</strong> in the 15th and 16th centuries saw Portugal establish a vast colonial empire, with territories in <strong>Africa</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong>, and <strong>South America</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Portuguese Empire</strong> reached its peak in the 16th century, with the country controlling a significant portion of the world's trade routes. However, the empire began to decline in the 17th and 18th centuries, due to various factors, including the <strong>Dutch-Portuguese War</strong> and the <strong>War of the Spanish Succession</strong>. In 1755, a devastating <strong>earthquake</strong> struck Lisbon, killing thousands and destroying much of the city. The 19th and 20th centuries saw Portugal undergo significant changes, including the <strong>Liberal Wars</strong> and the <strong>Carnation Revolution</strong>, which led to the establishment of a democratic government.</p>
        <p>Portugal's independence was officially recognized in 1668, with the <strong>Treaty of Lisbon</strong>, which ended the <strong>Spanish-Portuguese War</strong>. The country has since maintained its independence, with the exception of a brief period of <strong>Spanish rule</strong> from 1580 to 1640. Today, Portugal is a <strong>sovereign state</strong>, with a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> and a <strong>presidential system</strong>. The country is a member of the <strong>European Union</strong>, the <strong>NATO</strong>, and the <strong>United Nations</strong>, and has a strong economy and a high standard of living.</p>
        <p>In terms of classification, Portugal is a <strong>developed country</strong>, with a <strong>high-income economy</strong> and a <strong>human development index</strong> of 0.866, ranking 25th in the world. The country has a <strong>mixed economy</strong>, with a strong service sector, a significant industrial sector, and a smaller agricultural sector. Portugal is also a <strong>member of the Eurozone</strong>, using the <strong>Euro</strong> as its official currency.</p>
