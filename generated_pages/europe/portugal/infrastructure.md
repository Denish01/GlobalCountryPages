[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Portugal's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with major investments in transportation, energy, and telecommunications. The country's strategic location on the Iberian Peninsula has made it an important hub for trade and commerce, with a well-developed network of roads, railways, airports, and ports. However, there is still a notable urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with urban areas generally having better access to services and amenities. Recent investments have focused on upgrading and expanding existing infrastructure, particularly in the areas of renewable energy and digital connectivity.

The Portuguese government has implemented various initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the **National Infrastructure Plan**, which aims to invest in key sectors such as transportation, energy, and telecommunications. This plan has helped to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth, with a focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly development. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to reduce the urban-rural gap, such as investing in rural broadband and improving access to public transportation.

Portugal's infrastructure development has also been driven by its membership in the European Union, which has provided access to funding and expertise. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in areas such as energy efficiency, water management, and waste management. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including the need to upgrade and expand existing infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing population and economy.
