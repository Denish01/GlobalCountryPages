  "content": "The population of Portugal is comprised of approximately 10.3 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a unique and culturally rich country in Europe.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 10.3 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.2%\nMedian Age: 42.7 years\nUrban Population: 63.4%\nPopulation Density: 116 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 82.7 years\nFertility Rate: 1.23 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nPortugal's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but its growth trends have been steadily increasing over the years. The country has experienced a significant decline in population growth rate due to low fertility rates and an aging population. However, urbanization has been on the rise, with many people moving to cities such as Lisbon and Porto in search of better job opportunities and living standards. Migration patterns have also played a significant role in shaping Portugal's population, with many foreigners moving to the country for work or retirement. The country has a relatively high life expectancy and low infant mortality rate, indicating a high standard of living and access to quality healthcare.\n\nThe population of Portugal is also characterized by a significant aging population, with a high percentage of people over the age of 65. This has significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social security. The government has implemented various policies to address these challenges, including increasing the retirement age and encouraging immigration to boost the workforce. Despite these challenges, Portugal remains a popular destination for tourists and expats, with its rich culture, beautiful landscapes, and mild climate.\n\nIn recent years, Portugal has experienced a significant increase in immigration, particularly from other European countries and Brazil. This has contributed to the country's population growth and has helped to mitigate the effects of an aging population. However, it has also presented challenges, such as integrating new arrivals into Portuguese society and providing them with access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Portuguese | 95% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Brazilian | 2% | Urban areas | Large immigrant community |\n| African | 1% | Urban areas | Mainly from former colonies |\n| Asian | 1% | Urban areas | Mainly from China and India |\n| Roma | 0.5% | Nationwide | Minority ethnic group |\n[/TABLE]\nPortugal is a culturally diverse country, with a range of ethnic groups contributing to its population.
