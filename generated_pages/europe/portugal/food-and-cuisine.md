[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Portuguese cuisine is defined by its rich history, cultural influences, and geographical location. The country's strategic position on the Atlantic coast has made it a hub for trade and cultural exchange, resulting in a unique blend of Mediterranean, Atlantic, and African flavors. The **Mediterranean diet** is a significant influence on Portuguese cuisine, with a focus on olive oil, garlic, and fresh vegetables. Regional variations are also notable, with the north known for its **caldo verde**, a hearty soup made with potatoes, kale, and sausage, while the south is famous for its **cataplana**, a fish stew cooked in a copper pot.

Portuguese cuisine is also characterized by its use of **bacalhau**, or dried cod, which is a staple ingredient in many traditional dishes. The country's colonial past has also left a lasting impact on its cuisine, with many African and Asian flavors incorporated into traditional dishes. The **Age of Discovery** brought new spices, ingredients, and cooking techniques to Portugal, which were quickly adopted and incorporated into the local cuisine.

From the rugged coastline to the rolling hills of the interior, Portugal's diverse landscape has given rise to a wide range of local specialties and traditional dishes. The country's strong culinary identity is reflected in its many **festas** and **feiras**, or festivals and fairs, which celebrate local food, wine, and culture. Whether it's the **Festa de Santo António** in Lisbon or the **Festa do Avante** in the north, these events showcase the best of Portuguese cuisine and hospitality.
