[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Albania's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with the government investing heavily in the construction of new roads, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, the country still faces challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation can be limited. The urban-rural gap is significant, with cities like Tirana and Durres enjoying relatively good infrastructure, while rural areas often lack basic services. Despite these challenges, Albania has made significant progress in recent years, with the country's infrastructure now considered to be among the most developed in the region.

The government has implemented several initiatives aimed at improving the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new highways and the rehabilitation of existing roads. Additionally, Albania has made significant investments in the energy sector, with a focus on increasing the use of renewable energy sources such as hydro and solar power. The country has also invested in the development of its telecommunications sector, with several major operators providing mobile and internet services.

Albania's infrastructure development has been supported by international organizations such as the European Union and the World Bank, which have provided funding and technical assistance for several major projects. The country's strategic location in Southeastern Europe also makes it an important transit point for trade and commerce, with several major transportation corridors passing through its territory.
