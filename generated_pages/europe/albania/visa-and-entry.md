# Albania Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Albania before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Albania has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of over 80 countries to enter the country without a visa. The country is a member of the European Union's visa liberalization program, which enables citizens of certain countries to visit Albania visa-free for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. The visa policy is designed to promote tourism and economic development, making it easier for visitors to explore the country's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty.

Albania's visa policy is divided into several categories, including visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas. Citizens of countries that do not require a visa can enter Albania with a valid passport and stay for up to 90 days. Those who require a visa on arrival can obtain one at the airport or border crossing, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance through the Albanian embassy or consulate in their home country.
