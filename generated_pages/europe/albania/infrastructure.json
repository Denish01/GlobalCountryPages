  "content": "The infrastructure in Albania is developing, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications, although challenges persist, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 66%\nRoad Network: 18,000 km, with varying quality\nRail Network: 447 km\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 5\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nAlbania's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with the government investing heavily in the construction of new roads, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, the country still faces challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation can be limited. The urban-rural gap is significant, with cities like Tirana and Durres enjoying relatively good infrastructure, while rural areas often lack basic services. Despite these challenges, Albania has made significant progress in recent years, with the country's infrastructure now considered to be among the most developed in the region.\n\nThe government has implemented several initiatives aimed at improving the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new highways and the rehabilitation of existing roads. Additionally, Albania has made significant investments in the energy sector, with a focus on increasing the use of renewable energy sources such as hydro and solar power. The country has also invested in the development of its telecommunications sector, with several major operators providing mobile and internet services.\n\nAlbania's infrastructure development has been supported by international organizations such as the European Union and the World Bank, which have provided funding and technical assistance for several major projects. The country's strategic location in Southeastern Europe also makes it an important transit point for trade and commerce, with several major transportation corridors passing through its territory.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 18,000 km | Moderate | Many roads are in poor condition, particularly in rural areas |\n| Railways | 447 km | Poor | Rail network is limited and in need of modernization |\n| Airports | 4 international, 1 domestic | Good | Major airports are well-equipped and modern |\n| Ports | 5 major | Moderate | Ports are important for trade and commerce, but require modernization |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Albania's power generation is primarily based on **hydroelectric power**, which accounts for over 90% of the country's electricity production.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing its energy independence, with several new power plants and transmission lines constructed in recent years.\n- However, the energy sector still faces challenges, including **power outages** and **transmission losses**, which can be significant, particularly during peak summer months.\n- Albania has set ambitious targets for increasing the use of **renewable energy sources**, including wind and solar power, and has implemented several initiatives to support the development of these technologies.\n- The country's energy sector is regulated by the **Energy Regulatory Authority**, which is responsible for overseeing the development of the energy market and ensuring the reliability and safety of the energy system.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in some areas, particularly in rural regions where water treatment facilities may be limited.\n- Albania has made significant progress in increasing **sanitation coverage**, with over 90% of the population now having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- However, **water access** remains a challenge in some rural areas, where residents may rely on wells or other traditional sources of water.\n- The government has implemented several initiatives aimed at improving water and sanitation services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure.\n- **Water conservation** is also a priority, with the country facing significant challenges related to drought and water scarcity, particularly during summer months.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Albania has a well-developed **mobile network**, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile services.\n- The country has also made significant progress in increasing **fiber and broadband penetration**, with several major operators providing high-speed internet services.\n- **4G and 5G rollout** is ongoing, with several major operators having launched commercial services in recent years.\n- Albania's **postal services** are provided by the national postal operator, which offers a range of services, including mail delivery and parcel shipping.\n- The country's telecommunications sector is regulated by the **Electronic and Postal Communications Authority**, which is responsible for overseeing the development of the sector and ensuring the quality and reliability of services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Albanian government has launched several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of a new **highway** connecting the capital city of Tirana to the port city of Durres.\n- The country is also investing in the development of its **energy sector**, with several new power plants and transmission lines planned or under construction.\n- Albania has received significant funding from international organizations such as the **European Union** and the **World Bank** to support the development of its infrastructure.\n- The country is also participating in several major regional initiatives, including the **Trans-Adriatic Pipeline** project, which will transport natural gas from Azerbaijan to Italy.\n- The government has set ambitious targets for increasing the use of **renewable energy sources**, and has implemented several initiatives to support the development of these technologies, including the construction of new wind and solar farms.",
