  "content": "The population of Albania is approximately 2.8 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that contribute to the country's unique cultural identity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 2.8 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.3%\nMedian Age: 34 years\nUrban Population: 60%\nPopulation Density: 82 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 78 years\nFertility Rate: 1.8 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nAlbania's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but it has experienced significant growth trends over the past few decades. The population has been increasing at a slow rate, with an average annual growth rate of 0.3%. Urbanization has been a major factor in the country's demographic changes, with approximately 60% of the population living in urban areas. The capital city, Tirana, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 400,000 people. Migration patterns have also played a significant role in shaping Albania's population, with many young people leaving the country in search of better economic opportunities abroad.\n\nThe population of Albania is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to a combination of factors such as improvements in healthcare, education, and economic development. However, the country also faces significant challenges related to migration, with many young and educated individuals leaving the country in search of better opportunities. This has resulted in a brain drain, which can have negative impacts on the country's economic and social development.\n\nAlbania's population is also characterized by a relatively low fertility rate, with an average of 1.8 children per woman. This is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman, which is necessary to maintain a stable population. As a result, the country's population is expected to age significantly in the coming decades, with a growing proportion of older people and a declining proportion of young people.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Albanians | 95% | Throughout the country | The dominant ethnic group in Albania |\n| Greeks | 3% | Southern regions | Recognized minority group with their own language and cultural traditions |\n| Macedonians | 1% | Eastern regions | Small minority group with their own language and cultural traditions |\n| Roma | 0.5% | Throughout the country | Minority group with their own language and cultural traditions |\n| Montenegrins | 0.2% | Northern regions | Small minority group with their own language and cultural traditions |\n| Aromanians | 0.1% | Southern regions | Small minority group with their own language and cultural traditions |\n[/TABLE]\nAlbania is a diverse country with a range of ethnic groups, each with their own language, culture, and traditions.
