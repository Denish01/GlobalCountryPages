Albania has a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy, which translates to lower prices for goods and services. Greece, on the other hand, has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which comes with higher costs. Overall, Albania offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, transportation, and utilities. However, Greece offers a more developed infrastructure, a richer cultural heritage, and a more vibrant tourism industry, which may be worth the extra cost for some individuals.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Albania has a growing economy, with a focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, while Greece has a more diversified economy, with a strong services sector and a significant tourism industry. The cost of living in Albania is also influenced by its proximity to Italy and other European countries, which has led to an increase in trade and investment. In contrast, Greece has a more developed economy, with a strong focus on services and tourism, which has driven up prices for goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Albania (USD) | Greece (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $400 | 50% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $300 | 50% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $800 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Albania (USD) | Greece (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $10 | $15 | 33% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $300 | $500 | 40% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1.50 | $2.50 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Albania (USD) | Greece (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1.50 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Albania (USD) | Greece (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Albania (USD) | Greece (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $600 | $1,000 | 40% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,500 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | $1,500 | $2,500 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Albania is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices that are 50% lower than in Greece\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries that are 30-40% cheaper\n  - Transportation, with lower prices for taxis, fuel, and public transportation\n  - Utilities and internet, with lower prices for electricity, water, and mobile plans\n- **Greece is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain imported goods, such as electronics and clothing, which may be cheaper due to Greece's EU membership\n  - High-end tourism services, such as luxury hotels and resorts, which may be more developed in Greece\n  - Certain types of healthcare services, which may be more advanced and affordable in Greece\n  - Education, with a more developed and recognized education system\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Albania offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, transportation, and utilities.
