        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Albania, a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in <strong>Europe</strong>, has a rich and complex history that spans over 2,000 years. The territory that is now Albania was inhabited by the <strong>Illyrians</strong> in the 8th century BC. The region was later conquered by the <strong>Romans</strong> in 168 BC, and it remained under Roman rule until the 4th century AD. In the Middle Ages, Albania was invaded by various tribes, including the <strong>Slavs</strong> and the <strong>Normans</strong>. The <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> conquered Albania in the 14th century, and it remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 500 years.</p>
        <p>The modern Albanian state was established on November 28, 1912, when Albania declared its <strong>independence</strong> from the Ottoman Empire. The country's early years were marked by political instability and conflict, including a brief period of <strong>Italian occupation</strong> during World War I. In 1939, Albania was invaded by <strong>Italy</strong>, and it remained under Italian and then <strong>German occupation</strong> until the end of World War II. After the war, Albania became a <strong>communist state</strong> under the leadership of <strong>Enver Hoxha</strong>, who ruled the country from 1944 until his death in 1985.</p>
        <p>Albania's transition to a <strong>democratic government</strong> began in the early 1990s, after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. The country held its first <strong>multi-party elections</strong> in 1992, and it has since become a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong>. Albania has been a member of the <strong>United Nations</strong> since 1955 and has been a member of <strong>NATO</strong> since 2009. The country has also been a candidate for <strong>European Union</strong> membership since 2014.</p>
        <p>Albania's history has been shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of <strong>Europe</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong>, and <strong>Africa</strong>. The country's unique cultural heritage reflects its complex history, with influences from the <strong>Illyrians</strong>, <strong>Romans</strong>, <strong>Ottomans</strong>, and other civilizations. Today, Albania is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> with a population of approximately 2.8 million people, and it continues to navigate its relationships with its neighbors and the wider world.</p>
