[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Albania is easily accessible by air, with Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza (TIA) serving as the main entry point for international flights. The airport is located about 15 kilometers northwest of Tirana's city center and offers connections to major European cities, including London, Frankfurt, and Rome. You can also enter Albania by land from neighboring countries, including Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and Greece, with several border crossings available along the main highways. The most popular overland entry points are the Morinë border crossing from Kosovo, the Qafë Botë border crossing from Greece, and the Hani i Hotit border crossing from Montenegro.

If you're planning to travel to Albania by bus, you can take advantage of the country's well-developed network of international bus connections, with companies like FlixBus and Eurolines operating routes from major European cities. Alternatively, you can take a ferry from Italy to the port city of Vlorë or Sarandë, with several operators offering daily sailings during the summer months. Whichever mode of transport you choose, be sure to check the latest entry requirements and any necessary documentation before your trip.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Albania has a limited domestic air network, with only a few flights available between Tirana and other major cities like Vlorë and Sarandë. The main domestic airline is **Adriatic Airways**, which operates a small fleet of aircraft and offers regular flights to several destinations around the country. You can book domestic flights online or through a local travel agency, with prices starting from around $50-$100 USD for a one-way ticket. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be subject to change or cancellation, especially during the off-season, so be sure to check the latest schedules and prices before your trip.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Albania's rail network is limited, with only a few routes available between major cities like Tirana, Durrës, and Vlorë. The **Hekurudha Shqiptare** (Albanian Railways) operates a small fleet of trains, with services running several times a day. However, the rail network is not well-developed, and trains are often slow and unreliable. There are no high-speed options available, and the booking process can be complicated, with tickets often only available for purchase at the station. If you do decide to take the train, be prepared for a scenic but bumpy ride, with stunning views of the Albanian countryside.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses and coaches are a popular way to get around Albania, with several companies operating routes between major cities and towns. **FlixBus** and **Eurolines** are two of the main operators, offering comfortable and affordable services to destinations around the country. You can book tickets online or at the bus station, with prices starting from around $5-$20 USD for a one-way ticket. The bus network is well-developed, with frequent services available throughout the day, although the quality of the buses can vary depending on the operator and route.
