Tenant rights are protected by law, but it's essential to have a written contract and negotiate the terms before signing. Albania's housing costs are generally lower compared to its regional neighbors, such as Greece and Montenegro, but higher than in Kosovo and North Macedonia. The country's **inflation rate** of 2.2% and **GDP per capita** of $27,146 indicate a relatively stable economy, which has a positive impact on the housing market.\n\nThe Albanian housing market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a growing trend towards modern apartments and complexes. However, the market is not highly regulated, and some properties may not meet international standards. It's crucial for renters to inspect the property carefully and negotiate the terms of the lease before signing. Additionally, some areas in Tirana and other cities are undergoing **urban renewal** projects, which may affect housing prices and availability in the long term. The **education spend** of 3.1% of GDP and **health expenditure per capita** of $591 indicate a relatively low investment in public services, which may impact the overall quality of life in Albania.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$250 | $100-$200 | small, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$350 | $150-$300 | typical quality, furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $250-$450 | family size, modern amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $350-$600 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$2,500 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, older buildings |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | rural areas, traditional houses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Blloku**: a trendy neighborhood in the heart of Tirana, with modern apartments and a vibrant nightlife, rent range $200-$500 USD per month\n- **Pazari i Ri**: a historic neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, close to the city center, rent range $150-$350 USD per month\n- **Kombinat**: a residential area with a range of apartment options, including modern complexes, rent range $100-$300 USD per month\n- **Lapraka**: a suburban area with a more relaxed atmosphere, rent range $80-$250 USD per month\n- **Xhafzotaj**: a coastal neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $150-$400 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Albania [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and neighborhoods before starting your search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable apartment\n- Inspect the property carefully and negotiate the terms of the lease before signing\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and first month's rent in advance\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and internet are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are more common in Albania, but it's possible to find unfurnished options, especially in the suburbs\n- [CALLOUT] Be cautious of scams and always verify the ownership and documentation of the property before signing a lease\n- [RATING] Albania's rent affordability: 4/5",
