  "content": "In Albania, healthcare costs vary significantly between public and private facilities, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for nearly half of the total healthcare expenditure per capita, which stands at $591.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $591 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 48.3% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: ALL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nAlbania's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with public facilities generally offering lower-cost services, but often with longer wait times and varying quality. The public healthcare system is universal, covering all citizens, but the quality of care can be inconsistent, especially in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance, as public facilities may not always have English-speaking staff or the latest medical equipment. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality services, often with English-speaking staff, but at a significantly higher cost. Locals often rely on public facilities for routine care, while opting for private facilities for more complex or specialized treatments.\n\nThe Albanian healthcare system is generally well-organized, with a clear distinction between public and private providers. However, the system can be complex, and navigating it as a foreigner may require some effort. It is essential to have a basic understanding of the system, including the types of services available, the costs involved, and the requirements for insurance. While public facilities are generally more affordable, private facilities offer a more comprehensive range of services, often with shorter wait times and more modern equipment. As a result, many foreigners opt for private health insurance, which can provide access to a wider range of services and facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public facilities may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private facilities often have more specialized services |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dentists may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public facilities may not have the latest equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public facilities may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private facilities may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private facilities often have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private facilities may offer more comprehensive prenatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Private facilities may have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public facilities may have longer wait times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public facilities, basic services, and emergency care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Private facilities, specialized services, and more comprehensive care |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Global coverage, including Albania, with access to private facilities and specialized services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications like **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-$10 per prescription\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available, but may require a doctor's prescription from a licensed Albanian physician\n- Pharmacies are **readily available** in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are available in most pharmacies, but may not always be labeled in English\n- **Vaccinations** are widely available, but may require a doctor's prescription or consultation\n- **Medication prices** can vary significantly between public and private pharmacies, with private pharmacies often charging more\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the **emergency number** 112, which will connect you with emergency services.
