        <h2>How Albania Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Albania is divided into 12 counties, also known as <strong>prefectures</strong>, which are further divided into 61 municipalities. The counties are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and each has its own capital and local government.

This system of government allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while also ensuring that the central government has a degree of control over national policies and decisions.</p>
