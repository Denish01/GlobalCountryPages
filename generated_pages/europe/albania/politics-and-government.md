Albania's government is based on the principles of **democracy**, **separation of powers**, and **protection of human rights**. The **constitution**, adopted in 1998, serves as the foundation of the country's laws and institutions.

The legislative branch, known as the **Kuvendi**, is a unicameral parliament composed of 140 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The judicial branch is composed of the **Supreme Court** and lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly and impartially.

The **separation of powers** is a key feature of Albania's political system, with each branch serving as a check on the others to prevent any one branch from abusing its power. This system is designed to promote **stability**, **accountability**, and **transparency** in government. Albania's **unitary** system of government means that the central government has authority over the entire country, with no regional or local governments having significant autonomy.

Albania's **parliamentary system** means that the government is accountable to the legislature, with the Prime Minister and ministers responsible for answering questions and providing information to members of parliament. This system is designed to promote **accountability** and **transparency** in government, with the legislature serving as a check on the executive branch.
