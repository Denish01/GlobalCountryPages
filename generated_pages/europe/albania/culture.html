        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Albania's culture is a unique blend of Mediterranean and Balkan influences, shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe. The country's cultural identity is defined by its <strong>Illyrian heritage</strong>, with the Albanian people being the direct descendants of the ancient Illyrians. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Albania is predominantly Albanian, with a small minority of Greeks, Macedonians, and Montenegrins. The official language, Albanian, is a <strong>unique Indo-European language</strong> that has been influenced by Turkish, Italian, and Greek. The country's cultural identity has also been shaped by its complex history, with periods of Ottoman, Italian, and communist rule leaving a lasting impact on its traditions, customs, and values.</p>
        <p>The Albanian people are known for their <strong>hospitality</strong> and warm welcoming nature, which is reflected in their traditional <strong>besa</strong> code of honor and respect. This code emphasizes the importance of family, friendship, and community, and is still an integral part of Albanian culture today. The country's cultural identity is also reflected in its rich folklore, with traditional music, dance, and handicrafts playing an important role in Albanian society.
