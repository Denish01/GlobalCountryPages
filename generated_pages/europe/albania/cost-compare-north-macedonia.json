In terms of cost of living, Albania has a slight edge over North Macedonia, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The economic context of both countries is similar, with a mix of agriculture, industry, and services driving their economies. However, Albania's economy has been growing at a faster pace in recent years, with a GDP growth rate of around 4% compared to North Macedonia's 3%. This has led to an increase in foreign investment and tourism, which has contributed to the country's lower cost of living.\n\nOverall, Albania is a more affordable destination for travelers and expats, with a cost of living that is around 10-20% lower than North Macedonia. This is due to a combination of factors, including lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary depending on the location, with cities like Tirana and Skopje tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Additionally, the cost of living in both countries can fluctuate over time, so it's always a good idea to research current prices and exchange rates before making any decisions.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Albania (USD) | North Macedonia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $250 | $350 | 29% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $200 | 25% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $550 | 27% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Albania (USD) | North Macedonia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $7 | 29% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $200 | $250 | 20% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1.50 | $2 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Albania (USD) | North Macedonia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $25 | 20% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $0.75 | 33% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.20 | $1.30 | 8% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Albania (USD) | North Macedonia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $80 | $100 | 20% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $25 | 20% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Albania (USD) | North Macedonia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $500 | $650 | 23% |\n| Mid-Range | $800 | $1,000 | 20% |\n| Comfortable | $1,200 | $1,500 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Albania is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and accommodation, with prices around 25-30% lower than North Macedonia\n- Food and dining, with meal prices around 20-30% lower\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices around 20-30% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices around 20-30% lower\n- **North Macedonia is cheaper for:**\n- Some tourist attractions and activities, such as hiking and skiing\n- Certain types of groceries, such as meat and dairy products\n- Some types of accommodation, such as hostels and guesthouses\n- Certain types of transportation, such as buses and trains\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Albania offers a more affordable cost of living, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.
