[SECTION] Overview: Albania vs Montenegro [/SECTION]
Albania and Montenegro are two neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe, both offering a unique blend of Mediterranean and Balkan cultures. In terms of cost of living, Albania is generally the more affordable option, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. This makes it an attractive destination for expats, students, and retirees looking to stretch their budget. Montenegro, on the other hand, has a more developed tourism industry and a higher standard of living, which is reflected in its higher prices.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Albania has a growing economy, with a focus on agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, while Montenegro has a more service-based economy, with a strong focus on tourism.
