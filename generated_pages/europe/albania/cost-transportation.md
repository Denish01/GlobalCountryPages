[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Albania has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on private vehicles or taxis to get around. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Tirana having a more comprehensive network of buses and minibuses. However, the lack of a metro or subway system in any of the major cities means that traffic congestion is a significant problem, particularly during rush hour. Despite these challenges, Albania's scenic countryside and historic towns make it a great destination for those who enjoy driving or taking taxis.

The main transportation modes in Albania are buses, minibuses, and taxis, with many people also relying on ride-hailing apps such as Bolt and Taxi Tirana. The country's rugged terrain and limited infrastructure mean that traveling by car or taxi can be slow and expensive, but the scenic views and historic landmarks make it a worthwhile experience. For those on a budget, taking the bus or minibus is a more affordable option, with single fares starting from $0.50 USD.
