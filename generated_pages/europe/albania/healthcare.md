[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Albania's healthcare system is primarily funded by the government, with a mix of public and private providers. The public healthcare system provides basic medical care to all citizens, but the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. Urban areas, such as Tirana, tend to have better-equipped hospitals and more specialized care, while rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services. The private sector has grown significantly in recent years, offering higher-quality care and more specialized services, but at a higher cost.

The quality of care in Albania's healthcare system is generally considered to be good, with many well-trained medical professionals and modern medical equipment. However, there are still some challenges, such as limited resources, outdated facilities, and a shortage of specialized doctors in certain areas. The government has been working to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve access and quality of care.

Despite these efforts, there are still significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas. Many rural areas lack basic medical facilities, and patients often have to travel long distances to receive medical care. Additionally, the healthcare system can be bureaucratic and slow, with long waiting times for appointments and procedures.
