The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Tirana having a more comprehensive network of buses and minibuses. However, the lack of a metro or subway system in any of the major cities means that traffic congestion is a significant problem, particularly during rush hour. Despite these challenges, Albania's scenic countryside and historic towns make it a great destination for those who enjoy driving or taking taxis.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Albania are buses, minibuses, and taxis, with many people also relying on ride-hailing apps such as Bolt and Taxi Tirana. The country's rugged terrain and limited infrastructure mean that traveling by car or taxi can be slow and expensive, but the scenic views and historic landmarks make it a worthwhile experience. For those on a budget, taking the bus or minibus is a more affordable option, with single fares starting from $0.50 USD.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $15 | Good coverage in Tirana, limited in other cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in any city |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00 | N/A | Frequent routes in Tirana and other major cities |\n| Commuter Train | $2.00-$5.00 | $20 | Limited routes, mostly connecting Tirana to nearby towns |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5.00-$10.00 | Be sure to use a licensed taxi |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.00 | $0.30 | $3.00-$6.00 | Bolt and Taxi Tirana are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20.00-$30.00 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40.00-$60.00 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2.00-$5.00 | Limited toll roads, mostly connecting major cities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$20.00 | Frequent routes connecting major cities |\n| Domestic Flight | $50.00-$100.00 | Limited routes, mostly connecting Tirana to other major cities |\n| Train (long-distance) | $10.00-$20.00 | Limited routes, mostly connecting Tirana to nearby towns |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or using ride-hailing apps.\n- Always use licensed taxis and make sure the meter is turned on to avoid overcharging.\n- Be sure to negotiate the fare before starting your journey, especially when taking a taxi or minibus.\n- Consider renting a car for long-distance travel, as it can be more cost-effective than taking taxis or buses.\n- Use apps like Bolt and Taxi Tirana to book ride-hailing services and avoid language barriers.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow traffic rules to ensure a safe journey.",
