  "content": "Albania's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining public and private providers, with varying levels of quality and access throughout the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 127\nHospital Standard: Adequate\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nAlbania's healthcare system is primarily funded by the government, with a mix of public and private providers. The public healthcare system provides basic medical care to all citizens, but the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. Urban areas, such as Tirana, tend to have better-equipped hospitals and more specialized care, while rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services. The private sector has grown significantly in recent years, offering higher-quality care and more specialized services, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe quality of care in Albania's healthcare system is generally considered to be good, with many well-trained medical professionals and modern medical equipment. However, there are still some challenges, such as limited resources, outdated facilities, and a shortage of specialized doctors in certain areas. The government has been working to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to improve access and quality of care.\n\nDespite these efforts, there are still significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas. Many rural areas lack basic medical facilities, and patients often have to travel long distances to receive medical care. Additionally, the healthcare system can be bureaucratic and slow, with long waiting times for appointments and procedures.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mother Teresa University Hospital | Tirana | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| American Hospital | Tirana | Private | Cardiology, oncology, neurology | Yes |\n| Medicus Hospital | Tirana | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Regional Hospital | Vlorë | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Limited |\n| Hospital of Shkodër | Shkodër | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Hygeia Hospital | Tirana | Private | Cardiology, oncology, urology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Private health insurance is recommended for all visitors and expats, as it provides access to better-quality care and more specialized services.\n- Local insurance options are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- Expats and foreigners can purchase private health insurance plans from international companies, which often have partnerships with local hospitals and clinics.\n- The cost of health insurance in Albania can vary significantly, depending on the type of plan and provider.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n- It is essential to research and compare different insurance options to find the best plan for your needs and budget.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Pharmacies are widespread and easily accessible in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Many medications are available over-the-counter, but some may require a prescription from a doctor.\n- Common brands of medications are often available, but may be more expensive than generic alternatives.\n- Prescription medications can be filled at most pharmacies, but may require a doctor's prescription and identification.\n- The cost of medications in Albania can vary significantly, depending on the type and brand.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- All travelers to Albania should be up-to-date on routine vaccinations, such as MMR and DTaP.\n- Hepatitis A and typhoid vaccinations are recommended for all travelers, especially those who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- Rabies vaccinations are recommended for travelers who will be spending time outdoors or around animals.\n- Albania is considered to be a low-risk country for malaria, but travelers should still take precautions against mosquito bites.\n- The water supply in Albania is generally safe, but travelers should still take precautions to avoid waterborne illnesses.\n- Food safety is generally good in Albania, but travelers should still take precautions to avoid foodborne illnesses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Albania is not a major destination for medical tourism, but some private hospitals and clinics do offer specialized services, such as cosmetic surgery and dental care.\n- The cost of medical procedures in Albania can be significantly lower than in other European countries, making it an attractive option for some patients.\n- Some private hospitals and clinics have international accreditation and offer high-quality care, but patients should still do their research and carefully evaluate their options.\n- Popular procedures for medical tourism in Albania include cosmetic surgery, dental care, and orthopedic surgery.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an emergency, call the emergency number 127 or go to the nearest hospital.\n- Ambulance services are available, but may not always be reliable, especially in rural areas.\n- The nearest hospital may not always have the necessary equipment or specialized care, so patients may need to be transferred to a larger hospital.\n- It is essential to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of communication.\n- Insurance claims can be complex and time-consuming, so it is essential to have a good understanding of your insurance plan and its requirements.",
