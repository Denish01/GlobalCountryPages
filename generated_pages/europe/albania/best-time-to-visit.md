[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Albania has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm and dry summers, and mild and wet winters. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal lowlands, the mountainous regions, and the eastern plateaus. The coastal lowlands have a typical Mediterranean climate, with hot summers and mild winters, while the mountainous regions have a colder and more humid climate, with significant snowfall during the winter months. The eastern plateaus have a more continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers.

The dry season in Albania typically runs from May to October, with July and August being the driest months. The wet season, on the other hand, runs from November to April, with December and January being the wettest months. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Albania, with the peak tourist season coinciding with the dry season. During this time, the weather is warm and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, swimming, and visiting the country's many beaches and historical sites.

However, the peak season also means that popular destinations can get crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher. In contrast, the shoulder season, which includes the months of April, May, September, and October, offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices, making it an excellent time to visit Albania for those who prefer milder weather and smaller crowds.
