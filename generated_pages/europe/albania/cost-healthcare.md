[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Albania's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with public facilities generally offering lower-cost services, but often with longer wait times and varying quality. The public healthcare system is universal, covering all citizens, but the quality of care can be inconsistent, especially in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance, as public facilities may not always have English-speaking staff or the latest medical equipment. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality services, often with English-speaking staff, but at a significantly higher cost. Locals often rely on public facilities for routine care, while opting for private facilities for more complex or specialized treatments.

The Albanian healthcare system is generally well-organized, with a clear distinction between public and private providers. However, the system can be complex, and navigating it as a foreigner may require some effort. It is essential to have a basic understanding of the system, including the types of services available, the costs involved, and the requirements for insurance. While public facilities are generally more affordable, private facilities offer a more comprehensive range of services, often with shorter wait times and more modern equipment. As a result, many foreigners opt for private health insurance, which can provide access to a wider range of services and facilities.
