[SECTION] Overview: Albania vs Kosovo [/SECTION]
Albania and Kosovo are two neighboring countries in the Balkan region, sharing a common language and cultural heritage. However, they have distinct economic profiles, with Albania having a slightly higher GDP per capita and a more diversified economy. In terms of cost of living, Albania is generally cheaper than Kosovo, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The overall cost of living difference between the two countries is around 10-20%, making Albania a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Albania has a more developed tourism industry, which has driven up prices in certain areas, particularly in the capital city of Tirana. On the other hand, Kosovo's economy is still recovering from the aftermath of the Yugoslav wars, and the country is heavily reliant on remittances from abroad. As a result, prices in Kosovo tend to be higher due to the country's limited economic opportunities and high levels of unemployment.
