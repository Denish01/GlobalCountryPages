[SECTION] How Albania Is Divided [/SECTION]
Albania is divided into 12 counties, also known as **prefectures**, which are further divided into 61 municipalities. The counties are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and each has its own capital and local government. The municipalities, on the other hand, are responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This system of government allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while also ensuring that the central government has a degree of control over national policies and decisions.

The 12 counties of Albania vary significantly in terms of their geography, economy, and culture. Some counties, such as **Tirana** and **Durrës**, are heavily urbanized and have a strong focus on industry and commerce. Others, such as **Gjirokastër** and **Korçë**, are more rural and have a stronger focus on agriculture and tourism. This diversity is reflected in the different regions of Albania, each with its own unique character and attractions.
