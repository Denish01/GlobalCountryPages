# Cyprus Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Cyprus's culture is a unique blend of Greek and Turkish influences, shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The island's history, with various conquerors and rulers, has contributed to its distinct cultural identity. The majority of the population, approximately 78%, is ethnically Greek, while around 18% is ethnically Turkish. The official languages are Greek and Turkish, with English widely spoken, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. This multicultural heritage is reflected in the island's architecture, cuisine, and traditions.

The cultural landscape of Cyprus is also characterized by its strong sense of community and family ties. Traditional village life, with its narrow streets and picturesque courtyards, continues to play an important role in Cypriot society. The island's rich history, with numerous archaeological sites and ancient ruins, is a source of pride for its people. The mix of Byzantine, Ottoman, and British colonial influences has created a fascinating cultural tapestry, with many Cypriots embracing their complex heritage.

Cyprus's cultural identity is further defined by its strong Orthodox Christian tradition, with many festivals and celebrations centered around the church calendar. The island is also home to a significant number of Muslims, primarily in the northern part of the island, which is administered by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This diversity has contributed to a vibrant cultural scene, with a wide range of festivals, events, and traditions that reflect the island's unique character.
