The island is divided into two main climate zones: the coastal areas and the mountains. The coastal areas have a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 12°C in winter to 32°C in summer. The mountains, on the other hand, have a cooler climate, with average temperatures ranging from 6°C in winter to 25°C in summer. The **dry season** in Cyprus typically runs from May to October, with very little rainfall during these months. The **wet season**, which runs from November to April, is characterized by mild temperatures and occasional rainfall. The seasons in Cyprus have a significant impact on travel, with the peak tourist season coinciding with the summer months when the weather is hot and dry.\n\nThe best time to visit Cyprus depends on your preferences and what you want to do. If you're looking for beach activities, the summer months are the best time to visit. However, if you're looking for outdoor activities such as hiking or cycling, the spring and autumn months are more suitable. The winter months are ideal for sightseeing and exploring the island's cultural heritage, as the weather is mild and there are fewer tourists. Overall, Cyprus is a year-round destination, with each season offering its own unique charm and attractions.\n\nThe climate and seasons in Cyprus also affect the types of activities and events that take place on the island. For example, the summer months are peak season for festivals and outdoor events, while the winter months are better suited for indoor activities such as museum visits and cultural performances.
