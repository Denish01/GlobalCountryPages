[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Cyprus has a well-developed transportation network, with most people relying on private vehicles or public transportation to get around. The quality of public transit is generally good, with an extensive network of buses connecting major cities and towns. The main transportation modes in Cyprus include buses, taxis, and private cars, with the majority of the population owning a vehicle. The country's relatively small size and lack of a comprehensive rail network mean that buses and taxis are often the most convenient options for shorter journeys.

In larger cities like Nicosia and Limassol, public transportation is more frequent and reliable, with buses running regularly throughout the day. However, in smaller towns and rural areas, public transportation may be less frequent, and private vehicles or taxis may be the only options available. Overall, Cyprus has a relatively well-developed transportation network, making it easy to get around the country, although prices may vary depending on the mode of transport and location.
