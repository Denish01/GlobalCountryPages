# Cyprus Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Cyprus before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Cyprus has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country is a member of the European Union and the Schengen Area, which simplifies travel for EU citizens. However, citizens of other countries may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain a visa on arrival. Currently, citizens of over 50 countries can enter Cyprus without a visa, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an electronic visa application.

The visa policy of Cyprus is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate travel and tourism. The country has a well-developed tourism industry, and many visitors come to Cyprus to enjoy its beautiful beaches, rich history, and vibrant culture. Citizens of countries that do not require a visa can stay in Cyprus for up to 90 days within a 180-day period, while those who need a visa can stay for a shorter period, depending on the type of visa and the purpose of their visit.

They must provide an invitation letter from a Cypriot company, proof of business activities, and other supporting documents. Business travelers can stay in Cyprus for up to 90 days within a 180-day period, but they may need to apply for a residence permit if they plan to stay longer.
