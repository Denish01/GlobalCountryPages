[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Cyprus is relatively stable, with a mix of short-term and long-term leases available. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a security deposit usually equal to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with the landlord required to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, Cyprus's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Greece but higher than in Turkey. The country's housing market is also influenced by its **tourism industry**, with many properties being used as short-term rentals, especially in coastal areas.

The Cypriot government has implemented various measures to regulate the housing market and protect tenants, including rent control laws and regulations on property development. However, the market can still be competitive, especially in popular areas such as Nicosia and Limassol. As a result, it's essential for renters to be aware of their rights and to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Additionally, the country's **economic stability** and **high standard of living** make it an attractive destination for expats and foreigners looking to relocate.
