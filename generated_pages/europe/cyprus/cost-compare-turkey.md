[SECTION] Overview: Cyprus vs Turkey [/SECTION]
Cyprus and Turkey are two neighboring countries with distinct economic profiles. Cyprus, a member of the European Union, has a high-income economy with a strong service sector, while Turkey has a mixed economy with a growing industrial base. The cost of living in Cyprus is generally higher than in Turkey, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more expensive. However, the difference in cost of living between the two countries can vary depending on the specific location, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Cyprus has a relatively stable economy with low inflation, while Turkey has experienced higher inflation rates in recent years. This has led to a decrease in the purchasing power of the Turkish lira, making it more challenging for expats and tourists to afford everyday expenses. Overall, Turkey is generally cheaper than Cyprus, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living. However, Cyprus offers a more stable and secure environment, which may be worth the extra cost for some individuals.
