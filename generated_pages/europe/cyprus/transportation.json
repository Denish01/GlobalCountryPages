  "content": "To get around in Cyprus, you can utilize a variety of transportation options, including buses, taxis, and car rentals, as the country has a well-developed road network, but limited domestic air and rail services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Larnaca International Airport (LCA), Paphos International Airport (PFO)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: Bolt, local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nCyprus is easily accessible by air, with two main international airports, Larnaca International Airport (LCA) and Paphos International Airport (PFO), offering direct flights to major European cities, including London, Athens, and Istanbul. You can also reach Cyprus by sea, with ferry services connecting the island to Greece and other nearby countries. Overland entry points are limited, but you can enter Cyprus by car or bus from the north, although this may involve certain restrictions and requirements due to the island's complex political situation.\n\nThe main airports in Cyprus are well-connected to European cities, with airlines such as Aegean Airlines, Cyprus Airways, and Ryanair operating direct flights. If you're traveling from outside Europe, you may need to transit through a major hub like London or Dubai. Additionally, you can reach Cyprus by car or bus from Turkey or Greece, but be sure to research the necessary documentation and procedures in advance.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic air travel in Cyprus is limited, with no scheduled flights between the main cities. However, you can take a short flight from Larnaca to Paphos or Ercan International Airport in the north, which is not recognized by the international community.

Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $100, depending on the route and airline.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nCyprus has no rail network, making it one of the few European countries without a railway system. As a result, you won't find any trains or high-speed rail options on the island. However, there are plans to develop a rail network in the future, which could potentially connect the main cities and improve public transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus companies like InterCity Buses and Osypa Buses operate in Cyprus, connecting the main cities and towns.
