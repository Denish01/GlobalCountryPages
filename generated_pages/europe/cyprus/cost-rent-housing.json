Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a security deposit usually equal to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with the landlord required to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, Cyprus's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Greece but higher than in Turkey. The country's housing market is also influenced by its **tourism industry**, with many properties being used as short-term rentals, especially in coastal areas.\n\nThe Cypriot government has implemented various measures to regulate the housing market and protect tenants, including rent control laws and regulations on property development. However, the market can still be competitive, especially in popular areas such as Nicosia and Limassol. As a result, it's essential for renters to be aware of their rights and to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Additionally, the country's **economic stability** and **high standard of living** make it an attractive destination for expats and foreigners looking to relocate.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$900 | $400-$700 | basic amenities, suitable for singles |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $600-$1,000 | fully furnished, ideal for couples |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $900-$1,400 | spacious, suitable for families |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,400-$2,000 | luxurious, ideal for large families or expats |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $4,000-$6,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $2,500-$4,000 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $1,500-$2,500 | scenic views, peaceful surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Strovolos**: a popular neighborhood in Nicosia, with rents ranging from $800-$1,200 USD per month, known for its modern amenities and family-friendly atmosphere\n- **Makarios Avenue**: a lively area in Nicosia, with rents ranging from $1,000-$1,500 USD per month, famous for its shopping and dining options\n- **Limassol Marina**: a luxurious neighborhood in Limassol, with rents ranging from $1,500-$2,500 USD per month, offering stunning sea views and modern amenities\n- **Latsi**: a scenic neighborhood in Paphos, with rents ranging from $600-$1,000 USD per month, known for its natural beauty and peaceful surroundings\n- **Kato Paphos**: a historic neighborhood in Paphos, with rents ranging from $800-$1,200 USD per month, famous for its ancient ruins and cultural attractions\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Cyprus [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and work with a reputable real estate agent to find the best deals\n- Always inspect the property before signing a lease agreement and take photos of any damage\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, especially for long-term rentals\n- Be aware of **scams** and never pay a deposit without a signed contract\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and internet are usually not included in the rent\n- Furnished apartments are common, but it's essential to clarify what is included in the rent and what is not\n- Consider renting outside of the city center for more affordable options and a more relaxed atmosphere",
