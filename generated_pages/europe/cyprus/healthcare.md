[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Cyprus is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers to deliver comprehensive medical care. The public healthcare system is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost medical services to citizens and permanent residents, while private healthcare facilities cater to those who can afford to pay out-of-pocket or have private health insurance. The quality of care in Cyprus is excellent, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics staffed by highly trained medical professionals. Urban areas, such as Nicosia and Limassol, have better access to medical facilities and specialized care, while rural areas may have more limited options. However, the government has made efforts to improve healthcare services in rural areas, and many private hospitals and clinics have established facilities in these regions.

The public healthcare system in Cyprus is generally considered to be of high quality, with modern equipment and well-trained staff. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and some medical specialties may not be available in all public hospitals. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer a wider range of medical services, including specialized care and advanced diagnostic equipment, but can be more expensive. Many private hospitals and clinics in Cyprus have international accreditation and are popular with medical tourists.

Overall, Cyprus's healthcare system is well-structured and provides high-quality medical care to its residents and visitors. With a mix of public and private facilities, individuals can choose the type of care that best suits their needs and budget. The country's strategic location and well-developed healthcare system make it an attractive destination for medical tourism, with many patients traveling to Cyprus for specialized care and procedures.
