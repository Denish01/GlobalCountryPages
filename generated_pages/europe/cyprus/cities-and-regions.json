The districts are Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca, Paphos, Famagusta, and Kyrenia. However, the island is also divided along ethnic lines, with the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus controlling the southern two-thirds of the island, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus controlling the northern third. This division has been in place since 1974, when a military coup and subsequent Turkish intervention led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe division between the two areas is marked by the United Nations-controlled Green Line, which runs through the center of Nicosia, the capital city. The Green Line is a buffer zone that separates the two communities, and it is patrolled by United Nations peacekeeping forces. Despite the division, there are several crossing points along the Green Line, which allow people to move between the two areas.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Nicosia** (200,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Nicosia is a city with a rich history, dating back to the 7th century BC.
