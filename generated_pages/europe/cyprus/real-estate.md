[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Cyprus has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including government incentives, a growing economy, and a surge in foreign investment. The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Urban areas such as Limassol and Nicosia tend to be more expensive than rural areas, but offer a wider range of amenities and services. The current market trend is towards an increase in demand for properties in coastal areas, particularly in the western part of the island.

The price trajectory of the Cypriot property market has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with a notable spike in 2020. This growth is expected to continue, driven by the island's growing economy and its popularity as a tourist destination. However, the market is not without its challenges, and buyers should be aware of the potential risks and complexities involved in purchasing property in Cyprus.

In terms of urban vs rural areas, the property market in Cyprus is characterized by a significant divide between the two. Urban areas tend to be more expensive and offer a wider range of amenities and services, while rural areas are generally cheaper and offer a more traditional way of life. However, rural areas are also often characterized by a lack of infrastructure and services, which can make them less attractive to some buyers.
