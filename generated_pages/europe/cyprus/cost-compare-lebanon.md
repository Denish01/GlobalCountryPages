[SECTION] Overview: Cyprus vs Lebanon [/SECTION]
Cyprus and Lebanon are two distinct countries with different economic contexts, which significantly impact their cost of living. Cyprus, a European country with a high standard of living, has a strong economy driven by services, tourism, and finance. In contrast, Lebanon, a Middle Eastern country, has faced economic challenges in recent years, including a large public debt and a decline in its currency. As a result, Cyprus tends to be more expensive than Lebanon, particularly when it comes to housing, food, and transportation. However, Lebanon offers a more affordable lifestyle, especially for those who are willing to adapt to local customs and living conditions.

The cost of living difference between Cyprus and Lebanon is substantial, with Cyprus being around 20-30% more expensive. This disparity is mainly due to the higher cost of living in Cyprus, particularly in cities like Nicosia and Limassol, where the demand for housing and services is high. In contrast, Lebanon's cost of living is relatively lower, especially outside of Beirut, where the cost of housing and food is more affordable. Overall, while both countries have their unique advantages and disadvantages, Lebanon is generally the more affordable option for those looking to live in the region.
