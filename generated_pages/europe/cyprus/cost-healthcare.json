  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Cyprus can vary significantly depending on whether you are using the public or private system, with overall health expenditure per capita standing at $2,899.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,899\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 17.9%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Cyprus is a mixed model, comprising both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with modern facilities and well-trained medical professionals. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and the system can be bureaucratic. For locals, the public system is generally the first point of contact, with most people having access to a **General Practitioner (GP)** who can refer them to specialist care if needed. For foreigners, the situation is more complex, with some being eligible for public healthcare and others needing to rely on private providers. Having **health insurance** is highly recommended, especially for those who are not eligible for the public system.\n\nIn terms of quality, the private healthcare system in Cyprus is generally considered to be of high quality, with modern facilities and well-trained medical professionals. Many private hospitals and clinics have international accreditation, and some even offer **English-language services**. However, the cost of private healthcare can be high, and not all services are covered by insurance. For foreigners, the private system can be a good option, especially for those who are not eligible for the public system or who want to avoid long waiting times. Many private hospitals and clinics also offer **package deals** for common procedures, which can be a cost-effective option for those who are self-paying.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: free for locals, private: variable by clinic |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Public: free for locals, private: variable by clinic |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: limited services, private: comprehensive |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public: limited services, private: comprehensive |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public: free for locals, private: variable by clinic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public: free for locals, private: variable by hospital |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$1,000 | Public: free for locals, private: variable by hospital |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Public: free for locals, private: variable by hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Public: free for locals, private: variable by hospital |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public: limited availability, private: comprehensive |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public: free for locals, private: variable by clinic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare, limited private services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare, including specialist care and hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Comprehensive private healthcare, including repatriation and emergency evacuation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medication** is widely available in Cyprus, with many pharmacies stocking a range of medications.\n- **Over-the-counter medication** is also widely available, with many pharmacies and supermarkets stocking a range of products.\n- The cost of **common medications** can vary, but on average, a month's supply of medication can cost between $10-$50.\n- **Prescription rules** are strict in Cyprus, with many medications requiring a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is good, with many pharmacies located throughout the country, including in urban and rural areas.\n- **Generic medication** is widely available, and can be a cost-effective option for those who are self-paying.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, the best course of action is to call the **emergency number 112**, which will connect you with the local ambulance service. The ambulance service is well-equipped and staffed by trained medical professionals, and can provide emergency care and transportation to hospital. For foreigners, the best hospitals for emergency care are generally the private hospitals, which have modern facilities and well-trained medical staff. Some of the best private hospitals in Cyprus include the **Nicosia General Hospital** and the **Limassol General Hospital**, both of which have emergency departments and offer a range of medical services.\n\nIn terms of **emergency care**, Cyprus has a well-developed system, with many hospitals and clinics offering emergency services. The **public healthcare system** also offers emergency care, including ambulance services and emergency departments. However, waiting times can be long, and the quality of care can vary.
