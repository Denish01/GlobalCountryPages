The quality of public transit is generally good, with an extensive network of buses connecting major cities and towns. The main transportation modes in Cyprus include buses, taxis, and private cars, with the majority of the population owning a vehicle. The country's relatively small size and lack of a comprehensive rail network mean that buses and taxis are often the most convenient options for shorter journeys.\n\nIn larger cities like Nicosia and Limassol, public transportation is more frequent and reliable, with buses running regularly throughout the day. However, in smaller towns and rural areas, public transportation may be less frequent, and private vehicles or taxis may be the only options available. Overall, Cyprus has a relatively well-developed transportation network, making it easy to get around the country, although prices may vary depending on the mode of transport and location.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1.50 | $43 | Good coverage in larger cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2.50 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $4 | $1.10 | $8-$12 | Available throughout the country |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.50 | $0.80 | $6-$10 | Bolt and Uber available in larger cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $50-$70 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.35 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.25 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in larger cities |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mainly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Depending on route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Limited domestic flights, mainly to and from Larnaca and Paphos airports |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for public buses or using ride-hailing apps for shorter journeys.\n- Download the **Bolt** or **Uber** app for convenient and affordable ride-hailing options.\n- Be aware of **traffic** congestion in larger cities, especially during rush hour, and plan your journey accordingly.\n- When using taxis, make sure to **agree on the fare** before starting your journey to avoid any disputes.\n- Consider **renting a car** for longer journeys or to explore rural areas, but be aware of **parking** limitations in larger cities.\n- Always **wear a seatbelt** and follow **road safety** guidelines to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.",
