[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Cyprus is a mixed model, comprising both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with modern facilities and well-trained medical professionals. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and the system can be bureaucratic. For locals, the public system is generally the first point of contact, with most people having access to a **General Practitioner (GP)** who can refer them to specialist care if needed. For foreigners, the situation is more complex, with some being eligible for public healthcare and others needing to rely on private providers. Having **health insurance** is highly recommended, especially for those who are not eligible for the public system.

In terms of quality, the private healthcare system in Cyprus is generally considered to be of high quality, with modern facilities and well-trained medical professionals. Many private hospitals and clinics have international accreditation, and some even offer **English-language services**. However, the cost of private healthcare can be high, and not all services are covered by insurance. For foreigners, the private system can be a good option, especially for those who are not eligible for the public system or who want to avoid long waiting times. Many private hospitals and clinics also offer **package deals** for common procedures, which can be a cost-effective option for those who are self-paying.
