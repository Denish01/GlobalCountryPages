        <h2>How Cyprus Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Cyprus is divided into six districts, each with its own administrative center. The districts are Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca, Paphos, Famagusta, and Kyrenia. However, the island is also divided along ethnic lines, with the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus controlling the southern two-thirds of the island, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus controlling the northern third. This division has been in place since 1974, when a military coup and subsequent Turkish intervention led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
        <p>The division between the two areas is marked by the United Nations-controlled Green Line, which runs through the center of Nicosia, the capital city. The Green Line is a buffer zone that separates the two communities, and it is patrolled by United Nations peacekeeping forces. Despite the division, there are several crossing points along the Green Line, which allow people to move between the two areas.</p>

        <li>The southern part of the island, controlled by the Republic of Cyprus, has a more diverse economy, with a strong emphasis on services, industry, and tourism.</li>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Cyprus has a well-developed transportation network, with several options for getting around the island. The country has two international airports, one in Larnaca and one in Paphos, which offer flights to destinations around the world. There are also several bus companies that operate on the island, offering routes between major cities and towns. In addition, there are several car rental companies, which offer a range of vehicles for hire. The road network in Cyprus is well-developed, with several major highways and roads that connect the major cities and towns.</p>
        <p>However, it's worth noting that the division between the two areas of the island can make it difficult to get around, especially for people who want to cross the Green Line. There are several crossing points along the Green Line, but they can be subject to delays and security checks. Additionally, some areas of the island, such as the Troodos Mountains, can be difficult to reach by public transportation, and may require a car or taxi. [CALLOUT] It's a good idea to plan ahead and research the best options for getting around the island, especially if you're planning to cross the Green Line.</p>
