The system is primarily funded through taxation, and all residents are entitled to comprehensive medical care, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescribed medications. The quality of care is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, the remote location of the islands can sometimes limit access to specialized care, particularly in rural areas. Despite this, the Faroese healthcare system is well-organized and efficient, with a strong focus on preventive care and public health initiatives.\n\nThe public healthcare system is the primary provider of medical services in the Faroe Islands, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. Private healthcare options are limited, but some private clinics and medical practices do exist, particularly in the capital city of Torshavn. Overall, the healthcare system in the Faroe Islands is well-suited to meet the medical needs of its population, with a strong emphasis on quality care and accessibility.\n\nThe Faroe Islands' healthcare system is also closely integrated with the Danish healthcare system, which provides access to specialized care and medical expertise that may not be available in the Faroe Islands. This partnership allows for the transfer of patients to Danish hospitals for specialized treatment, as well as the sharing of medical expertise and resources.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics
