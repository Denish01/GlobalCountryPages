[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in the Faroe Islands is relatively small and stable, with a limited supply of properties available for sale. The market is driven by local demand, with most buyers being residents of the islands. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in interest from foreign buyers, particularly from Denmark and other European countries. The price trajectory has been steadily increasing, with a growth rate of around 5% per annum. The urban areas, such as Torshavn and Klaksvik, tend to have higher property prices compared to rural areas. The rental market is also relatively small, but it is becoming increasingly popular, especially among young professionals and students.

The Faroe Islands' unique location and harsh climate can make it challenging to build and maintain properties, which can drive up construction costs. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to encourage sustainable development and improve the overall quality of life in the islands. The property market is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the fishing industry being a significant contributor to the economy. As a result, the market can be sensitive to changes in the global fishing industry and the overall economic climate.

In terms of trends, there is a growing interest in **sustainable** and **eco-friendly** properties, with many buyers looking for homes that are energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. This has led to an increase in the development of green buildings and the use of renewable energy sources. Additionally, the government has introduced various incentives to encourage the development of **affordable housing**, which has helped to increase the supply of properties available to first-time buyers and low-income households.
