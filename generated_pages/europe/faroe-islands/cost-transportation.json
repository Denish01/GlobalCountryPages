  "content": "The cost of transportation in Faroe Islands can vary depending on the mode of transport, with a monthly transit pass costing around $130 USD and taxi start rates at approximately $6 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($130 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($6 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($2.30 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (No — limited options)\nCurrency: DKK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nThe primary mode of transportation in Faroe Islands is by car, as the country has a limited public transportation system. The capital city, Torshavn, has a relatively well-developed bus network, but services can be infrequent and limited in rural areas. Many residents own cars due to the lack of alternative transportation options, and the country's rugged terrain and limited road network can make traveling by car a challenging but scenic experience. The Faroe Islands have a high standard of living, with a GDP per capita PPP of $81,909, which contributes to a relatively high cost of transportation.\n\nThe quality of public transit in Faroe Islands is decent, with buses connecting major towns and villages, but the frequency and coverage can be limited. Most people get around by car, and the country has a well-maintained road network, despite its limited size. However, the unique geography of the Faroe Islands, with its many islands and fjords, can make traveling by car a time-consuming and sometimes challenging experience. The government has invested in improving the road network and public transportation system, including the introduction of new bus services and the construction of subsea tunnels to connect the islands.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2.50 | $130 | Limited coverage, but frequent services in Torshavn |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $6 | $2.50 | $10-$20 | Limited availability, especially outside Torshavn |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited options, such as local taxi apps |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $50-$70 | To Torshavn city center, by taxi or private transfer |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $2.30 | High fuel taxes contribute to the cost |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $2.20 | Slightly cheaper than gasoline |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $80-$120 | Economy car, including insurance and taxes |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in Torshavn |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Subsea tunnels, paid by cash or card |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Limited services, mainly connecting major towns |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | From Vagar Airport to other islands, with Atlantic Airways |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available, due to the country's geography |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider renting a car to explore the islands, as public transportation can be limited.\n- Use the local bus network in Torshavn, which is relatively frequent and affordable.\n- Be prepared for variable weather conditions, including strong winds and rain, when driving.\n- Use cash or card to pay for toll roads and parking, as not all machines accept foreign cards.\n- Download local taxi apps or book in advance to ensure availability, especially outside Torshavn.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and drive carefully, as the country's roads can be narrow and winding.",
