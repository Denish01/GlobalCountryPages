The islands are divided into six regions, known as sýslur, which are further subdivided into 30 municipalities, or kommunur. Each municipality has its own elected council and is responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The six regions are: Norðoyggjar, Eysturoy, Streymoy, Vágar, Sandoy, and Suðuroy.\n\nThe administrative structure of the Faroe Islands is designed to provide a high level of autonomy to the local municipalities, while also ensuring that the central government in Torshavn can provide support and coordination as needed. This structure has allowed the Faroe Islands to maintain a strong sense of community and local identity, while also benefiting from the resources and expertise of the central government.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Torshavn** (13,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its vibrant harbor, historic fort, and lively music scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and nightlife\n**Klaksvík** (4,900)\nRole: economic hub, port city\nKnown For: its busy harbor, seafood processing industry, and stunning coastal scenery\nBest For: visitors interested in outdoor activities, such as hiking and fishing\n**Runavík** (3,700)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its picturesque harbor, historic church, and thriving arts scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and traditional Faroese cuisine\n**Tórshavn suburb of Hoyvík** (2,600)\nRole: residential area, cultural center\nKnown For: its scenic coastal views, historic landmarks, and lively community events\nBest For: visitors looking for a relaxed, suburban atmosphere\n**Sørvágur** (1,100)\nRole: port city, tourist hub\nKnown For: its stunning lake, picturesque village, and outdoor recreational opportunities\nBest For: visitors interested in nature, outdoor activities, and scenic views\n**Miðvágur** (1,100)\nRole: residential area, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic church, scenic coastal views, and thriving business community\nBest For: visitors looking for a mix of natural beauty and economic activity\n**Sandur** (500)\nRole: residential area, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic church, scenic coastal views, and traditional Faroese architecture\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and traditional village life\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Norðoyggjar | rugged, scenic | dramatic coastline, historic lighthouses | Klaksvík |\n| Eysturoy | picturesque, rural | rolling hills, traditional villages | Runavík |\n| Streymoy | urban, cultural | vibrant capital, historic landmarks | Torshavn |\n| Vágar | scenic, outdoor | stunning lake, picturesque villages | Sørvágur |\n| Sandoy | rural, historic | traditional villages, scenic coastline | Sandur |\n| Suðuroy | rugged, natural | dramatic coastline, outdoor recreational opportunities | Tvøroyri |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The northern regions of Norðoyggjar and Eysturoy are known for their rugged, scenic landscapes and traditional villages, with a strong focus on fishing and agriculture.\n- The southern regions of Streymoy and Vágar are more urbanized, with a greater emphasis on tourism, culture, and services.\n- The western region of Suðuroy is characterized by its dramatic coastline, outdoor recreational opportunities, and strong sense of community.\n- The eastern region of Sandoy is known for its traditional villages, scenic coastline, and historic landmarks, with a strong focus on preserving local culture and heritage.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nThe Faroe Islands have a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, buses, and ferries connecting the main islands and regions.
