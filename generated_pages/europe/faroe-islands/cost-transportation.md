[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The primary mode of transportation in Faroe Islands is by car, as the country has a limited public transportation system. The capital city, Torshavn, has a relatively well-developed bus network, but services can be infrequent and limited in rural areas. Many residents own cars due to the lack of alternative transportation options, and the country's rugged terrain and limited road network can make traveling by car a challenging but scenic experience. The Faroe Islands have a high standard of living, with a GDP per capita PPP of $81,909, which contributes to a relatively high cost of transportation.

The quality of public transit in Faroe Islands is decent, with buses connecting major towns and villages, but the frequency and coverage can be limited. Most people get around by car, and the country has a well-maintained road network, despite its limited size. However, the unique geography of the Faroe Islands, with its many islands and fjords, can make traveling by car a time-consuming and sometimes challenging experience. The government has invested in improving the road network and public transportation system, including the introduction of new bus services and the construction of subsea tunnels to connect the islands.
