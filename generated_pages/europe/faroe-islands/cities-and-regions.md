[SECTION] How Faroe Islands Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Faroe Islands are a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, with a high degree of autonomy in most domestic matters. The islands are divided into 30 municipalities, each with its own elected council, and 6 sýslur (regions), which are used for administrative and statistical purposes. This decentralization allows for local decision-making and a strong sense of community, with each municipality responsible for providing services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure to its residents.

The Faroe Islands' unique geography, with its rugged landscape and scattered population, has led to the development of a distinct administrative structure. The 6 sýslur (regions) are used to group municipalities together for regional planning and cooperation, and are an important part of the islands' system of governance. The regions are also used for statistical purposes, such as collecting data on population, economy, and education.
