[SECTION] How Faroe Islands Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Faroe Islands are a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, and as such, they have their own unique administrative structure. The islands are divided into six regions, known as sýslur, which are further subdivided into 30 municipalities, or kommunur. Each municipality has its own elected council and is responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The six regions are: Norðoyggjar, Eysturoy, Streymoy, Vágar, Sandoy, and Suðuroy.

The administrative structure of the Faroe Islands is designed to provide a high level of autonomy to the local municipalities, while also ensuring that the central government in Torshavn can provide support and coordination as needed. This structure has allowed the Faroe Islands to maintain a strong sense of community and local identity, while also benefiting from the resources and expertise of the central government.
