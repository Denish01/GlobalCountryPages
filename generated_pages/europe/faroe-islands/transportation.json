  "content": "To get around in the Faroe Islands, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, and rental cars, as the territory has a limited but well-connected transportation network. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Vagar Airport, FAE\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe Faroe Islands are located about halfway between Iceland and Norway, and the main entry point is Vagar Airport, which receives flights from major European hubs like Copenhagen and Reykjavik. Direct flights to the Faroe Islands are limited, but you can connect through these cities to reach the territory. The airport is located on the island of Vagar, about 45 kilometers west of the capital city Torshavn. From the airport, you can take a bus or taxi to reach your destination. \n\nOverland entry points do not exist in the Faroe Islands, as it is an island territory surrounded by the North Atlantic Ocean. The only way to reach the islands is by air or sea, with regular ferry services connecting the Faroe Islands to Denmark and Iceland. However, these ferry services are more suited for cargo and locals, and tourists usually prefer to fly to the territory. \n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in the Faroe Islands is limited, with only a few routes connecting the main islands. The national carrier, **Atlantic Airways**, operates flights between Vagar Airport and the smaller islands of Mykines, Suduroy, and Skuvoy. These flights are usually small propeller planes and can be affected by the weather. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during the peak tourist season. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $100 USD per person, depending on the route and time of booking. \n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThe Faroe Islands do not have a rail network, making it one of the few countries in Europe without a railway system. The rugged terrain and limited population have made it unnecessary to develop a rail network, and buses and ferries are the primary modes of public transportation. \n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThe bus network in the Faroe Islands is relatively well-developed, with **Strandfaraskip Landsins** being the main bus company. They operate routes connecting the capital city Torshavn to other towns and villages on the main islands. The buses are modern and comfortable, and the routes cover most of the territory.
