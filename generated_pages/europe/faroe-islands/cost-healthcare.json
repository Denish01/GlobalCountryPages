The system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. For locals, the system is largely free, with most services covered by the national health insurance scheme. However, for foreigners, the situation is different, and they may need to pay out-of-pocket for medical services or have private insurance to cover their costs. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be better than the private system, which is limited and mostly used by those who want additional services or faster access to care.\n\nThe healthcare system in the Faroe Islands is managed by the Ministry of Health, which oversees the provision of medical services, including hospital care, primary care, and specialized care. The system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions, with most services covered by the national health insurance scheme. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private insurance to cover their medical costs, as the public system may not cover all services. Additionally, some medical services, such as dental care and eye exams, may not be fully covered by the public system, and patients may need to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance to cover these costs.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $30-$50 | $100-$150 | Public system is generally cheaper, but may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $200-$300 | Private system may offer faster access to specialists, but at a higher cost |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public system covers basic dental care, but may not cover cosmetic procedures |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public system covers basic eye exams, but may not cover contact lenses or glasses |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public system covers basic blood tests, but may not cover more specialized tests |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public system covers emergency care, but may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | Public system covers hospital stays, but may have shared rooms and limited amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Private system may offer more specialized surgical services, but at a higher cost |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Public system covers childbirth, but may have limited options for pain management and other services |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Public system covers basic imaging services, but may have longer wait times |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public system covers basic imaging services, but may have limited availability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Covers more specialized medical services, including surgical procedures and diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Covers medical services for foreigners, including emergency care and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as pain relievers and antibiotics, are available at pharmacies and cost between $5-$20 USD per prescription.\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, and patients need to have a prescription from a licensed doctor to obtain medication.\n- Pharmacies are widely available, with several locations in Torshavn and other major towns.\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as cold and flu medications, are available at pharmacies and cost between $10-$30 USD per package.\n- Some medications, such as birth control and certain prescription medications, may be more expensive and cost between $50-$100 USD per prescription.\n- Pharmacy hours are generally limited, and patients may need to visit a hospital or emergency room for after-hours care.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, patients should call the emergency number, 112, which is available 24/7.
