[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Faroe Islands have a **parliamentary democracy** with a unicameral legislature, known as the Løgting, which has 33 seats. The Løgting is responsible for passing laws and approving the budget, while the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the territory. The **separation of powers** is ensured by the independence of the judiciary, which is based on Danish law with some local adaptations. The Faroe Islands have a high level of autonomy, with the ability to self-govern in most areas, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure. However, the Danish government is responsible for defense and foreign affairs.

The **federal vs unitary** distinction is not directly applicable to the Faroe Islands, as they are a territory within a kingdom. However, the relationship between the Faroe Islands and Denmark can be seen as a form of **asymmetrical federalism**, where the territory has a significant degree of autonomy while still being part of the larger kingdom. This arrangement allows the Faroe Islands to maintain their unique cultural and linguistic identity while still benefiting from the economic and security advantages of being part of Denmark.

The **political culture** of the Faroe Islands is characterized by a strong sense of community and a high level of civic engagement. The territory has a long tradition of democratic governance, with a strong emphasis on consensus-building and cooperation between different political parties. This has contributed to the stability and effectiveness of the government, allowing the Faroe Islands to maintain a high level of social and economic development despite their remote location.
