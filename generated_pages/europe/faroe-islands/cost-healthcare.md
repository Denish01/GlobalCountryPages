[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The Faroe Islands have a public healthcare system that provides high-quality medical care to all citizens, with a strong focus on preventive care and community health. The system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. For locals, the system is largely free, with most services covered by the national health insurance scheme. However, for foreigners, the situation is different, and they may need to pay out-of-pocket for medical services or have private insurance to cover their costs. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be better than the private system, which is limited and mostly used by those who want additional services or faster access to care.

The healthcare system in the Faroe Islands is managed by the Ministry of Health, which oversees the provision of medical services, including hospital care, primary care, and specialized care. The system is funded through a combination of government funding and patient contributions, with most services covered by the national health insurance scheme. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private insurance to cover their medical costs, as the public system may not cover all services. Additionally, some medical services, such as dental care and eye exams, may not be fully covered by the public system, and patients may need to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance to cover these costs.
