The Faroe Islands have a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter visa-free for tourism and business purposes.

Citizens of over 90 countries, including those in the European Union, the United States, Canada, and Australia, can enter the Faroe Islands without a visa for stays of up to 90 days.

The Faroe Islands' visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to promote tourism and economic development. The islands' unique cultural and natural heritage make them an attractive destination for visitors from around the world, and the visa policy is intended to make it easy for tourists and business travelers to visit. However, citizens of certain countries may need to obtain a visa before arriving in the Faroe Islands, and all visitors must meet certain requirements, such as having a valid passport and proof of onward travel.
