[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nThe United Kingdom has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from certain countries eligible for visa-free access, while others may need to apply for a visa before their trip. The UK allows citizens from over 90 countries to enter without a visa, including the US, Canada, and Australia, for a specified period, usually up to six months. However, the type of visa required and the duration of stay vary depending on the nationality and the purpose of the visit.\n\nThe UK's visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate travel and trade. The country uses a points-based system to assess visa applications, taking into account factors such as the applicant's qualifications, work experience, and language skills. The UK also has a range of visa categories, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and restrictions.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 6 months | Must have a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | N/A | N/A | UK citizens do not need a visa to enter the UK |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 6 months | Must have a valid passport, some restrictions apply for non-EU family members |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 6 months | Must have a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 6 months | Must have a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 6 months | Must apply for a visa before traveling |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 6 months | Must apply for a visa before traveling |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists visiting the UK for up to six months do not need a visa, but they must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel.
