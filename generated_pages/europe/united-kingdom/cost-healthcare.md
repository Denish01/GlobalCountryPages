[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The United Kingdom has a universal healthcare system, primarily funded through general taxation and **National Insurance** contributions. The **NHS** provides comprehensive and generally free healthcare services to UK residents, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, there are some exceptions, such as dental care and optical services, which may incur additional costs. For foreigners, the situation is more complex, as access to NHS services depends on their residency status and the type of visa they hold. In general, tourists and short-term visitors may not be eligible for free NHS services and may need to pay for private healthcare or have **travel insurance** that covers medical expenses.

The quality of public and private healthcare in the UK is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be longer in the public system, which may prompt some individuals to opt for private healthcare. Additionally, private healthcare providers often offer more personalized services, such as single rooms and more flexible appointment scheduling. Whether you need insurance depends on your individual circumstances, but it is generally recommended for foreigners and those who want to access private healthcare services.
