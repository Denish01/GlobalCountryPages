The language of instruction in the UK is English, and compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 5 to 16. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities such as London, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and American high school diplomas.\n\nThe UK education system is divided into several stages, including primary education (ages 5-11), secondary education (ages 11-16), and further education (ages 16-18). Students can then choose to pursue higher education at a university or college. The UK is home to many world-class universities, including the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, which are consistently ranked among the top universities globally.
