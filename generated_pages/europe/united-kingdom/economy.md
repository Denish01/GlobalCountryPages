[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
The United Kingdom has a high-income economy, with a GDP per capita of over $39,000, and is considered one of the most developed economies in the world. The country has a long history of industrialization and has undergone significant economic transformations over the years, with a shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy. The UK is a member of the G7 and the G20, and is home to some of the world's most prominent financial institutions, including the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of England. The country's economy is also driven by a highly skilled workforce, with a strong emphasis on research and development, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

The UK's economy has experienced steady growth over the years, with a mix of domestic consumption, investment, and exports driving growth. However, the country's economy has also faced challenges, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, and rising inequality. The government has implemented various policies to address these challenges, including measures to boost economic growth, reduce inequality, and promote trade and investment. The UK's economy is also characterized by a high level of regional disparities, with London and the South East being the most economically developed regions, while other regions, such as the North East and Wales, face greater economic challenges.
