[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Northern Ireland has two main international airports, Belfast International Airport (BFS) and George Best Belfast City Airport (BHD), which receive flights from various European and UK destinations. Belfast International Airport is the larger of the two and offers more direct flights, including those from European cities and some transatlantic routes with connections. Direct flight hubs include London, Manchester, and other major UK cities, making it relatively easy to reach Northern Ireland from within the UK. For those traveling overland, the most common entry points are from the Republic of Ireland, with several border crossings along the 499-kilometer border.

In addition to air travel, Northern Ireland can also be reached by sea, with ferry services connecting the region to Scotland and England. The most popular ferry routes include those from Belfast to Cairnryan in Scotland and from Larne to Cairnryan and Troon in Scotland. These ferry services provide an alternative to flying and can be a more leisurely way to travel, especially for those with cars or who prefer to avoid air travel. Overland entry from the Republic of Ireland is also straightforward, with several major roads and highways connecting the two countries.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Northern Ireland's domestic air network is limited, with most flights connecting Belfast to other parts of the UK. The main domestic airlines operating in Northern Ireland include British Airways, EasyJet, and Aer Lingus, which offer flights from Belfast to various UK destinations, including London, Manchester, and Edinburgh. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be relatively high due to the limited number of flights. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $50 to $200 or more, depending on the route and time of booking.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Northern Ireland's rail network is moderate, with train services connecting major towns and cities, including Belfast, Derry, and Coleraine. The main rail operator is Translink, which offers regular services on several key routes, including the Belfast to Derry line and the Belfast to Bangor line. While there are no high-speed rail options, the trains are generally comfortable and reliable, with scenic routes that offer a pleasant way to see the countryside. Booking train tickets can be done online or at train stations, and it's often cheaper to book in advance, especially for longer journeys.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Northern Ireland has an extensive network of bus and coach services, which provide a convenient and affordable way to get around. The main bus operator is Translink, which offers services on a wide range of routes, including intercity buses and local town services. Bus fares are generally reasonable, with prices starting from around $2 for a single journey. The quality of the buses is good, with most services operating modern, comfortable vehicles.
