Belfast International Airport is the larger of the two and offers more direct flights, including those from European cities and some transatlantic routes with connections. Direct flight hubs include London, Manchester, and other major UK cities, making it relatively easy to reach Northern Ireland from within the UK. For those traveling overland, the most common entry points are from the Republic of Ireland, with several border crossings along the 499-kilometer border.\n\nIn addition to air travel, Northern Ireland can also be reached by sea, with ferry services connecting the region to Scotland and England. The most popular ferry routes include those from Belfast to Cairnryan in Scotland and from Larne to Cairnryan and Troon in Scotland. These ferry services provide an alternative to flying and can be a more leisurely way to travel, especially for those with cars or who prefer to avoid air travel. Overland entry from the Republic of Ireland is also straightforward, with several major roads and highways connecting the two countries.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nNorthern Ireland's domestic air network is limited, with most flights connecting Belfast to other parts of the UK. The main domestic airlines operating in Northern Ireland include British Airways, EasyJet, and Aer Lingus, which offer flights from Belfast to various UK destinations, including London, Manchester, and Edinburgh. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be relatively high due to the limited number of flights. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $50 to $200 or more, depending on the route and time of booking.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nNorthern Ireland's rail network is moderate, with train services connecting major towns and cities, including Belfast, Derry, and Coleraine. The main rail operator is Translink, which offers regular services on several key routes, including the Belfast to Derry line and the Belfast to Bangor line. While there are no high-speed rail options, the trains are generally comfortable and reliable, with scenic routes that offer a pleasant way to see the countryside. Booking train tickets can be done online or at train stations, and it's often cheaper to book in advance, especially for longer journeys.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nNorthern Ireland has an extensive network of bus and coach services, which provide a convenient and affordable way to get around. The main bus operator is Translink, which offers services on a wide range of routes, including intercity buses and local town services. Bus fares are generally reasonable, with prices starting from around $2 for a single journey. The quality of the buses is good, with most services operating modern, comfortable vehicles. Intercity bus companies, such as Aircoach and Eurolines, also operate in Northern Ireland, offering connections to other parts of the UK and Ireland.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | none | - |  |\n| City Bus | Belfast, Derry, other towns | $2-$5 | Frequent services, affordable fares |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $10-$20/km | Widely available, but can be expensive |\n| Ride-Hailing | Belfast, Derry | $5-$10 | Uber and local alternatives available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | none | - | Not available in Northern Ireland |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Northern Ireland, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country or an international driver's license, and you must be at least 17 years old to drive a car.\n- Road conditions in Northern Ireland are generally good, with well-maintained roads and scenic routes, but be aware of potential hazards such as potholes and narrow country lanes.\n- Fuel costs in Northern Ireland are relatively high, with prices similar to those in the UK, so it's a good idea to budget accordingly.\n- Car rental companies are widely available, including major international brands and local operators, and it's often cheaper to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n- When driving in Northern Ireland, be aware of the local speed limits, which are generally lower than those in other parts of the UK, and take care when driving on narrow country roads.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of potential scams, such as overpriced taxi fares or fake ticket vendors, and always use licensed taxis or reputable transportation providers.\n- Payment methods in Northern Ireland include cash, credit cards, and contactless payments, and it's a good idea to have a combination of these options available.\n- Download transportation apps, such as the Translink app, to help plan your journeys and track bus and train schedules.\n- Be mindful of safety when using public transportation, especially at night, and try to avoid traveling alone in isolated areas.\n- Consider purchasing a Visitor Pass, which can provide discounts and convenience when using public transportation in Northern Ireland.\n- Be aware of any travel disruptions or road closures, especially during peak travel seasons or in areas with ongoing construction or maintenance work.\n- Respect local road rules and customs, such as driving on the left-hand side of the road and using designated parking areas.",
