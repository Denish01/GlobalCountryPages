[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Wales has a **temperate maritime climate**, with mild winters and cool summers. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal areas, which are generally milder and wetter; the mountains, which are cooler and more prone to rain; and the valleys, which are drier and sunnier. The **dry season** in Wales typically runs from April to September, with the warmest months being July and August. The **wet season**, from October to March, is characterized by higher rainfall and stronger winds. Understanding these seasons is crucial for planning your trip, as they can significantly affect travel and outdoor activities.

The seasons in Wales also impact the types of activities you can do and the crowds you can expect. During the peak summer months, popular tourist spots can get crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher. In contrast, the shoulder season, which includes the spring and autumn months, offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices, making it an ideal time for those who prefer to avoid the crowds.

Wales's unique geography and climate also mean that the weather can be quite unpredictable, even during the dry season. It's not uncommon to experience sudden rain showers or temperature drops, so it's essential to be prepared and pack accordingly.
