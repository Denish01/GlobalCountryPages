[/SECTION]\nWales is a region in the United Kingdom, and its cost of living is generally in line with the UK average. However, prices can vary depending on the location, with cities like Cardiff and Swansea tend to be more expensive than rural areas. Compared to other European countries, Wales is considered to be moderately priced, with lower costs than countries like Norway and Switzerland, but higher costs than countries like Poland and Hungary. Overall, Wales offers a great balance of quality of life and affordability, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike.\n\nThe cost of living in Wales is also influenced by its proximity to England, with many Welsh cities and towns being commuter hubs for English cities like Bristol and Liverpool. This has led to an increase in housing prices and costs of living in some areas, particularly in the south of Wales. However, the Welsh government has implemented various initiatives to promote affordability and support local businesses, which has helped to keep costs in check.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $20-40 | basic dorms and shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $80-150 | 3-star hotels with private bathrooms |\n| Luxury/Resort | $200-350 | 5-star hotels with amenities like spas and gyms |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $600-1,200 | city center vs outside, with utilities and internet |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $8-15 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-70 |\n| Fine Dining | $80-150 |\n| Beer (local) | $4-6 |\n| Coffee | $2-4 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $2-4 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $50-100 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 600 | 1,000 | 1,500 |\n| Food | 300 | 500 | 800 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 150 | 200 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 300 | 500 |\n| **Total** | **1,300** | **2,250** | **3,300** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting during the off-season (October to May) to take advantage of lower accommodation prices and fewer tourists.\n- Look for affordable accommodation options like hostels, guesthouses, and Airbnb apartments.\n- Take advantage of Wales' beautiful outdoors by hiking, cycling, or walking instead of relying on public transport.\n- Eat at local pubs and cafes, which often serve traditional Welsh cuisine at affordable prices.\n- Shop at local markets and supermarkets for fresh produce and groceries instead of relying on convenience stores.\n- Use public transport or walk/bike whenever possible to save on fuel and taxi costs.",
