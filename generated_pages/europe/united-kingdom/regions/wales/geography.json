The country is bordered by England to the east, with the English counties of Cheshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire forming the border. To the west, Wales is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, while the Irish Sea lies to the northwest. The country's unique geography has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The border with England is approximately 160 km long, and the two countries are connected by several major roads and railways.\n\nThe location of Wales has also influenced its climate, with the prevailing westerly winds bringing mild and wet air from the Atlantic Ocean. The country's coastline is approximately 1,200 km long, with a varied landscape of cliffs, beaches, and estuaries. The coastline has played a significant role in Wales' history, with many of its major towns and cities, such as Cardiff and Swansea, developing as ports and trading centers. The country's strategic location has also made it an important center for trade and commerce, with the ports of Milford Haven and Holyhead serving as major gateways for international trade.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nWales is a country of diverse landscapes, with a mix of mountains, valleys, and coastal plains. The **Snowdonia National Park** in northwest Wales is home to the highest mountain in England and Wales, Snowdon, which rises to an elevation of 1,085 meters. The park is also home to a range of other mountains, including the Glyderau and the Carneddau, which offer some of the most spectacular scenery in the country. The mountains of Snowdonia are made up of some of the oldest rocks in the world, with the **Precambrian** rocks dating back over 2.5 billion years.\n\nIn addition to its mountains, Wales is also home to a range of beautiful valleys and coastal plains. The **Valley of the River Wye**, which forms part of the border with England, is a picturesque region of rolling hills and scenic villages. The **Gower Peninsula**, which lies to the southwest of Swansea, is a designated **Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty**, with a mix of sandy beaches, rocky cliffs, and scenic coastal paths. The peninsula is also home to a range of unique wildlife, including seabirds, dolphins, and seals. The **Brecon Beacons National Park**, which lies in south-central Wales, is another area of outstanding natural beauty, with a mix of mountains, forests, and lakes.\n\nThe country's landscape has been shaped by a combination of geological and human factors, including the movement of glaciers during the last ice age and the activities of farmers and miners over the centuries. The **coal mining** industry, which was once a major employer in Wales, has left a lasting legacy on the landscape, with many former mining towns and villages now being regenerated for tourism and other purposes. The **iron and steel industry** has also played a significant role in shaping the landscape, with many of the country's major towns and cities developing around the industry.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 9-15°C | 80-100 mm | Mild and wet, with occasional sunshine |\n| Summer | June to August | 18-22°C | 60-80 mm | Warm and sunny, with occasional heatwaves |\n| Autumn | September to November | 10-15°C | 100-120 mm | Cool and wet, with occasional storms |\n| Winter | December to February | 2-6°C | 120-150 mm | Cold and wet, with occasional snow and frost |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: May to September.
