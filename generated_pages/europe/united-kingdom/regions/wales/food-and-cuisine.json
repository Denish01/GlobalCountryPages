The country's culinary identity has been shaped by its Celtic heritage, as well as its proximity to the sea and its agricultural landscapes. Welsh cuisine is characterized by its use of hearty, comforting ingredients such as lamb, beef, and root vegetables, often slow-cooked in stews or soups. The country's coastal regions are renowned for their fresh seafood, while its mountainous areas are home to a variety of game meats and foraged ingredients.\n\nRegional variations play a significant role in Welsh cuisine, with different areas of the country having their own unique specialties and ingredients. For example, the **Valleys** region is known for its traditional **Cockles and Laverbread**, while the **Gower Peninsula** is famous for its fresh seafood and **Welsh Cakes**. The country's capital, Cardiff, is a hub for foodies, with a wide range of restaurants and cafes serving both traditional and modern Welsh cuisine.\n\nWelsh cuisine has also been influenced by its historical ties to other European countries, particularly Ireland and Scotland. This is reflected in the country's love of **Bara Brith**, a sweet bread loaf made with dried fruit and tea, which is similar to the Irish **Barmbrack**. Despite these external influences, Welsh cuisine remains distinct and flavorful, with a strong emphasis on local ingredients and traditional cooking methods.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes
