[SECTION] How Wales Is Divided [/SECTION]
Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom, and its administrative structure is divided into 22 local authorities, which include 9 counties, 3 cities, and 10 county boroughs. These local authorities are responsible for providing various services such as education, social services, and transportation to the local population. The country is also divided into several preserved counties, which are used for ceremonial purposes and have a lord lieutenant who represents the British monarch.

The administrative structure of Wales is designed to provide effective governance and services to the local population, while also preserving the country's rich history and cultural heritage. The local authorities work together with the Welsh Government to implement policies and programs that promote economic development, improve public services, and protect the environment. The country's division into smaller local authorities also allows for more localized decision-making and community engagement, which is essential for addressing the unique needs and challenges of each area.
