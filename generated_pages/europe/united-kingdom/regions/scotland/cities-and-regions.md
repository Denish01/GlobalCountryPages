[SECTION] How Scotland Is Divided [/SECTION]
Scotland is divided into 32 council areas, which are responsible for providing local government services such as education, social care, and transportation. These council areas are further divided into smaller communities and towns, each with their own unique character and identity. The country is also divided into several regions, including the Highlands, the Lowlands, and the Islands, each with its own distinct culture and geography.

The administrative structure of Scotland is designed to provide a balance between local autonomy and national governance. The Scottish Government, which is based in Edinburgh, is responsible for making decisions on national policies and laws, while the council areas have a degree of autonomy to make decisions on local issues. This structure allows for a high degree of local participation and engagement, and helps to ensure that the needs and concerns of local communities are taken into account.
