[SECTION] What Is Scotland? [/SECTION]
Scotland is a country that occupies the northern third of the island of Great Britain, sharing a border with England to the south. It is a part of the United Kingdom, but has its own devolved government, which has the power to make decisions on certain domestic matters. Scotland is known for its rugged and diverse landscapes, which range from the rolling hills and picturesque lochs of the Lowlands to the towering mountains and rugged coastlines of the Highlands. The country has a rich cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on tradition, folklore, and history.
