[SECTION] How England Is Divided [/SECTION]
England is divided into nine regions, which are further subdivided into 48 ceremonial counties, and 55 unitary authorities, including 6 metropolitan counties. These regions have distinct economic, cultural, and geographical characteristics, and are used for administrative, statistical, and political purposes. The regional structure is not strictly hierarchical, and some regions have more autonomy than others, with some having directly elected mayors and assemblies.

The administrative divisions of England have evolved over time, with the current system being established in the 1990s. The regions are used to coordinate policies and programs at the national level, and to provide a framework for local government and economic development. Each region has its own unique identity, shaped by its history, geography, and culture, and they play an important role in shaping the country's overall character and direction.
