  "content": "In the United Kingdom, healthcare costs vary significantly depending on whether you are using the public **National Health Service (NHS)** or private healthcare services, with the average health expenditure per capita being $5,860.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $5,860\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 14.6%\nHealthcare System: Universal\nEmergency Number: 999 or 112\nInsurance Required: No\nCurrency: GBP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe United Kingdom has a universal healthcare system, primarily funded through general taxation and **National Insurance** contributions. The **NHS** provides comprehensive and generally free healthcare services to UK residents, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, there are some exceptions, such as dental care and optical services, which may incur additional costs. For foreigners, the situation is more complex, as access to NHS services depends on their residency status and the type of visa they hold. In general, tourists and short-term visitors may not be eligible for free NHS services and may need to pay for private healthcare or have **travel insurance** that covers medical expenses.\n\nThe quality of public and private healthcare in the UK is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be longer in the public system, which may prompt some individuals to opt for private healthcare. Additionally, private healthcare providers often offer more personalized services, such as single rooms and more flexible appointment scheduling. Whether you need insurance depends on your individual circumstances, but it is generally recommended for foreigners and those who want to access private healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $0-$20 | $50-$100 | Public services are generally free, but some services may incur a small fee |\n| Specialist Consultation | $0-$50 | $100-$250 | Referral from a GP is usually required for public services |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public dental services are means-tested, and some treatments may incur a fee |\n| Eye Exam | $0-$20 | $50-$100 | Public eye exams are free for children and certain adults, but some services may incur a fee |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $0-$20 | $50-$100 | Public services are generally free, but some tests may incur a fee |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $0-$100 | Public services are generally free, but some services may incur a fee |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $0-$500 | Public services are generally free, but some services may incur a fee |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Public services are generally free, but some services may incur a fee |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $0-$2,000 | Public services are generally free, but some services may incur a fee |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Public services are generally free, but some services may incur a fee |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Public services are generally free, but some services may incur a fee |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | GP visits, hospital stays, and some prescriptions |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | All medical services, including specialist consultations, surgeries, and hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Emergency medical evacuations, repatriation, and some non-emergency medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary, but a typical prescription fee is around $10-$20.\n- Over-the-counter medication prices are generally lower, with prices starting from $5-$10.\n- Pharmacy services are widely available, with many high-street pharmacies and online options.\n- Some medications, such as antibiotics, require a prescription from a GP or other authorized medical professional.\n- Pharmacy opening hours vary, but many are open from 9 am to 6 pm, Monday to Saturday.\n- Some pharmacies offer extended hours or 24-hour services, especially in larger cities.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial 999 or 112 to reach the emergency services.
