[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The United Kingdom has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from certain countries eligible for visa-free access, while others may need to apply for a visa before their trip. The UK allows citizens from over 90 countries to enter without a visa, including the US, Canada, and Australia, for a specified period, usually up to six months. However, the type of visa required and the duration of stay vary depending on the nationality and the purpose of the visit.

The UK's visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate travel and trade. The country uses a points-based system to assess visa applications, taking into account factors such as the applicant's qualifications, work experience, and language skills. The UK also has a range of visa categories, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and restrictions.
