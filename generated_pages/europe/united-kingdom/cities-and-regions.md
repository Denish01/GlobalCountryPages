[SECTION] How United Kingdom Is Divided [/SECTION]
The United Kingdom is a sovereign state that consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Each country has its own distinct culture, history, and government. England is the largest country, covering over half of the UK's land area, while Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are smaller but still unique in their own ways. The UK is also divided into regions, with England being split into 9 regions, each with its own regional government and administrative functions.

The administrative structure of the UK is complex, with power being divided between the central government in London and the regional governments in each country. The UK Parliament in London is responsible for making laws for the entire country, while the regional governments have powers to make decisions on matters such as education, healthcare, and transportation. This system allows for a balance of power and decision-making, ensuring that the needs of each region are taken into account.
