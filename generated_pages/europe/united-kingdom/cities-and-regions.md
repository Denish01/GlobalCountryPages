[SECTION] How United Kingdom Is Divided [/SECTION]
The United Kingdom is a sovereign state with a parliamentary system of government, comprising four constituent countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Each country has its own devolved administration, with varying degrees of autonomy, and is further divided into smaller administrative units, such as counties, districts, and unitary authorities. England, the largest country, is divided into nine regions, each with its own regional assembly, while Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own national assemblies.

The administrative structure of the United Kingdom is complex, with multiple layers of government, including local authorities, regional assemblies, and the national parliament in London. This system allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while also providing a framework for national policies and decision-making. The four countries of the United Kingdom also have distinct cultural, economic, and historical identities, which are reflected in their administrative structures and regional characteristics.
