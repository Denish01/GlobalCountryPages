The region was subsequently inhabited by various cultures, including the Romans, who invaded Britain in 43 AD and occupied it for nearly four centuries. The Anglo-Saxon period, which began in the 5th century AD, saw the establishment of various kingdoms, including Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex. The Norman Conquest of 1066 AD had a profound impact on the region, introducing feudalism and the French language, which would eventually influence the development of the English language.

The United Kingdom played a significant role in both World War I and World War II, suffering significant losses and damage.
