[SECTION] Overview: Estonia vs Russia [/SECTION]
Estonia and Russia are two neighboring countries with distinct economic profiles. Estonia, a member of the European Union, has a high-income economy with a strong service sector, while Russia, the world's largest country by land area, has a mixed economy with significant oil and gas reserves. The cost of living in Estonia is generally higher than in Russia, mainly due to its proximity to Western Europe and its adoption of the euro as its currency. However, Russia's larger size and more diverse economy mean that prices can vary significantly depending on the region.

The overall cost of living difference between Estonia and Russia is significant, with Estonia being around 20-30% more expensive. This is reflected in the prices of everyday items, such as food, housing, and transportation. However, both countries have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them ultimately depends on individual preferences and priorities. For example, Estonia offers a more modern and efficient infrastructure, while Russia provides a richer cultural experience and a more diverse natural environment.

However, it's worth noting that both countries have their own unique challenges and drawbacks, and the cost of living difference between them may not be the only factor to consider. Other factors, such as language, climate, and job opportunities, should also be taken into account when making a decision.
