Estonia is considered a very safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other European countries. The overall atmosphere is welcoming and friendly, making it an excellent destination for tourists. However, as with any foreign travel, it's essential to take normal precautions to ensure your safety. Petty crimes such as pickpocketing and bag snatching can occur in crowded areas and tourist hotspots, but these are relatively rare. Violent crimes are even less common, and Estonia has a strong reputation for being a secure and stable country.

The capital city, Tallinn, is particularly safe, with a strong police presence and well-lit streets. The city's old town is a popular tourist area, and visitors can feel comfortable walking around, even at night. However, it's always a good idea to be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas. The countryside and smaller towns are also generally safe, with low crime rates and a strong sense of community. Overall, Estonia is an excellent choice for travelers who want to experience a unique and safe cultural experience.
