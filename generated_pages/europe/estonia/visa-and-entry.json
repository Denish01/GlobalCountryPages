As a member of the Schengen Area, Estonia's visa policy is aligned with other European Union countries. Citizens of over 60 countries can enter Estonia without a visa for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. This includes citizens of the United States, Canada, Australia, and many European countries. However, citizens of other countries may need to apply for a visa before entering Estonia.\n\nEstonia's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade while maintaining national security. The country has a well-developed e-government system, which allows applicants to submit their visa applications online. Estonia also offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | Unlimited | Must have a valid passport or ID card |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply online or through embassy |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply online or through embassy |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Estonia visa-free for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.
