  "content": "In Estonia, healthcare costs are relatively high, with a health expenditure per capita of $2,438, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 21.4% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,438\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 21.4%\nHealthcare System: Universal\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nEstonia's **universal healthcare system** provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens, with both public and private healthcare options available. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be lengthy, and some specialized treatments may not be readily available. For foreigners, Estonia's healthcare system can be more complex, and having **health insurance** is often required for residence permits. Private healthcare options are also available, offering faster access to specialized care and more amenities, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe Estonian healthcare system is primarily funded through **social health insurance**, which is mandatory for all citizens and permanent residents. Employers and employees contribute to the system through payroll taxes, and the government also provides funding. This system ensures that everyone has access to necessary medical care, including **preventive care**, **diagnostic services**, and **treatments**. However, out-of-pocket expenses, such as copayments and deductibles, can still be significant, especially for prescription medications and specialized care. For foreigners, purchasing private health insurance can provide additional coverage and flexibility, including access to private healthcare providers and more comprehensive benefits.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics often have limited hours and availability |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may have shorter waiting times and more flexible scheduling |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public dental care is generally of high quality, but may have limited availability |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may offer more comprehensive eye exams and a wider selection of eyewear |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public labs may have longer waiting times for test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals have 24-hour emergency departments, while private hospitals may have more limited hours |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Private hospitals often offer more amenities and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Public hospitals may have longer waiting times for non-emergency procedures, while private hospitals can offer faster scheduling |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | Private hospitals may offer more amenities and personalized care, but at a higher cost |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public hospitals may have limited availability of MRI scans, while private hospitals can offer faster scheduling |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have X-ray facilities on site, while private hospitals may have more advanced imaging equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, including specialist consultations, hospital stays, and advanced diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Comprehensive coverage, including access to private healthcare providers, emergency medical evacuation, and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies, with prices varying depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, with prices comparable to those in other European countries.\n- Common medications, such as **pain relievers** and **antibiotics**, can cost between $5-$20.\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, requiring a doctor's prescription for most medications.\n- Pharmacies are widely available, with many locations open late or 24 hours.\n- Some medications may be subsidized by the government, reducing the out-of-pocket cost for patients.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the **emergency number 112**, which will connect you to a dispatch service that can send an ambulance or provide instructions for emergency care. Ambulances are well-equipped and staffed by trained paramedics, and can transport patients to the nearest hospital. For foreigners, it is recommended to have **private health insurance** that covers emergency medical evacuation and repatriation, in case you need to be transported to a hospital in another country. The best hospitals for foreigners in Estonia include the **Tallinn University Hospital** and the **East Tallinn Central Hospital**, which offer high-quality care and have staff who speak English and other languages.",
