[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Estonia is relatively stable, with a mix of old and new buildings available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the lease. Compared to its regional neighbors, Estonia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Finland but higher than in Latvia. The country's **housing market** is also influenced by its proximity to the Baltic Sea and the capital city of Tallinn, which is a popular destination for tourists and expats.

The Estonian government has implemented various initiatives to regulate the housing market and protect tenants, including rent control measures and subsidies for low-income households. However, the demand for housing, particularly in Tallinn, remains high, which can drive up prices and make it challenging for renters to find affordable options. Overall, Estonia's housing market offers a range of options for renters, from modern apartments in the city center to more affordable options in the suburbs and rural areas.
