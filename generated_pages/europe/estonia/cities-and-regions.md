[SECTION] How Estonia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Estonia is divided into 15 counties, each with its own administrative center and local government. These counties are further divided into municipalities, which can be either urban or rural. The country's administrative structure is relatively simple, with a focus on decentralization and local autonomy. The 15 counties are: Harju, Hiiu, Ida-Viru, Järva, Jõgeva, Lääne, Lääne-Viru, Pärnu, Põlva, Rapla, Saare, Tartu, Valga, Viljandi, and Võru.
