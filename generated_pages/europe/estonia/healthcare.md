[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Estonia's healthcare system is primarily funded through a mandatory health insurance scheme, which covers all citizens and permanent residents. The system is divided into two main parts: the public healthcare system, which provides a wide range of medical services, including doctor's visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions, and the private healthcare system, which offers additional services, such as specialized treatments and luxury hospital accommodations. The quality of care in Estonia is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. However, there can be some differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have more advanced medical facilities and a wider range of specialized services.

The public healthcare system in Estonia is managed by the Estonian Health Insurance Fund (EHIF), which is responsible for funding and organizing healthcare services. The EHIF provides a wide range of medical services, including doctor's visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions, and also covers the cost of certain medical procedures, such as surgery and diagnostic tests. In addition to the public healthcare system, there are also several private healthcare providers in Estonia, which offer a range of medical services, including specialized treatments and luxury hospital accommodations.

Estonia has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on preventive care and the use of modern technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of medical services. The country has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving the quality of care, such as the introduction of electronic health records and the development of specialized treatment centers for certain medical conditions.
