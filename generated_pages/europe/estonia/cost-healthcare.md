[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Estonia's **universal healthcare system** provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens, with both public and private healthcare options available. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be lengthy, and some specialized treatments may not be readily available. For foreigners, Estonia's healthcare system can be more complex, and having **health insurance** is often required for residence permits. Private healthcare options are also available, offering faster access to specialized care and more amenities, but at a higher cost.

The Estonian healthcare system is primarily funded through **social health insurance**, which is mandatory for all citizens and permanent residents. Employers and employees contribute to the system through payroll taxes, and the government also provides funding. This system ensures that everyone has access to necessary medical care, including **preventive care**, **diagnostic services**, and **treatments**. However, out-of-pocket expenses, such as copayments and deductibles, can still be significant, especially for prescription medications and specialized care. For foreigners, purchasing private health insurance can provide additional coverage and flexibility, including access to private healthcare providers and more comprehensive benefits.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the **emergency number 112**, which will connect you to a dispatch service that can send an ambulance or provide instructions for emergency care.

For foreigners, it is recommended to have **private health insurance** that covers emergency medical evacuation and repatriation, in case you need to be transported to a hospital in another country.
