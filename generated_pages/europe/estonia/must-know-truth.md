# The Truth About Estonia - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Estonia, a country located in Northern Europe, has a complex and varied history. The territory that is now Estonia has been inhabited since the **Mesolithic Era**, with the first written records of the area dating back to the 1st century AD. The **Viking Age** saw the establishment of trade routes and settlements in the region, while the **Middle Ages** brought the influence of the **Hanseatic League**, a powerful trading federation. In 1219, Estonia was **conquered by Denmark**, and later, in 1346, it was sold to the **Teutonic Order**, a German military order.

In the 16th century, Estonia became a **Swedish province**, and later, in the 18th century, it was **annexed by Russia**. The **Estonian National Awakening** of the 19th century saw a resurgence of Estonian culture and a push for independence. On February 24, 1918, Estonia declared its **independence from Russia**, but this was short-lived, as the country was soon **occupied by Germany** during World War I. After the war, Estonia regained its independence, but it was **annexed by the Soviet Union** in 1940. Estonia remained under Soviet control until August 20, 1991, when it declared its **independence from the Soviet Union**.
