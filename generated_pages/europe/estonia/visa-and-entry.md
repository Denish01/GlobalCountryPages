# Estonia Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Estonia before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Estonia has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter visa-free for short-term stays. As a member of the Schengen Area, Estonia's visa policy is aligned with other European Union countries. Citizens of over 60 countries can enter Estonia without a visa for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. This includes citizens of the United States, Canada, Australia, and many European countries. However, citizens of other countries may need to apply for a visa before entering Estonia.

Estonia's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade while maintaining national security. The country has a well-developed e-government system, which allows applicants to submit their visa applications online. Estonia also offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations.

**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may need to apply for a visa, depending on their nationality. They must have an invitation letter from an Estonian company, proof of business activities, and health insurance. The requirements for business travelers are similar to those for tourists, but they may need to provide additional documentation.
**Students:** Students must apply for a long-term visa (D-visa) to study in Estonia. They must have proof of enrollment in an Estonian university, sufficient funds, and health insurance. The duration of the visa is typically one year, and it can be extended.
**Workers:** Workers must apply for a work permit and a long-term visa (D-visa) to work in Estonia.

The requirements for workers are more stringent than those for tourists or business travelers, and the process can take several months.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The main airports in Estonia are Tallinn Airport (TLL) and Tartu Airport (TAY). The country also has several land borders with Latvia and Russia. When entering Estonia, visitors must go through immigration control, where they will need to present their passport, visa (if required), and other documents. The immigration officer may ask questions about the purpose of the visit, the length of stay, and the visitor's plans. Visitors must also declare any goods they are bringing with them, including gifts and souvenirs.

Estonia has a well-organized border control system, and the process is usually smooth and efficient. However, visitors should be prepared to wait in line, especially during peak travel seasons. It is also important to ensure that all documents are in order and that the visitor has all the necessary information and contacts in case of an emergency.
