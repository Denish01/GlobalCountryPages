[SECTION] Overview: Estonia vs Latvia [/SECTION]
Estonia and Latvia are two neighboring countries in the Baltic region of Europe, both offering a unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, Estonia is generally more expensive than Latvia, with higher prices for housing, food, and transportation. This is largely due to Estonia's stronger economy and higher standard of living, with a GDP per capita that is around 7% higher than Latvia's. However, the difference in cost of living between the two countries is not drastic, and both countries offer a relatively affordable lifestyle compared to other European nations.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Estonia has a more developed economy, with a strong focus on technology and innovation, while Latvia's economy is more diversified, with a larger agricultural sector. This difference in economic focus contributes to the variation in cost of living between the two countries. Overall, Latvia is the more affordable option for those looking to live in the Baltic region, but Estonia's higher standard of living and stronger economy may make it a more attractive choice for some.
