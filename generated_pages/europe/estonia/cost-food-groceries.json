The country relies heavily on imports, which drives up the cost of food. However, the eating-out culture in Estonia is not as prevalent as in other European countries, and many people prefer to cook at home. This is reflected in the relatively high prices of restaurant meals, especially in the capital city of Tallinn. On the other hand, groceries can be relatively affordable, especially if you opt for local products and shop at markets or discount stores.\n\nThe prices of food in Estonia are also influenced by the country's high standard of living and the relatively high GDP per capita. The inflation rate in Estonia is around 3.5%, which is relatively low compared to other European countries. However, the cost of living in Estonia is still relatively high, especially in the capital city. To save money on food, it's a good idea to shop at local markets or discount stores, and to opt for local products instead of imported ones. Eating out can be expensive, but there are also many affordable options available, especially if you're willing to try some of the local street food or eat at smaller, family-run restaurants.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 1.30 EUR | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.50 | 2.20 EUR | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 1.80 EUR | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2.50 | 2.20 EUR | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $8.00 | 7.00 EUR | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12.00 | 10.50 EUR | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 2.60 EUR | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $3.50 | 3.10 EUR | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 1.30 EUR | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.50 | 1.30 EUR | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10.00 | 8.80 EUR | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.50 | 1.30 EUR | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (typical dishes like verivorst or mulgikapsad) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-$50 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $60-$100 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, but they often have a wider selection of products and longer opening hours. Local markets, on the other hand, can be a great place to find fresh produce and local products at lower prices. However, the selection can be limited, and the opening hours may be shorter. It's a good idea to shop at local markets for fresh produce and meat, and to opt for supermarkets for packaged goods and other essentials.\n\nIn general, the prices at local markets are around 10-20% lower than at supermarkets. However, the quality of the products can also vary, and it's a good idea to check the prices and the quality of the products before making a purchase. Bargaining is not common in Estonia, and most vendors will not be willing to negotiate the prices. However, some markets may have special deals or discounts, especially for bulk purchases. It's a good idea to ask the vendor about any available discounts or promotions.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Estonia is to try some of the local street food, such as verivorst (blood sausage) or mulgikapsad (mashed potato and sauerkraut dish).\n- Local staples like rye bread, potatoes, and cabbage are relatively affordable and can be a good value.\n- Avoid buying imported products, especially meat and dairy, as they can be expensive.\n- Opt for local beer instead of imported beer, as it's usually cheaper and just as good.\n- Try some of the local markets, such as the Tallinn Central Market, to find fresh produce and local products at lower prices.\n- Consider shopping at discount stores, such as Lidl or Selver, to find affordable groceries and household essentials.",
