        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Estonia, a country located in Northern Europe, has a complex and varied history. The territory that is now Estonia has been inhabited since the <strong>Mesolithic Era</strong>, with the first written records of the area dating back to the 1st century AD. The <strong>Viking Age</strong> saw the establishment of trade routes and settlements in the region, while the <strong>Middle Ages</strong> brought the influence of the <strong>Hanseatic League</strong>, a powerful trading federation. In 1219, Estonia was <strong>conquered by Denmark</strong>, and later, in 1346, it was sold to the <strong>Teutonic Order</strong>, a German military order.</p>
        <p>In the 16th century, Estonia became a <strong>Swedish province</strong>, and later, in the 18th century, it was <strong>annexed by Russia</strong>. The <strong>Estonian National Awakening</strong> of the 19th century saw a resurgence of Estonian culture and a push for independence. On February 24, 1918, Estonia declared its <strong>independence from Russia</strong>, but this was short-lived, as the country was soon <strong>occupied by Germany</strong> during World War I. After the war, Estonia regained its independence, but it was <strong>annexed by the Soviet Union</strong> in 1940. Estonia remained under Soviet control until August 20, 1991, when it declared its <strong>independence from the Soviet Union</strong>.</p>
        <p>Estonia's history has been marked by periods of foreign rule, with the country being influenced by various cultures, including <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Swedish</strong>, and <strong>Russian</strong>. Despite this, the Estonian people have maintained their unique cultural identity, including their <strong>language</strong>, which is a <strong>Finno-Ugric language</strong> and not an <strong>Indo-European language</strong> like many of its neighboring countries. Today, Estonia is a <strong>sovereign state</strong>, a member of the <strong>European Union</strong> and <strong>NATO</strong>, and has a <strong>parliamentary system of government</strong>.</p>
        <p>Estonia's history has also been marked by significant <strong>economic developments</strong>, including the country's transition from a <strong>planned economy</strong> to a <strong>market-based economy</strong> after gaining independence from the Soviet Union. This transition has led to significant <strong>economic growth</strong>, with Estonia becoming one of the most <strong>digitally advanced countries</strong> in the world.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Estonia is a part of Russia"</p>
        <p>Reality: Estonia is a sovereign state and a member of the European Union and NATO, with its own government and economy. While Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, it declared its independence in 1991 and has since maintained its sovereignty. [/CALLOUT]</p>

Additionally, Estonia has a growing <strong>expat community</strong>, with many people moving to the country for work or study. [/CALLOUT]</p>
