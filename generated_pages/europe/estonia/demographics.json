The country has a high percentage of urban population, with around 68% of the population living in cities, particularly in the capital city of Tallinn. Estonia has also experienced a significant decline in population between 1990 and 2010 due to low birth rates and high emigration rates, but the trend has started to reverse in recent years. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit slowly, driven by increasing life expectancy and a gradual increase in fertility rates.\n\nThe population of Estonia is also characterized by a high level of education, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This has contributed to the country's highly developed economy and innovative society. Estonia has also been actively promoting immigration and attracting foreign talent to supplement its workforce and mitigate the effects of an aging population. The government has implemented various initiatives to support the integration of immigrants and to promote a more diverse and inclusive society.\n\nEstonia's population trends are also influenced by its geographical location and cultural context. The country shares borders with Latvia and Russia, and its proximity to Finland has facilitated cultural and economic exchange. The country's history, including its period of Soviet occupation, has also shaped its demographic profile, with a significant proportion of the population having family ties to other European countries.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Estonians | 68.5% | Throughout the country | Native population |\n| Russians | 24.8% | Northeastern Estonia, Tallinn | Largest minority group |\n| Ukrainians | 1.7% | Urban areas, particularly Tallinn | Recent immigrants |\n| Belarusians | 1.0% | Urban areas, particularly Tallinn | Recent immigrants |\n| Finns | 0.6% | Eastern Estonia, near the Finnish border | Historical ties to Finland |\n| Other | 3.4% | Throughout the country | Includes Latvians, Lithuanians, and others |\nEstonia's ethnic diversity is a result of its complex history, including the period of Soviet occupation, which led to the settlement of people from other parts of the Soviet Union.
