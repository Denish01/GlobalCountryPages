  "content": "Estonia is generally more expensive than Latvia, with an overall cost of living difference of around 10-15%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEstonia GDP per Capita (PPP): 31,400\nLatvia GDP per Capita (PPP): 29,300\nEstonia Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nLatvia Inflation Rate: 2.1%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Latvia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Estonia vs Latvia [/SECTION]\nEstonia and Latvia are two neighboring countries in the Baltic region of Europe, both offering a unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, Estonia is generally more expensive than Latvia, with higher prices for housing, food, and transportation. This is largely due to Estonia's stronger economy and higher standard of living, with a GDP per capita that is around 7% higher than Latvia's. However, the difference in cost of living between the two countries is not drastic, and both countries offer a relatively affordable lifestyle compared to other European nations.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Estonia has a more developed economy, with a strong focus on technology and innovation, while Latvia's economy is more diversified, with a larger agricultural sector. This difference in economic focus contributes to the variation in cost of living between the two countries. Overall, Latvia is the more affordable option for those looking to live in the Baltic region, but Estonia's higher standard of living and stronger economy may make it a more attractive choice for some.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Estonia (USD) | Latvia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 550 | 450 | 22% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 350 | 280 | 25% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 900 | 700 | 29% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Estonia (USD) | Latvia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 12 | 25% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 250 | 20% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 2.50 | 20% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 2.50 | 2 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Estonia (USD) | Latvia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 25 | 20% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.50 | 1.20 | 25% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.10 | 9% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Estonia (USD) | Latvia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 120 | 25% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 25 | 20 | 25% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 33% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Estonia (USD) | Latvia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 1,000 | 17% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,800 | 1,500 | 20% |\n| Comfortable | 2,500 | 2,000 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Estonia is cheaper for:**\n- Public transportation, with a more comprehensive and efficient system\n- Digital services, with a highly developed e-government and digital infrastructure\n- Education, with a strong focus on technology and innovation\n- Healthcare, with a well-regarded public healthcare system\n- **Latvia is cheaper for:**\n- Housing, with lower prices for apartments and houses\n- Food, with lower prices for groceries and dining out\n- Utilities, with lower prices for electricity, water, and heating\n- Transportation, with lower prices for fuel and taxis\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nEstonia and Latvia both offer a unique and affordable lifestyle, but the choice between the two ultimately depends on individual preferences and priorities.
