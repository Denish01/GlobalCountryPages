[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Austria's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being generally considered to be of high quality and free or subsidized for local students. The language of instruction is predominantly German, although some schools may offer instruction in other languages, such as English. Compulsory education lasts for 9 years, typically from ages 6 to 15, and is followed by optional secondary education. International schools are available in major cities, such as Vienna, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.

The quality of education in Austria is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and vocational training. Public schools are well-funded and well-equipped, with small class sizes and experienced teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, may offer additional amenities and services, such as extracurricular activities and language support, but may also come with higher fees. International schools may offer a more diverse range of curricula and teaching styles, but may also be more expensive than public or private schools.
