  "content": "The population of Austria is comprised of approximately 9.1 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a unique cultural melting pot in the heart of Europe.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 9.1 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.3%\nMedian Age: 43.8 years\nUrban Population: 58%\nPopulation Density: 109 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 81.1 years\nFertility Rate: 1.5 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nAustria's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but its growth rate has been steady over the years. The country has experienced a moderate influx of migrants, particularly from Eastern European countries, which has contributed to its population growth. Urbanization is a significant trend in Austria, with over 58% of the population residing in urban areas, such as Vienna, Graz, and Linz. The population density is relatively high, with an average of 109 people per square kilometer. Austria's population is also characterized by a high life expectancy, with an average lifespan of 81.1 years, and a relatively low fertility rate, with an average of 1.5 children per woman.\n\nThe population growth rate in Austria is influenced by a combination of factors, including natural increase and net migration. The country has a relatively low birth rate, but a significant number of immigrants have helped to offset this decline. The majority of immigrants come from other European countries, particularly Germany, Romania, and Hungary. Austria's population is also aging, with a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and older. This demographic shift has significant implications for the country's pension system, healthcare, and social services.\n\nAustria's urban areas are hubs for economic activity, innovation, and culture, attracting people from all over the world. The capital city, Vienna, is a major draw for tourists, students, and professionals, and is known for its high standard of living, rich cultural heritage, and excellent infrastructure. Other major cities, such as Graz and Linz, are also experiencing significant growth and development, driven by their strong economies and high quality of life.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Austrians | 80% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Germans | 2.5% | Border regions | Significant minority |\n| Turks | 2.2% | Urban areas | Large immigrant community |\n| Serbs | 2% | Eastern regions | Significant minority |\n| Croats | 1.5% | Eastern regions | Recognized minority group |\n| Hungarians | 1% | Eastern regions | Recognized minority group |\n| Slovenes | 0.5% | Southern regions | Recognized minority group |\n[/TABLE]\nAustria's ethnic landscape is characterized by a dominant Austrian population, with significant minority groups, including Germans, Turks, Serbs, Croats, Hungarians, and Slovenes.
