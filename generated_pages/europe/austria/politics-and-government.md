[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Austrian government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, ensuring that each branch has distinct roles and responsibilities. The federal government is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, defense, and economic policy, while the nine states have significant autonomy in areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The **federal system** allows for a balance between national unity and regional diversity, with each state having its own government and parliament.

The Austrian political system is characterized by a **parliamentary democracy**, where the head of government is accountable to the legislature. The National Council, the lower house of parliament, is composed of 183 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The Federal Council, the upper house, represents the interests of the states and has 61 members appointed by the state governments. The **parliamentary system** allows for a strong role for political parties, with coalition governments being the norm.

Austria has a long tradition of **consensus politics**, with a strong emphasis on compromise and cooperation between political parties. This approach has contributed to the country's stability and prosperity, with a strong economy and high standard of living. However, it has also been criticized for leading to a lack of clear policy direction and accountability.
