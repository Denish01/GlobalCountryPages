The rental market is subject to strict regulations, with tenants enjoying strong rights and protections. Typical lease terms range from one to three years, with a deposit requirement of two to three months' rent. The country's housing costs are generally higher compared to its regional neighbors, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, but lower than those in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The Austrian government has implemented various measures to control rent prices and ensure affordability, including rent caps and subsidies for low-income households.\n\nThe rental market in Austria is also influenced by the country's strong economy and high standard of living. The **GDP per capita** is one of the highest in the world, and the country's **inflation rate** is relatively low, which contributes to a stable and predictable housing market.
