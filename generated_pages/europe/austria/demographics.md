Austria's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but its growth rate has been steady over the years.

Austria's population is also characterized by a high life expectancy, with an average lifespan of 81.1 years, and a relatively low fertility rate, with an average of 1.5 children per woman.

The population growth rate in Austria is influenced by a combination of factors, including natural increase and net migration.

This demographic shift has significant implications for the country's pension system, healthcare, and social services.
