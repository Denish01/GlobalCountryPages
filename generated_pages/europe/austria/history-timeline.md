# Austria History — Key Events & Timeline

Austria's history spans over 2,000 years, from the ancient Celtic and Roman periods to its current status as a sovereign state in the European Union.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
Austria's history began with the ancient Celtic tribes, who inhabited the region from around 450 BCE. The Romans later conquered the area, establishing the province of Noricum in 15 BCE. With the fall of the Roman Empire, various Germanic tribes, including the Bavarians and the Alemanni, settled in the region. In the 8th century, Charlemagne incorporated the area into the Frankish Empire, and it later became a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire. The **Habsburg** dynasty, which ruled Austria from the 13th century, played a significant role in shaping the country's history, with notable figures such as **Rudolf of Habsburg** and **Maria Theresa**. The 19th and 20th centuries saw significant upheaval, including the Napoleonic Wars, the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the rise of Nazi Germany.
