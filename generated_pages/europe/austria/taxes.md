[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Austria has a **worldwide taxation** system, meaning that residents are taxed on their global income, regardless of where it is earned.

To be considered a tax resident in Austria, an individual must have a **permanent home** or **habitual abode** in the country, or spend more than 183 days in a calendar year in Austria. The tax system is overseen by the Austrian Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing tax laws.

The Austrian tax system is based on the principle of **tax neutrality**, which means that the tax burden should be distributed fairly and evenly among taxpayers. The tax system is also designed to promote **economic growth** and **investment**, with various incentives and deductions available for businesses and individuals. Austria is a member of the European Union and has a well-developed tax treaty network, which helps to prevent double taxation and promote international trade and investment.
