The language of instruction is predominantly German, although some schools may offer instruction in other languages, such as English. Compulsory education lasts for 9 years, typically from ages 6 to 15, and is followed by optional secondary education. International schools are available in major cities, such as Vienna, and offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.\n\nThe quality of education in Austria is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and vocational training. Public schools are well-funded and well-equipped, with small class sizes and experienced teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, may offer additional amenities and services, such as extracurricular activities and language support, but may also come with higher fees. International schools may offer a more diverse range of curricula and teaching styles, but may also be more expensive than public or private schools.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 - $1,000 | Free or subsidized for local students, with some costs for materials and extras |\n| Private Primary | $5,000 - $15,000 | Range of fees depending on the school and location, with higher-end schools offering additional amenities |\n| Public Secondary | $0 - $1,500 | Free or subsidized for local students, with some costs for materials and extras |\n| Private Secondary | $8,000 - $25,000 | Range of fees depending on the school and location, with higher-end schools offering additional amenities |\n| International School | $10,000 - $30,000 | Range of fees depending on the school and curriculum, with higher-end schools offering additional amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $0 - $1,500 | $5,000 - $15,000 | Free or subsidized for local students, with some costs for materials and extras |\n| Private University | $8,000 - $20,000 | $10,000 - $30,000 | Range of fees depending on the institution and location |\n| Top-Ranked University | $10,000 - $25,000 | $15,000 - $35,000 | Fees for top-ranked universities, such as the University of Vienna |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $500 - $1,500 | Range of fees depending on the provider and location |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $50 - $100 | Range of fees depending on the tutor and subject |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $200 - $500 | Range of fees depending on the provider and level |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100 - $300 | Range of costs depending on the school and materials required |\n| School Uniform | $50 - $100 | One-time cost for school uniforms, if required |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Austria are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and teaching styles.\n- Scholarship availability is limited, but some institutions may offer merit-based or need-based scholarships to international students.\n- Online learning options are available, but may not be as comprehensive as traditional classroom-based education.\n- Education quality in Austria is generally considered to be high, compared to the rest of the region.\n- **German language skills** are highly valued in Austria, and students who are proficient in German may have an advantage in the job market.\n- Students should research and compare fees and services carefully before choosing an institution, as costs can vary significantly depending on the type of school and location.",
