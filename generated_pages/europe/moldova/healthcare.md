[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Moldova's healthcare system is structured around a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The quality of care in Moldova's public healthcare system can be inconsistent, with better-equipped and staffed facilities generally found in urban areas like Chisinau. Rural areas often struggle with outdated equipment, insufficient staff, and limited access to specialized care. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality care but at a significantly higher cost, making it inaccessible to many Moldovans.

The public healthcare system in Moldova is generally considered to be underfunded, which can lead to shortages of medical supplies and equipment. Despite these challenges, Moldova has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including the introduction of new medical technologies and the training of healthcare professionals. However, the system still faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of accessibility and affordability for rural populations.

Urban areas like Chisinau have a higher concentration of healthcare providers and facilities, including specialized hospitals and clinics. In contrast, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services, with many villages relying on small, under-equipped clinics or traveling long distances to reach larger hospitals. This disparity in access to healthcare can have significant implications for the health and wellbeing of rural populations, who may be more likely to experience delays in diagnosis and treatment.
