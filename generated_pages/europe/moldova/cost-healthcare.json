  "content": "In Moldova, the cost of healthcare can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with the average health expenditure per capita being around $452 per year. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $452 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 27.5% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 903 or 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: MDL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMoldova has a mixed healthcare system that combines public and private services, with both options available to locals and foreigners. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private services, but it is more affordable. Locals often rely on the public system for basic medical care, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private services, which offer better facilities and more qualified medical staff. Having health insurance is recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help cover the costs of medical services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Moldova is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for setting healthcare policies and standards. However, the system is often underfunded, which can lead to shortages of medical supplies and equipment, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, Moldova has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including the introduction of new medical technologies and the training of medical staff. For foreigners, it is often recommended to have international health insurance that covers them in Moldova, as local insurance options may not provide the same level of coverage.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-15 | $20-50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's experience |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-30 | $50-100 | Prices depend on the specialty and doctor's qualifications |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | Prices vary depending on the dentist and services required |\n| Eye Exam | $5-15 | $20-30 | Prices depend on the type of exam and equipment used |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-10 | $10-20 | Prices vary depending on the lab and tests required |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Prices depend on the hospital and services required |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-50 | Prices vary depending on the hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-500 | Prices depend on the type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $200-500 | Prices vary depending on the hospital and services required |\n| MRI Scan | $100-200 | Prices depend on the hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-20 | Prices vary depending on the hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Covers medical services worldwide, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally affordable, with prices starting from around $5-10 per medication\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available in pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices starting from around $2-5 per medication\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with many medications requiring a doctor's prescription\n- Common medications, such as painkillers and antibiotics, are widely available\n- Some medications may be unavailable or difficult to find, particularly in rural areas\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 903 or 112, which will connect you to the local ambulance service. Ambulances are generally well-equipped and staffed by trained medical personnel, but response times may vary depending on the location. For foreigners, it is often recommended to go to a private hospital, which may offer better quality care and more English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Moldova include the Medpark International Hospital and the Clinica Medsan, which offer a wide range of medical services and have English-speaking staff. It is always a good idea to have a list of emergency contact numbers and hospital locations handy, particularly if you are traveling to rural areas.",
