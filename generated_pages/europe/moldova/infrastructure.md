# Moldova Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Moldova's infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped compared to other European countries, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, but the country has made efforts to improve its roads, energy sector, and telecommunications in recent years.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 71%
Road Network: 9,352 km, with 90% paved
Rail Network: 1,232 km
Major Airports: 1 international
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Moldova's infrastructure development level is generally considered to be at a lower stage compared to other European countries. The country has faced significant challenges in developing its infrastructure due to limited financial resources and a lack of investment. However, in recent years, Moldova has made efforts to improve its infrastructure, with a focus on road rehabilitation, energy sector reform, and the development of its telecommunications sector. The urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development is significant, with urban areas generally having better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.

The government of Moldova has implemented several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a national infrastructure strategy and the establishment of a public-private partnership framework to attract investment in the sector. Additionally, Moldova has received significant support from international organizations such as the European Union, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which have provided financing and technical assistance for various infrastructure projects.

Despite these efforts, Moldova still faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure development, including a lack of funding, institutional capacity, and coordination among different government agencies. Furthermore, the country's infrastructure sector is heavily dependent on external financing, which can create vulnerabilities and risks for the economy.
