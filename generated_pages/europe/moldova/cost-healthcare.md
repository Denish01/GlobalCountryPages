[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Moldova has a mixed healthcare system that combines public and private services, with both options available to locals and foreigners. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private services, but it is more affordable. Locals often rely on the public system for basic medical care, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private services, which offer better facilities and more qualified medical staff. Having health insurance is recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help cover the costs of medical services.

The healthcare system in Moldova is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for setting healthcare policies and standards. However, the system is often underfunded, which can lead to shortages of medical supplies and equipment, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, Moldova has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including the introduction of new medical technologies and the training of medical staff. For foreigners, it is often recommended to have international health insurance that covers them in Moldova, as local insurance options may not provide the same level of coverage.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 903 or 112, which will connect you to the local ambulance service. Ambulances are generally well-equipped and staffed by trained medical personnel, but response times may vary depending on the location. For foreigners, it is often recommended to go to a private hospital, which may offer better quality care and more English-speaking staff.

It is always a good idea to have a list of emergency contact numbers and hospital locations handy, particularly if you are traveling to rural areas.
