        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Moldova, officially known as the Republic of Moldova, is a <strong>sovereign</strong> state located in <strong>Europe</strong>. The country has a complex history, with various periods of rule by different empires and dynasties. The territory that is now Moldova was first inhabited by ancient civilizations, including the Dacians and the Romans. In the 13th century, the Principality of Moldavia was established, and it existed as a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire from the 16th century until the 19th century. In 1812, the territory was annexed by the Russian Empire, and it remained under Russian rule until the Russian Revolution in 1917.</p>
        <p>After the Russian Revolution, Moldova declared its independence and became part of the Kingdom of Romania. However, in 1940, the territory was annexed by the Soviet Union, and it became the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. Moldova remained under Soviet rule until it declared its independence on August 27, 1991. The country has been a member of the United Nations since 1992 and has been a part of various international organizations, including the Council of Europe and the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Moldova's history has been shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. The country has been influenced by various cultures, including Romanian, Russian, and Ukrainian. The official language of Moldova is <strong>Romanian</strong>, and the majority of the population identifies as ethnic Moldovan. The country has a diverse geography, with a mix of forests, hills, and plains. The capital city, <strong>Chisinau</strong>, is the largest city in the country and is home to many cultural and historical landmarks.</p>
        <p>Moldova's independence was recognized by the international community, and the country has since developed its own government, economy, and institutions. The country has a <strong>presidential</strong> system, with a president serving as head of state and a prime minister serving as head of government. The country has a <strong>parliamentary</strong> system, with a unicameral legislature. Moldova has also developed its own currency, the <strong>Moldovan leu</strong> (MDL), and has established its own central bank.</p>
