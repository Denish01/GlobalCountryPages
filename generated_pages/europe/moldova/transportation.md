[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Moldova has one main international airport, Chisinau International Airport (KIV), which is located about 13 kilometers southeast of the capital city Chisinau. The airport receives direct flights from several European cities, including Bucharest, Istanbul, and Moscow, as well as connecting flights from major European hubs like Frankfurt and Paris. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from Romania and Ukraine being the most common. The most popular entry points from Romania are at Sculeni, Ungheni, and Giurgiulesti, while from Ukraine, the most common entry points are at Reni, Otaci, and Palanca.

To get to Moldova by land, you can take a bus or drive from neighboring countries. The journey from Bucharest, Romania, takes around 6-8 hours by bus or car, depending on traffic and road conditions. From Ukraine, the journey can take longer, around 10-12 hours, depending on the route and border crossing. It's also possible to take a train from Romania or Ukraine, but the journey can be quite long and may involve changes of trains. [CALLOUT] Be sure to check the latest border crossing requirements and regulations before traveling to Moldova by land.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Moldova has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airline is Air Moldova, which operates flights from Chisinau to the northern city of Balti. However, due to the country's small size, domestic flights are not a common mode of transportation, and most people prefer to travel by bus or car. If you do need to book a domestic flight, it's best to do so in advance, as prices can be quite high and availability may be limited. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $50 to $100, depending on the airline and route.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Moldova has a moderate rail network, with trains connecting the capital city Chisinau to other major cities like Balti, Orhei, and Cahul. The rail network is operated by the state-owned company Calea Ferată din Moldova (CFM), and trains are generally comfortable and reliable. However, the journey can be quite slow, with average speeds of around 40-50 km/h. There are no high-speed train options in Moldova, but you can book a seat in a first-class carriage for a more comfortable journey. The booking process is relatively straightforward, with tickets available at train stations or online through the CFM website. [RATING] The train network in Moldova is 3/5, with room for improvement in terms of speed and frequency.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses and coaches are a popular mode of transportation in Moldova, with many private companies operating routes between cities and towns. The main bus station in Chisinau is the Central Bus Station (Autogara Centrală), which offers connections to most cities in the country. Bus companies like Transgaz, Transnistria, and Floare de Colt operate modern and comfortable coaches, with prices starting from around $5-10 for a one-way ticket. The journey can be quite long, especially to rural areas, but buses are generally a reliable and affordable option. You can book tickets in advance at the bus station or through the company's website.
