[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Moldova has a lower-middle-income economy, with a mix of industrial and agricultural sectors. The country's economic development has been hindered by its landlocked location, lack of natural resources, and dependence on external factors such as trade with neighboring countries. Despite these challenges, Moldova has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing services sector and increasing foreign investment. The economy is driven primarily by domestic consumption and remittances from abroad, with a significant portion of the population working abroad and sending money back to their families.

Moldova's economic classification as a lower-middle-income country reflects its limited economic diversification and vulnerability to external shocks. The country's development level is also influenced by its transition from a planned to a market-based economy, which has led to significant reforms and liberalization efforts. However, the economy remains susceptible to fluctuations in global commodity prices, weather conditions, and regional conflicts.

The country's economic trajectory has been shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Moldova has sought to strengthen its ties with the European Union, while also maintaining good relations with neighboring countries, particularly Romania and Ukraine. This has led to increased trade and investment opportunities, as well as cooperation in areas such as energy and transportation.
