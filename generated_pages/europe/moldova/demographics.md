[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Moldova's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but its growth trends and urbanization patterns are noteworthy. The country has experienced a decline in population due to low fertility rates and outward migration, particularly among young people seeking better economic opportunities abroad. Urbanization is a significant trend, with over 43% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Chisinau. Migration patterns have also played a crucial role in shaping the country's demographics, with many Moldovans seeking work in other European countries or Russia.

The population of Moldova is expected to continue declining in the coming years, with significant implications for the country's economy and social security systems. The decline in population is also expected to lead to an aging population, with a growing proportion of older citizens and a shrinking workforce. To address these challenges, the government has implemented policies aimed at increasing fertility rates and encouraging migration back to the country.

Moldova's population size and growth trends are also influenced by its geographic location and economic conditions. The country is situated between Romania and Ukraine, and its economy is heavily dependent on agriculture and manufacturing. The population's growth trends and urbanization patterns are also shaped by the country's history, culture, and traditions.
