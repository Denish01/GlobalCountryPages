[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Moldova's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the quality of services can vary depending on the region and provider. The costs of utilities in Moldova have been relatively stable in recent years, but they can fluctuate due to factors such as inflation and changes in global energy prices. Seasonal variation also plays a role, with higher electricity and gas consumption during the winter months (December to February) and lower consumption during the summer months (June to August).

The Moldovan government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency, which has helped to stabilize utility costs. However, the country is still heavily reliant on imported energy sources, which can make it vulnerable to price fluctuations. As a result, utility costs can vary from year to year, and consumers may need to adjust their budgets accordingly.
