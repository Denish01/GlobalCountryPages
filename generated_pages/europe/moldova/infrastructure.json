  "content": "Moldova's infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped compared to other European countries, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, but the country has made efforts to improve its roads, energy sector, and telecommunications in recent years.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 71%\nRoad Network: 9,352 km, with 90% paved\nRail Network: 1,232 km\nMajor Airports: 1 international\nMajor Ports: 0, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMoldova's infrastructure development level is generally considered to be at a lower stage compared to other European countries. The country has faced significant challenges in developing its infrastructure due to limited financial resources and a lack of investment. However, in recent years, Moldova has made efforts to improve its infrastructure, with a focus on road rehabilitation, energy sector reform, and the development of its telecommunications sector. The urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development is significant, with urban areas generally having better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.\n\nThe government of Moldova has implemented several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a national infrastructure strategy and the establishment of a public-private partnership framework to attract investment in the sector. Additionally, Moldova has received significant support from international organizations such as the European Union, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which have provided financing and technical assistance for various infrastructure projects.\n\nDespite these efforts, Moldova still faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure development, including a lack of funding, institutional capacity, and coordination among different government agencies. Furthermore, the country's infrastructure sector is heavily dependent on external financing, which can create vulnerabilities and risks for the economy.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 9,352 km | Moderate | 90% paved, with significant regional disparities |\n| Railways | 1,232 km | Poor | Limited capacity and outdated infrastructure |\n| Airports | 1 international, 2 domestic | Good | Chisinau International Airport is the main hub |\n| Ports | 0 | N/A | Landlocked, with no major ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Moldova's power generation is largely dependent on **imported gas** from Russia and Ukraine, with a small share of **renewable energy** sources such as wind and solar power.\n- The country's energy sector is characterized by **low energy efficiency** and a lack of investment in new generation capacity.\n- Moldova has made efforts to **diversify its energy mix** and reduce its dependence on imported gas, including the development of a national energy strategy and the implementation of energy efficiency measures.\n- The country's power grid is **relatively reliable**, with few outages and disruptions reported in recent years.\n- Moldova has set a target to increase the share of **renewable energy** in its energy mix to 20% by 2025, with a focus on wind, solar, and biomass energy.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Moldova's **tap water** is generally considered to be safe to drink, with a high level of access to improved water sources, particularly in urban areas.\n- However, the country's **sanitation coverage** is still relatively low, particularly in rural areas, where many households lack access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- Moldova has made efforts to **improve water access** in rural areas, including the development of a national water strategy and the implementation of projects to extend water supply networks to rural communities.\n- The country's **water management** practices are still relatively underdeveloped, with a lack of effective water conservation measures and a high level of water waste.\n- Moldova has received support from international organizations to **upgrade its water infrastructure**, including the rehabilitation of water treatment plants and the extension of water supply networks.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Moldova's **mobile coverage** is relatively good, with a high level of access to mobile phone services, particularly in urban areas.\n- The country's **fiber-optic network** is still relatively underdeveloped, with limited access to high-speed internet services, particularly in rural areas.\n- Moldova has made efforts to **improve its telecommunications infrastructure**, including the development of a national telecommunications strategy and the implementation of projects to extend fiber-optic networks to rural areas.\n- The country's **4G/5G rollout** is still in its early stages, with limited coverage and availability, particularly in rural areas.\n- Moldova's **postal services** are relatively well-developed, with a wide network of post offices and a range of services available, including mail delivery and parcel services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- Moldova is currently implementing a **major road rehabilitation project**, with funding from the European Union and the World Bank, aimed at improving the country's road network and reducing regional disparities.\n- The country is also developing a **new energy strategy**, with a focus on increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and improving energy efficiency.\n- Moldova has received funding from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to **upgrade its water infrastructure**, including the rehabilitation of water treatment plants and the extension of water supply networks.\n- The country is also implementing a **major telecommunications project**, with funding from the World Bank, aimed at extending fiber-optic networks to rural areas and improving access to high-speed internet services.\n- Moldova has set a target to **increase its energy efficiency** and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on improving the energy efficiency of buildings and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.",
