  "content": "To get around in Moldova, you can use a combination of buses, trains, and taxis, as well as rent a car or use ride-hailing apps, with the capital city Chisinau being the main transportation hub.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Chisinau International Airport (KIV)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: moderate\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: Bolt, Yandex.Taxi\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nMoldova has one main international airport, Chisinau International Airport (KIV), which is located about 13 kilometers southeast of the capital city Chisinau. The airport receives direct flights from several European cities, including Bucharest, Istanbul, and Moscow, as well as connecting flights from major European hubs like Frankfurt and Paris. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from Romania and Ukraine being the most common. The most popular entry points from Romania are at Sculeni, Ungheni, and Giurgiulesti, while from Ukraine, the most common entry points are at Reni, Otaci, and Palanca.\n\nTo get to Moldova by land, you can take a bus or drive from neighboring countries. The journey from Bucharest, Romania, takes around 6-8 hours by bus or car, depending on traffic and road conditions. From Ukraine, the journey can take longer, around 10-12 hours, depending on the route and border crossing. It's also possible to take a train from Romania or Ukraine, but the journey can be quite long and may involve changes of trains. [CALLOUT] Be sure to check the latest border crossing requirements and regulations before traveling to Moldova by land.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nMoldova has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airline is Air Moldova, which operates flights from Chisinau to the northern city of Balti. However, due to the country's small size, domestic flights are not a common mode of transportation, and most people prefer to travel by bus or car. If you do need to book a domestic flight, it's best to do so in advance, as prices can be quite high and availability may be limited. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $50 to $100, depending on the airline and route.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nMoldova has a moderate rail network, with trains connecting the capital city Chisinau to other major cities like Balti, Orhei, and Cahul. The rail network is operated by the state-owned company Calea Ferată din Moldova (CFM), and trains are generally comfortable and reliable. However, the journey can be quite slow, with average speeds of around 40-50 km/h. There are no high-speed train options in Moldova, but you can book a seat in a first-class carriage for a more comfortable journey. The booking process is relatively straightforward, with tickets available at train stations or online through the CFM website. [RATING] The train network in Moldova is 3/5, with room for improvement in terms of speed and frequency.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nBuses and coaches are a popular mode of transportation in Moldova, with many private companies operating routes between cities and towns. The main bus station in Chisinau is the Central Bus Station (Autogara Centrală), which offers connections to most cities in the country. Bus companies like Transgaz, Transnistria, and Floare de Colt operate modern and comfortable coaches, with prices starting from around $5-10 for a one-way ticket. The journey can be quite long, especially to rural areas, but buses are generally a reliable and affordable option. You can book tickets in advance at the bus station or through the company's website.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Chisinau, Balti, Orhei | $0.20-$0.50 | Frequent services, but can be crowded |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $2-$5/km | Metered, but can be expensive for long journeys |\n| Ride-Hailing | Chisinau, Balti | $2-$5 | Bolt and Yandex.Taxi available |\n| Minibus | Chisinau, Balti | $0.50-$1 | Informal, but frequent services |\n| Trolleybus | Chisinau | $0.20-$0.50 | Frequent services, but limited routes |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Moldova, you need a valid driver's license from your home country or an International Driving Permit (IDP).\n- Road conditions in Moldova are generally moderate, with some roads in good condition and others in need of repair.\n- Fuel costs are relatively low, with gasoline and diesel prices starting from around $0.80 per liter.\n- Car rental companies like Europcar, Sixt, and Budget are available in Chisinau and other major cities, with prices starting from around $20 per day.\n- Hazards to watch out for include potholes, speed bumps, and aggressive driving by some locals.\n- Be sure to check the latest road conditions and weather forecast before embarking on a journey, especially during winter months.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Always check the latest exchange rates before traveling to Moldova, as the local currency (MDL) can fluctuate.\n- Be aware of scams targeting tourists, especially in Chisinau, and always use licensed taxis or ride-hailing apps.\n- Download the Bolt or Yandex.Taxi app for easy and affordable transportation in Chisinau and other major cities.\n- Always carry some cash with you, as not all places accept credit or debit cards.\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, especially when visiting rural areas or attending cultural events.\n- Learn some basic Romanian phrases, like \"hello\" (salut), \"thank you\" (mulțumesc), and \"excuse me\" (îmi pare rău), to show respect for the local culture.\n- Be prepared for power outages or internet disruptions, especially in rural areas, and always carry a portable charger and a backup power source.",
