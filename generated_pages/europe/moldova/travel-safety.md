[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Moldova is generally a safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other European countries. The capital city, Chisinau, is a bustling metropolis with a mix of Soviet-era architecture and modern amenities. As with any foreign travel, it's essential to take common-sense precautions to ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip. Visitors can expect a warm welcome from the locals, and the country's compact size makes it easy to explore. However, as with any country, there are areas to avoid and potential risks to be aware of.

Moldova's safety record is relatively good, with low levels of violent crime and petty theft. The country has made significant progress in recent years to improve its law enforcement and tourist infrastructure. However, corruption remains a concern, and visitors may encounter scams or overcharging, particularly in the service industry. Additionally, the country's rural areas can be quite poor, and visitors may encounter beggars or people asking for money. Overall, Moldova is a great destination for travelers who want to experience a unique blend of Eastern European culture and history.
