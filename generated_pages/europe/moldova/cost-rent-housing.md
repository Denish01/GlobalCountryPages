Moldova's rental market is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for renters. Typical lease terms are for 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with renters having the right to a written contract and protection from unfair eviction. Compared to its regional neighbors, Moldova's housing costs are relatively low, with rental prices in Chisinau, the capital city, being lower than in neighboring cities in Romania and Ukraine. However, prices can vary depending on the location, with city center apartments being more expensive than those in the suburbs or rural areas.

The housing market in Moldova is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a GDP per capita of $18,615 and an inflation rate of 4.7%. The government has implemented policies to support the development of the housing sector, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for private developers. As a result, the housing market in Moldova is relatively stable, with a steady demand for rental properties and a growing number of new developments.
