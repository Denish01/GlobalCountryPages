[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Moldova has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with buses, minibuses, and trains connecting major cities and towns. The quality of public transit varies, with some cities having more frequent and reliable services than others. In Chisinau, the capital city, there is a comprehensive network of buses and trolleybuses, making it easy to get around without a car. Most people in Moldova rely on public transportation or walk or cycle for short distances, as the country's roads can be congested and parking spaces limited.

The main transportation modes in Moldova include buses, minibuses, and trains, with buses being the most popular and affordable option. The country's road network is relatively well-maintained, but traffic congestion can be a problem in urban areas. Many people in Moldova also use ride-hailing apps, such as Yandex.Taxi and Bolt, which are widely available and often cheaper than traditional taxis. For longer distances, trains and buses are the most common options, with several daily services connecting major cities and towns.
