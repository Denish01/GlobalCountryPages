[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Moldova's linguistic landscape is dominated by Romanian, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. The language is closely related to other Romance languages, such as Italian and Spanish, and is widely used in all aspects of life, including government, education, and media. Regional dialects of Romanian are also spoken in Moldova, particularly in rural areas, where the language has been influenced by other languages such as Russian and Ukrainian. Minority languages, including Russian, Ukrainian, and Gagauz, are also spoken in Moldova, particularly in urban areas and in regions with significant minority populations. English is not widely understood in Moldova, particularly outside of major cities, and visitors who do not speak Romanian may face communication challenges.

Despite the challenges, many Moldovans, particularly younger people and those in the service industry, are making an effort to learn English, and some may be able to communicate in basic English. However, it is still a good idea for visitors to learn some basic Romanian phrases to help them navigate the country and interact with locals. Romanian is a phonetic language, meaning that words are pronounced as they are written, which can make it easier for visitors to learn and communicate.

Moldova's language situation is also influenced by its history and geography, with the country having been part of the Soviet Union and having a significant Russian-speaking population. As a result, Russian is still widely spoken in Moldova, particularly in urban areas, and many Moldovans are bilingual in Romanian and Russian. However, the use of Russian has declined in recent years, particularly among younger people, who are more likely to speak English or other foreign languages.
