Primary education lasts for four years, from age 7 to 11, and is compulsory for all children. Secondary education is further divided into two stages: lower secondary, which lasts for five years, and upper secondary, which lasts for two to three years. The quality of education in Moldova is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on academic subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. Public schools are free and widely available, while private schools are also an option for those who can afford them. However, the public education system is often underfunded, which can affect the quality of education and the availability of resources.\n\nThe tertiary education system in Moldova includes universities, colleges, and vocational schools, which offer a range of academic programs in fields such as business, engineering, medicine, and the arts. The quality of tertiary education in Moldova is generally considered to be good, with many universities having international partnerships and exchange programs. However, the system is also facing challenges such as brain drain, as many young Moldovans choose to study abroad or emigrate to other countries in search of better opportunities.\n\nThe education system in Moldova is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting policies, standards, and curriculum guidelines. The ministry also provides funding and support for schools and universities, although the level of funding can vary depending on the institution and the location. Overall, the education system in Moldova is well-structured and comprehensive, but it faces challenges such as underfunding, brain drain, and a need for greater internationalization and recognition.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
