[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Guernsey is highly sought after, with a strong demand for both residential and commercial properties. The current market conditions are characterized by a limited supply of properties, which has driven up prices in recent years. The price trajectory is expected to continue on an upward trend, with some areas experiencing higher growth than others. Urban areas, such as Saint Peter Port, tend to be more expensive than rural areas, but they also offer more amenities and a higher quality of life. The market is driven by a mix of local demand and foreign investment, with many buyers attracted to Guernsey's **low tax environment** and **high standard of living**.

The market is also influenced by the island's **limited geographical size**, which restricts the supply of new properties and drives up prices. However, this also makes Guernsey an attractive destination for those looking for a unique and exclusive lifestyle. The government has implemented policies to control the market and ensure that properties are available for local residents, but there are still opportunities for foreign buyers to invest in the island's property market.

In terms of trends, there is a growing demand for **sustainable and eco-friendly properties**, as well as a trend towards **luxury and high-end developments**. This is driven by the increasing popularity of Guernsey as a destination for high-net-worth individuals and families. The market is also seeing a growth in **short-term rentals**, driven by the island's tourism industry.
