[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Guernsey is divided into three branches: the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial**. The **Lieutenant Governor**, appointed by the British monarch, represents the Crown and has ceremonial and symbolic duties. The **Chief Minister**, the head of government, is responsible for the overall direction of the island's domestic and internal affairs. The **States of Deliberation**, the island's parliament, is composed of 45 members, known as **Deputies**, who are elected by the islanders for a four-year term. Guernsey has a **unitary system**, where the central government has the primary authority, and there are no political parties, with members typically being independents.

The separation of powers in Guernsey is designed to provide checks and balances between the different branches of government. The **executive** is responsible for the administration of the island, while the **legislative** branch has the power to make laws and approve the budget. The **judicial** branch is independent and responsible for interpreting the laws. This system ensures that no one branch of government has too much power, and it helps to prevent abuses of authority.

Guernsey's system of government is designed to be flexible and responsive to the needs of the islanders. The **States of Deliberation** can pass laws on a wide range of topics, including education, health, and the environment. The **Chief Minister** and the **Council of Ministers** are responsible for implementing these laws and ensuring that the island is governed effectively.
