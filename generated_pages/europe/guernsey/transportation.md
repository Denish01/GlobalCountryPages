You can also reach Guernsey by sea, with regular ferry services operated by Condor Ferries from Poole, Portsmouth, and St. Malo, as well as from the neighboring island of Jersey.

For those traveling from outside the UK, the most convenient option is to fly into a major UK airport, such as London Heathrow or Gatwick, and then take a connecting flight to Guernsey.

It's worth noting that flight schedules can be limited, especially during the off-season, so it's a good idea to book in advance to secure the best prices.
