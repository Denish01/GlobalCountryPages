[SECTION] How Guernsey Is Divided [/SECTION]
Guernsey is a British Crown dependency, located in the English Channel, and is divided into 10 parishes, each with its own unique character and identity. These parishes are the primary administrative divisions of the island and are responsible for providing various local services, such as waste management, road maintenance, and community facilities. The parishes are also responsible for electing representatives to the States of Deliberation, which is the island's parliament.

The 10 parishes of Guernsey are Saint Peter Port, Saint Sampson, Vale, Castel, Saint Martin, Saint Andrew, Forest, Saint Pierre du Bois, Torteval, and Saint Saviour. Each parish has its own parish council, which is responsible for making decisions on local matters, such as planning and development, and for providing services to the local community. The parish system has been in place for centuries and is an integral part of Guernsey's history and culture.
