[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Guernsey is highly competitive, with a high demand for housing due to the island's limited size and growing population. Typical lease terms are for 12 months, with a minimum of 3 months' notice required for termination. Deposits are usually equivalent to one to two months' rent and are refundable at the end of the tenancy, provided the property is returned in good condition. Tenant rights are protected by the Guernsey **Housing Law**, which regulates issues such as rent increases, eviction, and property maintenance. Compared to regional neighbors like Jersey and the UK, Guernsey's housing costs are relatively high, reflecting the island's unique **micro-economy** and limited housing supply.

The Guernsey housing market is characterized by a mix of modern apartments, historic **townhouses**, and rural **cottage**-style properties. The island's **Local Market** housing sector is restricted to residents who have lived on the island for at least 10 years, while the **Open Market** sector is available to anyone, including non-residents. This dual-market system contributes to the high demand and prices for housing in Guernsey. The island's government has implemented various initiatives to address the housing shortage and affordability issues, including the development of new **affordable housing** schemes and the introduction of **rent control** measures.
