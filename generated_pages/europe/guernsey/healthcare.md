[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Guernsey is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The **National Health Service (NHS)** provides comprehensive coverage for residents, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, some services, such as dental care and optician services, may require additional payment. The quality of care in Guernsey is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. Urban areas, such as Saint Peter Port, have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, but the island's small size ensures that medical help is never far away.

The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of taxes and **social insurance contributions**, which are mandatory for all residents. Private health insurance is also available, and some employers may offer it as a benefit to their employees. Overall, the healthcare system in Guernsey is designed to provide comprehensive and equitable access to medical services for all residents. The **Health and Social Services Department** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system and ensuring that it meets the needs of the island's population.

Guernsey's healthcare system is also influenced by its relationship with the **United Kingdom**, which provides some funding and support for certain healthcare services. This relationship also allows for the exchange of medical professionals and expertise between the two jurisdictions.
