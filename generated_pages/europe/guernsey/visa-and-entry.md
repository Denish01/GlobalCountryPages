[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Guernsey has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free for a specified period. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free agreement with Guernsey may need to apply for a visa before arriving on the island. Guernsey's visa policy is closely tied to that of the United Kingdom, and many countries that have a visa-free agreement with the UK also have one with Guernsey. The island has a relatively liberal visa stance, with over 50 countries eligible for visa-free access, including the US, Canada, Australia, and many European countries.

Guernsey's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate tourism and business travel with the need to maintain the island's security and integrity. The Guernsey government works closely with the UK government to ensure that the island's visa policy is aligned with that of the UK, while also taking into account the unique needs and circumstances of the island. As a result, Guernsey's visa policy is subject to change, and visitors are advised to check the official government website for the latest information before planning their trip.
