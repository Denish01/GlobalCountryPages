Italy has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with most households having access to **electricity**, **water**, and **gas**. The cost of utilities in Italy can fluctuate depending on the region, with northern regions tend to have higher costs than southern regions. The cost of utilities can also vary depending on the usage, with higher consumption resulting in higher bills. Additionally, there can be seasonal variation in utility costs, with winter months tend to have higher heating costs and summer months tend to have higher cooling costs.

The Italian government has implemented measures to regulate utility costs and ensure that they remain stable.
