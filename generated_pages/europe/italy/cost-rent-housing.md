[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Italy is relatively competitive, with a high demand for apartments in city centers, particularly in Rome, Milan, and Florence. Typical lease terms are for one to three years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are well-protected in Italy, with laws governing rent increases, eviction procedures, and maintenance responsibilities. Compared to its regional neighbors, Italy's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Switzerland and Austria, but higher than in Slovenia and San Marino.

Italy's housing market is also influenced by its strong **cultural heritage**, with many historic buildings and neighborhoods being protected by preservation laws. This can limit the supply of new housing and drive up prices in certain areas. Additionally, the Italian government has implemented various initiatives to support affordable housing, including rent control measures and subsidies for low-income families. However, these initiatives can also contribute to a complex and sometimes bureaucratic rental market, making it challenging for foreigners to navigate.
