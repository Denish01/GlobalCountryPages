  "content": "Italy is home to a diverse population of approximately 59 million people, with a mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that contribute to the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 59.0 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.3%\nMedian Age: 46.5 years\nUrban Population: 69%\nPopulation Density: 196 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 83.5 years\nFertility Rate: 1.3 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nItaly's population is one of the largest in the European Union, with a relatively slow growth rate due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit slowly, with a projected increase of 3% by 2030. Urbanization is a significant trend in Italy, with nearly 70% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in the northern regions. Migration patterns also play a crucial role in shaping Italy's demographics, with many immigrants arriving from Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. According to the latest estimates, approximately 10% of Italy's population is foreign-born, with the majority coming from Romania, Albania, and Morocco.\n\nThe population of Italy is also characterized by a significant regional disparity, with the northern regions being more densely populated and economically developed than the southern regions. This disparity has led to a phenomenon known as the \"Mezzogiorno problem,\" where the southern regions struggle with higher unemployment rates, lower GDP per capita, and a general lack of economic development. To address this issue, the Italian government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting economic growth and development in the southern regions.\n\nIn addition to these regional disparities, Italy's population is also facing the challenge of an aging population, with a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and above. This demographic shift has significant implications for the country's pension system, healthcare, and social security. To mitigate these effects, the Italian government has introduced various measures, such as increasing the retirement age and encouraging immigration to supplement the workforce.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Italian | 90% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Sardinian | 2.5% | Sardinia | Autonomous region with unique cultural identity |\n| Sicilian | 2% | Sicily | Island with distinct cultural and linguistic heritage |\n| Lombard | 1.5% | Lombardy | Northern region with distinct dialect and cultural traditions |\n| Venetian | 1% | Veneto | Northeastern region with unique cultural and linguistic identity |\n| Albanian | 0.5% | Southern Italy | Minority group with historical ties to Albania |\n| Romanian | 0.5% | Nationwide | Significant immigrant community |\n| Moroccan | 0.3% | Nationwide | Immigrant community with growing presence |\n[/TABLE]\nItaly's ethnic landscape is characterized by a dominant Italian population, with several minority groups contributing to the country's cultural diversity.
