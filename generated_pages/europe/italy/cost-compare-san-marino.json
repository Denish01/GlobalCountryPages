Italy is a large and diverse country with a population of over 59 million people, while San Marino is a small, independent republic with a population of just over 34,000. The cost of living in Italy is generally lower than in San Marino, thanks to the larger country's more competitive markets and lower prices for many everyday items. However, San Marino's unique location and tax regime make it an attractive destination for some expats and businesses.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Italy has a more developed and diversified economy, with a strong manufacturing sector and a large service industry. San Marino, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a focus on financial services, tourism, and light industry. As a result, San Marino tends to have higher prices for many goods and services, particularly in the areas of housing, food, and transportation. Overall, Italy is the more affordable option for most people, with a cost of living that is around 10-20% lower than in San Marino.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Italy (USD) | San Marino (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 1,200 | 50% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 800 | 60% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 2,500 | 67% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Italy (USD) | San Marino (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 20 | 33% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 400 | 33% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 7 | 40% more |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Italy (USD) | San Marino (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 40 | 33% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 3 | 50% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.50 | 1.80 | 20% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Italy (USD) | San Marino (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 200 | 33% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 33% more |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 30 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Italy (USD) | San Marino (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 2,000 | 25% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 3,500 | 29% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 5,500 | 31% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Italy is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices that are significantly lower than in San Marino\n  - Food and dining, with a wide range of affordable options available\n  - Transportation, with lower prices for fuel, taxis, and public transportation\n  - Utilities and internet, with more competitive prices for basic services\n- **San Marino is cheaper for:**\n  - Taxes, with a unique tax regime that offers significant benefits to residents\n  - Business services, with a range of specialized services available for companies\n  - Luxury goods, with a range of high-end products available in the country's duty-free shops\n  - Healthcare, with a high-quality healthcare system that is widely available to residents\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor most people, Italy is the more affordable option, with a cost of living that is around 10-20% lower than in San Marino.
