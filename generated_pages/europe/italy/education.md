[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The Italian education system is divided into three main stages: **primary education**, **secondary education**, and **tertiary education**. Primary education, also known as **scuola primaria**, lasts for five years and is compulsory for children between the ages of six and eleven. Secondary education, or **scuola secondaria**, is further divided into two stages: **lower secondary school** (scuola secondaria di primo grado) and **upper secondary school** (scuola secondaria di secondo grado). Lower secondary school lasts for three years, while upper secondary school can last for either three or five years, depending on the type of school. Tertiary education, or **università**, offers a range of academic programs, including undergraduate and graduate degrees.

The quality of education in Italy is generally high, with a strong emphasis on **humanities** and **sciences**. Both public and private schools are available, although public schools are generally more affordable and widely accessible. Private schools, on the other hand, often offer more specialized programs and smaller class sizes. The Italian government has implemented various reforms in recent years to improve the education system, including the introduction of **digital classrooms** and **vocational training programs**.

Italy's education system is also known for its **rigorous academic standards**, with students typically taking a series of exams throughout their academic careers. The **maturità** exam, taken at the end of upper secondary school, is a particularly important milestone, as it determines a student's eligibility for university admission. Overall, the Italian education system provides students with a well-rounded education and a strong foundation for future academic and professional success.
