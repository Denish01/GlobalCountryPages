# Italy Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Italy before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Italy has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa for short-term stays. The country is a member of the European Union (EU) and the Schengen Area, which means that EU citizens can enter Italy without a visa and stay for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Non-EU citizens, on the other hand, may need a visa to enter Italy, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit. Currently, citizens of over 60 countries can enter Italy without a visa for tourism or business stays of up to 90 days.

Italy's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade while maintaining national security and immigration controls. The country has a well-developed visa system, with various types of visas available for different purposes, including tourism, business, study, and work. Visitors can apply for a visa at an Italian embassy or consulate in their home country, and the application process typically involves submitting required documents and attending an interview.
