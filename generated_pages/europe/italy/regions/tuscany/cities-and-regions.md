[SECTION] How Tuscany Is Divided [/SECTION]
Tuscany is a region in central Italy, divided into ten provinces, each with its own capital city. The provinces are further divided into communes, which are the basic administrative units of the region. The provincial capitals are the main urban centers, and they serve as the economic, cultural, and administrative hubs of their respective provinces. The regional government is based in Florence, which is also the largest city and the capital of Tuscany.

The administrative structure of Tuscany is designed to promote local autonomy and self-government, while also ensuring that the region as a whole is well-coordinated and managed. The regional government has a range of responsibilities, including education, healthcare, transportation, and environmental protection, while the provincial and communal governments have more limited powers and focus on local issues.
