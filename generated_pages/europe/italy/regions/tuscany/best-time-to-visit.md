[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Tuscany has a **Mediterranean climate**, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The region can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal area, which has a milder climate, and the inland area, which has a more **continental climate**. The dry season, from May to October, is the best time to visit Tuscany, with warm weather and low humidity, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as **hiking**, **cycling**, and **wine tasting**. The wet season, from November to April, is characterized by cool and rainy weather, making it less suitable for outdoor activities.

The seasons in Tuscany have a significant impact on travel, with the peak tourist season, from June to August, being the busiest and most expensive time to visit. During this time, the region's **beaches**, **towns**, and **attractions** are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are at their highest. The shoulder season, from April to May and September to October, is a great time to visit Tuscany, with mild weather, smaller crowds, and lower prices.
