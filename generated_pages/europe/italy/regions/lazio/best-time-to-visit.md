[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Lazio is a region in central Italy, and its climate is characterized by hot summers and mild winters. The region can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal area, which has a Mediterranean climate with mild winters and hot, dry summers, and the inland area, which has a more continental climate with colder winters and hotter summers. The dry season in Lazio typically runs from May to October, while the wet season runs from November to April. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Lazio, as the summer months can be very hot and crowded, while the winter months can be cold and rainy. However, the spring and autumn months offer a great balance of pleasant weather and smaller crowds, making them the best time to visit the region.

The summer months are the peak tourist season in Lazio, with many visitors flocking to the region's beaches and cities. However, this can also mean larger crowds and higher prices for accommodations and tourist attractions. On the other hand, the winter months can be a good time to visit Lazio if you're looking for a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices. Many of the region's museums and historical sites are less crowded during the winter months, and you can often find better deals on accommodations and tourist attractions.

The spring and autumn months are the best time to visit Lazio if you're looking for a balance of pleasant weather and smaller crowds. The temperatures are mild, ranging from 15°C to 25°C, and the region's landscapes are particularly beautiful during these months.
