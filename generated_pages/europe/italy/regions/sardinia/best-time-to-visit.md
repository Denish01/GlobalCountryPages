[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Sardinia, an autonomous region in Italy, has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The island can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal areas, which have a milder climate, and the mountainous interior, which is cooler and more prone to rain. The dry season, from June to September, is the best time to visit Sardinia's beaches and enjoy outdoor activities, while the wet season, from November to March, is better suited for exploring the island's interior and enjoying winter sports.

The seasons in Sardinia have a significant impact on travel, with the peak tourist season, from July to August, being the busiest and most expensive time to visit. During this period, the island's beaches and popular destinations are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are at their highest. In contrast, the shoulder season, from April to June and September to October, offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices, making it an ideal time to visit Sardinia for those who want to avoid the crowds and save money.

The winter months, from December to February, are the coolest and wettest time to visit Sardinia, with some tourist facilities, such as hotels and restaurants, closing down for the season. However, this period can be a good time to explore the island's interior, visit its museums and historical sites, and enjoy winter sports, such as skiing and hiking.
