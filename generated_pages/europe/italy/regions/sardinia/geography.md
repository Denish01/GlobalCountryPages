[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Sardinia is situated in the western part of the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 200 kilometers west of the Italian Peninsula. The island is separated from the Italian mainland by the Tyrrhenian Sea to the east and the Sardinian Sea to the west. To the north lies the French island of Corsica, while to the south is the Italian island of Sicily. Sardinia is also close to the African coast, with the Tunisian city of Carthage located about 290 kilometers to the south.

The island's strategic position in the Mediterranean has made it an important location for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The surrounding waters are rich in marine life, and the island's coastline is characterized by a mix of rugged cliffs, sandy beaches, and secluded coves. Sardinia's proximity to the Italian mainland and other Mediterranean islands has also made it a popular destination for tourists and travelers.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Sardinia's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, hills, and coastal plains. The island's interior is dominated by the **Gennargentu** mountain range, which runs along the eastern coast and includes the highest point, Punta La Marmora. The mountains are covered in dense forests, including oak, beech, and pine trees, and are home to a variety of wildlife, including deer, wild boar, and birds of prey.

The coastal areas are generally flat and fertile, with many beaches and coves along the coastline. The northwestern coast is characterized by rugged cliffs and rocky shores, while the southeastern coast is generally more sandy and gentle. Sardinia is also home to several rivers, including the **Tirso**, **Flumendosa**, and **Coghinas**, which flow through the island's interior and provide water for irrigation and other uses.

The island's landscape has been shaped by thousands of years of human activity, including agriculture, mining, and urbanization. Many of Sardinia's towns and cities are located on the coast, including the capital city of **Cagliari**, which is situated on the southern coast. The island's interior is more sparsely populated, with many small villages and rural communities.
