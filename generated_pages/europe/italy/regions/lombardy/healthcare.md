Lombardy's healthcare system is part of the Italian National Health Service (SSN), which provides universal coverage to all residents, including foreigners, who are registered with the system. The public healthcare system is funded through taxes and provides a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. Private healthcare providers also operate in Lombardy, offering additional services and specialized care. The quality of care in Lombardy is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, access to healthcare services can vary between urban and rural areas, with more specialized services available in larger cities like Milan.

The public healthcare system in Lombardy is divided into different levels of care, including primary care, specialized care, and hospital care. Primary care is provided by general practitioners, who serve as gatekeepers for the healthcare system, providing routine check-ups, vaccinations, and referrals to specialized care. Specialized care is provided by specialists, who work in hospitals or private clinics, and provide advanced diagnostic and treatment services. Hospital care is provided by public and private hospitals, which offer a wide range of services, including emergency care, surgery, and rehabilitation.

Overall, the healthcare system in Lombardy is well-organized and provides comprehensive coverage to its residents. However, as with any healthcare system, there are challenges and limitations, including waiting times for non-emergency services and limited access to specialized care in rural areas.
