[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Campania, a region in southern Italy, has a Mediterranean climate with warm summers and mild winters. The region can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal areas, which have a milder climate, and the mountainous interior, which has a cooler climate. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by low humidity and plenty of sunshine, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking and visiting the beach. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is characterized by higher humidity and more rainfall, but it's still a great time to visit the region's cities and cultural attractions.

The seasons in Campania can affect travel in various ways. During the peak season, which runs from June to August, the region can get very crowded, especially in popular destinations such as the Amalfi Coast and Pompeii. The high demand for accommodations and tourist services during this time can also drive up prices. On the other hand, the shoulder season, which runs from April to May and September to October, offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices, making it a great time to visit the region.

The winter months, which run from December to February, are generally cooler and wetter, but they can still be a great time to visit Campania, especially if you're interested in cultural attractions and indoor activities. The region's cities, such as Naples and Salerno, have a rich history and culture, and they offer a wide range of museums, galleries, and historical landmarks to explore.
