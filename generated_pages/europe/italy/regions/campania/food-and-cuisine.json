The region's culinary identity is deeply rooted in its history, with influences from the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Arabs, who introduced new ingredients and cooking techniques. Campania's cuisine is also characterized by its regional variations, with the coastal areas specializing in seafood dishes, while the inland regions focus on meat and vegetable-based recipes.\n\nThe region's capital, Naples, is particularly famous for its **cucina povera**, a style of cooking that originated among the city's working class and emphasizes simplicity, freshness, and affordability. This approach to cooking has resulted in the creation of many iconic dishes, such as **Pizza Margherita**, which was invented in Naples in the late 19th century. Campania's cuisine is also known for its rich desserts, including the famous **Babà**, a small, yeast-based cake soaked in rum syrup and filled with sweetened cream.\n\nCampania's food culture is deeply ingrained in the region's social fabric, with mealtimes often serving as opportunities for family and friends to gather and share stories. The region's cuisine is also closely tied to its festivals and celebrations, with many traditional dishes prepared specifically for holidays and special occasions. For example, the **Festa di San Gennaro** in Naples features a variety of traditional sweets and desserts, including the famous **Zeppole**, which are deep-fried dough balls dusted with powdered sugar.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Parmigiana di Melanzane | Main Course | Breaded and fried eggplant
