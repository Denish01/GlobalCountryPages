[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Campania is situated in the southern part of the Italian peninsula, occupying a strategic position in the Mediterranean region. The region is bordered by the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west, which provides a long coastline with several notable ports, including the Port of Naples. To the east, Campania is bordered by the Apennine Mountains, a rugged range that stretches across central and southern Italy. The region is also bounded by the Italian regions of Lazio to the north, Apulia to the east, and Basilicata to the southeast, as well as Molise to the northeast.

The geographical location of Campania has played a significant role in shaping the region's history, culture, and economy. The region's proximity to the sea has facilitated trade and cultural exchange with other Mediterranean countries, while the Apennine Mountains have provided a natural barrier against invasions and a source of natural resources. The region's borders have also been influenced by the numerous rivers that flow through it, including the Volturno, Calore, and Sarno rivers, which have carved out valleys and created fertile plains.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Campania is characterized by a mix of mountains, hills, and coastal plains. The Apennine Mountains, which form the eastern border of the region, are a dominant feature of the landscape. The mountains are rugged and steep, with peaks reaching elevations of over 1,800 meters. The highest point in Campania is Monte Cervati, which rises to an elevation of 1,900 meters. The mountains are also home to several national parks, including the Parco Nazionale del Cilento e Vallo di Diano, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In contrast to the mountains, the coastal plains of Campania are generally flat and fertile, with a mix of agricultural land, urban areas, and natural habitats. The region's coastline is approximately 350 kilometers long and features several notable bays, including the Bay of Naples and the Gulf of Salerno. The coastline is also dotted with numerous islands, including Capri, Ischia, and Procida, which are popular tourist destinations. The islands are known for their stunning natural beauty, with crystal-clear waters, white-sand beaches, and picturesque towns perched on hilltops.

The interior of Campania is also home to several notable lakes, including Lake Patria and Lake Matese, which are popular spots for fishing and boating. The region's rivers, including the Volturno and Calore, have carved out valleys and created fertile plains, which are used for agriculture and other economic activities. The region's terrain is also characterized by several active volcanoes, including Mount Vesuvius, which is located near the city of Naples and is famous for its historic eruptions.
