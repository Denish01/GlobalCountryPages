[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Campania is part of the Italian National Health Service (SSN), which provides universal coverage to all citizens and residents. The system is primarily publicly funded, with a small contribution from private health insurance. The quality of care in Campania is generally high, with well-equipped hospitals and specialized medical facilities. However, as with many public healthcare systems, there can be waiting times for non-emergency procedures. Urban areas, such as Naples, have better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where facilities may be more limited.

The public healthcare system in Campania is divided into different levels of care, with hospitals and clinics providing primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by general practitioners and pediatricians, while secondary care is provided by specialists in hospitals and clinics. Tertiary care is provided by highly specialized hospitals and research centers. The region also has a number of private healthcare facilities, which offer a range of services, including specialized treatments and luxury amenities.

Despite the overall high quality of care, there can be challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly for non-Italian speakers. Many healthcare professionals in Campania speak some English, but it is still a good idea to learn some basic Italian phrases to help navigate the system. Additionally, some medical facilities may have limited hours of operation or require appointments in advance, so it is a good idea to plan ahead and research local healthcare options before visiting or moving to the region.
