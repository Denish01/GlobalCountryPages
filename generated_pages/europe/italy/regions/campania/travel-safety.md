[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Campania, a region in southern Italy, is known for its rich history, stunning coastline, and vibrant culture. The region is generally considered safe for tourists, with low rates of violent crime. However, as with any popular tourist destination, petty crimes such as pickpocketing and scams can occur, particularly in crowded areas and tourist hotspots. Visitors should be mindful of their belongings, especially in busy cities like Naples, and be cautious when interacting with strangers.

Campania's safety record is also influenced by its geography, with the region being prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The famous Mount Vesuvius, located near Naples, is an active volcano that requires monitoring and caution. Additionally, the region's coastal areas can be affected by strong winds and rough seas, which may impact maritime activities. Despite these potential risks, Campania's authorities and emergency services are well-equipped to handle such situations, and tourists can feel relatively safe with proper precautions and awareness.
