The region is generally considered safe for tourists, with low rates of violent crime. However, as with any popular tourist destination, petty crimes such as pickpocketing and scams can occur, particularly in crowded areas and tourist hotspots. Visitors should be mindful of their belongings, especially in busy cities like Naples, and be cautious when interacting with strangers.\n\nCampania's safety record is also influenced by its geography, with the region being prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The famous Mount Vesuvius, located near Naples, is an active volcano that requires monitoring and caution.

Despite these potential risks, Campania's authorities and emergency services are well-equipped to handle such situations, and tourists can feel relatively safe with proper precautions and awareness.\n\n[SECTION] Safety By Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/Region | Safety Level | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Naples | Moderate | Be cautious in crowded areas, especially at night |\n| Amalfi Coast | High | Generally safe, but beware of steep roads and cliffs |\n| Pompeii | High | Well-patrolled tourist area, but watch for pickpocketing |\n| Sorrento | High | Popular tourist destination with low crime rates |\n| Salerno | Moderate | Be aware of petty crime and traffic congestion |\n| Mount Vesuvius | Moderate | Follow guided tours and respect volcano warning signs |\n| Caserta | Low | Less touristy area with higher crime rates, exercise caution |\n| Island of Capri | High | Upscale tourist destination with low crime rates |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Common Risks & Scams [/SECTION]\n- Be cautious of pickpocketing in crowded areas, such as train stations and tourist hotspots\n- Beware of scams involving fake goods or services, especially in markets and from street vendors\n- Be mindful of overcharging by taxi drivers or restaurants in tourist areas\n- Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and use credit cards or traveler's checks instead\n- Be wary of strangers approaching you with unsolicited offers or services\n- Keep an eye on your drinks and food in crowded areas to avoid tampering or theft\n- Be prepared for potential demonstrations or protests in larger cities like Naples\n\n[SECTION] Health & Medical [/SECTION]\n- **Vaccinations:** No specific vaccinations are required for travel to Campania, but it's recommended to be up-to-date on all routine vaccinations\n- **Water Safety:** Tap water is generally safe to drink, but bottled water is widely available and recommended for sensitive stomachs\n- **Medical Facilities:** Campania has well-equipped hospitals and medical facilities, especially in larger cities like Naples and Salerno, but medical care may be limited in rural areas\n- **Pharmacy Access:** Pharmacies are widely available and easily accessible, with many open late or 24 hours\n\n[SECTION] Practical Safety Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas or at night\n- Keep valuables secure and consider using a money belt or hotel safe\n- Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and use credit cards or traveler's checks instead\n- Keep your hotel room door locked and use the hotel safe for valuables\n- Be cautious when using ATMs or exchanging money, and avoid doing so in isolated areas\n- Follow local advice and warning signs, especially in areas prone to natural disasters\n- Stay informed about local conditions and events through your hotel or local tourism office\n\n[SECTION] For Solo & Women Travelers [/SECTION]\n- Be confident and aware of your surroundings, especially at night or in crowded areas\n- Avoid walking alone in isolated areas or at night, and consider using a reputable taxi service\n- Dress modestly and respectfully, especially when visiting churches or rural areas\n- Keep your hotel room number and personal details private, and be cautious when interacting with strangers",
