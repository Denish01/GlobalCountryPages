Private healthcare is also available, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality services, often with shorter waiting times than public facilities. The quality of care in Sicily is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have more advanced facilities and specialized services.

In general, the healthcare system in Sicily is well-organized, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and public health programs. The region has made significant progress in recent years in reducing waiting times and improving the quality of care, particularly in urban areas. However, there may still be some challenges in accessing healthcare services in rural areas, where facilities and medical professionals may be scarce.

The public healthcare system in Sicily is generally free or low-cost for citizens and residents, while private healthcare can be more expensive. Visitors to the region may need to pay out-of-pocket for medical services, unless they have travel insurance that covers medical expenses.
