        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Italy has a rich and complex history that spans over 3,000 years. The Italian peninsula was inhabited by various civilizations, including the <strong>Etruscans</strong>, <strong>Greeks</strong>, and <strong>Romans</strong>. The Roman Empire, which was founded in 753 BC, played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture. The empire expanded its territories through conquests and eventually became one of the largest and most powerful empires in the world. The Roman Empire was divided into two parts in 285 AD, with the Western Roman Empire eventually falling in 476 AD.</p>
        <p>The Middle Ages saw the rise of various city-states, including <strong>Venice</strong>, <strong>Florence</strong>, and <strong>Rome</strong>, which became major centers of trade, art, and culture. The <strong>Renaissance</strong>, which began in the 14th century, marked a significant turning point in Italian history, with the emergence of notable figures such as <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong>, <strong>Michelangelo</strong>, and <strong>Galileo Galilei</strong>. The country was unified in 1861, with <strong>Victor Emmanuel II</strong> becoming the first king of Italy. The 20th century saw Italy's involvement in both World War I and World War II, with the country eventually becoming a <strong>republic</strong> in 1946.</p>
        <p>Italy's history is also marked by its complex relationships with its neighboring countries. The country has shared borders with <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, <strong>Austria</strong>, <strong>Slovenia</strong>, <strong>San Marino</strong>, and <strong>Vatican City</strong>, and has had varying levels of cooperation and conflict with these nations over the years. The country's strategic location in the Mediterranean has also made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange. Italy's history has been shaped by its unique geography, with the <strong>Apennine Mountains</strong> running along the eastern coast and the <strong>Po Valley</strong> in the north.</p>
        <p>The country's modern history has been marked by significant economic and social changes. Italy became a founding member of the <strong>European Economic Community</strong> (EEC) in 1957 and has since played an active role in European integration. The country has also experienced significant economic growth, with a strong focus on <strong>industrialization</strong> and <strong>export-led growth</strong>. Today, Italy is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> with a population of over 59 million people, and is a major player in global affairs.</p>
