  "content": "In Italy, the cost of healthcare varies depending on the type of service, provider, and location, with an average health expenditure per capita of $3,398 per year, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 22.3% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $3,398\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 22.3%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 118\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nItaly has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system, known as the **National Health Service (SSN)**, provides universal coverage to all citizens and residents, with a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions, available at no cost or at a reduced cost. However, the quality of public healthcare services can vary depending on the region and hospital, with some areas experiencing shortages of medical staff and equipment. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality services, with shorter wait times and more modern facilities, but at a higher cost.\n\nFor foreigners, the healthcare system can be more complex, and it is recommended that they have some form of health insurance to cover the cost of private healthcare services. EU citizens can access the public healthcare system using their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), while non-EU citizens may need to purchase private health insurance to cover their medical expenses. It is also worth noting that some private hospitals and clinics may not accept public health insurance, so it is essential to check the terms of your insurance policy before seeking medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public healthcare system, variable costs |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Public healthcare system, variable costs |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public healthcare system, variable costs |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public healthcare system, variable costs |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public healthcare system, variable costs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Public hospital, variable costs |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Public hospital, variable costs |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Public hospital, variable costs |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | Public hospital, variable costs |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public hospital, variable costs |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | Public hospital, variable costs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, doctor visits, hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist consultations |\n| International / Expat | $300-$600 | Private healthcare services, doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist consultations, repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally cheaper in Italy than in other European countries, with prices starting from $5-$10 per prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as painkillers and antihistamines, are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices starting from $5-$10 per packet.\n- Pharmacies are generally open from 9 am to 1 pm and 4 pm to 7 pm, Monday to Saturday, with some pharmacies open 24 hours a day.\n- Prescription rules vary depending on the type of medication, with some medications requiring a doctor's prescription, while others are available over-the-counter.\n- Common medications, such as antibiotics and antihypertensives, are widely available at pharmacies, with prices starting from $10-$20 per prescription.\n- Some medications, such as painkillers and sedatives, may be subject to restrictions and require a special prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 118, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
