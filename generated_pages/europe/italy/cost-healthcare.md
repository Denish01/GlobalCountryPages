[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Italy has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system, known as the **National Health Service (SSN)**, provides universal coverage to all citizens and residents, with a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions, available at no cost or at a reduced cost. However, the quality of public healthcare services can vary depending on the region and hospital, with some areas experiencing shortages of medical staff and equipment. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality services, with shorter wait times and more modern facilities, but at a higher cost.

For foreigners, the healthcare system can be more complex, and it is recommended that they have some form of health insurance to cover the cost of private healthcare services. EU citizens can access the public healthcare system using their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), while non-EU citizens may need to purchase private health insurance to cover their medical expenses. It is also worth noting that some private hospitals and clinics may not accept public health insurance, so it is essential to check the terms of your insurance policy before seeking medical care.
