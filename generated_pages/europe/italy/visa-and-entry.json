Non-EU citizens, on the other hand, may need a visa to enter Italy, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit. Currently, citizens of over 60 countries can enter Italy without a visa for tourism or business stays of up to 90 days.\n\nItaly's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade while maintaining national security and immigration controls. The country has a well-developed visa system, with various types of visas available for different purposes, including tourism, business, study, and work.
