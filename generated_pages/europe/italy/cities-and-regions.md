[SECTION] How Italy Is Divided [/SECTION]
Italy is a sovereign nation divided into 20 regions, each with its own capital and administrative powers. These regions are further divided into provinces and communes, with a total of 80 provinces and 7900 communes. The 20 regions of Italy are: Abruzzo, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lazio, Liguria, Lombardy, Marche, Molise, Piedmont, Sardinia, Sicily, Tuscany, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Umbria, and Veneto. Each region has its own unique character, culture, and history, and is responsible for managing its own affairs, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

The administrative structure of Italy is designed to provide a high degree of autonomy to the regions, while also ensuring that the country as a whole is governed in a unified and cohesive manner. The central government, based in Rome, is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign policy, and national economic policy, while the regions have a significant degree of control over local affairs. This system has allowed Italy to maintain a strong sense of regional identity and diversity, while also promoting national unity and cooperation.
