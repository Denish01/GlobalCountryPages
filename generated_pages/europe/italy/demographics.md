[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Italy's population is one of the largest in the European Union, with a relatively slow growth rate due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit slowly, with a projected increase of 3% by 2030. Urbanization is a significant trend in Italy, with nearly 70% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in the northern regions. Migration patterns also play a crucial role in shaping Italy's demographics, with many immigrants arriving from Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. According to the latest estimates, approximately 10% of Italy's population is foreign-born, with the majority coming from Romania, Albania, and Morocco.

The population of Italy is also characterized by a significant regional disparity, with the northern regions being more densely populated and economically developed than the southern regions. This disparity has led to a phenomenon known as the "Mezzogiorno problem," where the southern regions struggle with higher unemployment rates, lower GDP per capita, and a general lack of economic development. To address this issue, the Italian government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting economic growth and development in the southern regions.

In addition to these regional disparities, Italy's population is also facing the challenge of an aging population, with a significant proportion of the population aged 65 and above. This demographic shift has significant implications for the country's pension system, healthcare, and social security. To mitigate these effects, the Italian government has introduced various measures, such as increasing the retirement age and encouraging immigration to supplement the workforce.
