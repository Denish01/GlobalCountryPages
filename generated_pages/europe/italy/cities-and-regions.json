These regions are further divided into provinces and communes, with a total of 80 provinces and 7900 communes. The 20 regions of Italy are: Abruzzo, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lazio, Liguria, Lombardy, Marche, Molise, Piedmont, Sardinia, Sicily, Tuscany, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Umbria, and Veneto. Each region has its own unique character, culture, and history, and is responsible for managing its own affairs, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure.\n\nThe administrative structure of Italy is designed to provide a high degree of autonomy to the regions, while also ensuring that the country as a whole is governed in a unified and cohesive manner. The central government, based in Rome, is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign policy, and national economic policy, while the regions have a significant degree of control over local affairs. This system has allowed Italy to maintain a strong sense of regional identity and diversity, while also promoting national unity and cooperation.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Rome** (2.8M)\nRole: capital, cultural center\nKnown For: ancient history, architecture, art, and cuisine\nBest For: history buffs, foodies, and culture lovers\n\n**Milan** (1.4M)\nRole: economic hub, fashion center\nKnown For: fashion, design, finance, and industry\nBest For: business travelers, fashion enthusiasts, and shoppers\n\n**Naples** (970k)\nRole: port city, cultural center\nKnown For: history, architecture, music, and cuisine\nBest For: history buffs, foodies, and music lovers\n\n**Turin** (890k)\nRole: industrial center, cultural hub\nKnown For: automotive industry, chocolate, and Baroque architecture\nBest For: car enthusiasts, foodies, and architecture buffs\n\n**Palermo** (670k)\nRole: regional capital, cultural center\nKnown For: history, architecture, cuisine, and beaches\nBest For: history buffs, foodies, and beachgoers\n\n**Genoa** (580k)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: maritime history, architecture, and cuisine\nBest For: history buffs, foodies, and sailors\n\n**Bologna** (390k)\nRole: university town, cultural center\nKnown For: history, architecture, cuisine, and education\nBest For: students, foodies, and culture lovers\n\n**Florence** (350k)\nRole: cultural center, tourist hub\nKnown For: art, architecture, history, and cuisine\nBest For: art lovers, history buffs, and tourists\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tuscany | rolling hills, charming villages | wine, art, architecture | Florence |\n| Lombardy | industrial, urban | fashion, design, finance | Milan |\n| Campania | coastal, vibrant | history, architecture, cuisine | Naples |\n| Veneto | coastal, historic | art, architecture, canals | Venice |\n| Piedmont | mountainous, scenic | wine, cuisine, outdoor activities | Turin |\n| Emilia-Romagna | flat, fertile | cuisine, cars, music | Bologna |\n| Sicily | island, diverse | history, architecture, beaches | Palermo |\n| Sardinia | island, rugged | beaches, outdoor activities, cuisine | Cagliari |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The north of Italy is generally more industrialized and urbanized, with a strong focus on finance, fashion, and design, while the south is more rural and traditional, with a strong emphasis on agriculture and tourism.\n- The climate in Italy varies greatly from region to region, with the north being generally cooler and more temperate, while the south is warmer and more Mediterranean.\n- The culture and cuisine of Italy also vary greatly from region to region, with each region having its own unique traditions, customs, and specialties.\n- The language spoken in Italy is primarily Italian, but there are also many regional dialects and languages, such as Sicilian, Venetian, and Lombard.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nItaly has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and driving options available.
