[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nGermany has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa, while others require a visa in advance or can obtain one upon arrival. Germany is a member of the Schengen Area, which means that visitors can travel to other Schengen countries without additional visas. Citizens of around 62 countries can enter Germany visa-free, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and many European countries. These visa-free travelers can stay in Germany for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.\n\nGermany's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade while ensuring the security and integrity of its borders. The country has a well-organized system for handling visa applications, and the processing times are generally reasonable. However, it's essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it's always best to check with the German embassy or consulate for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | Unlimited | Can live and work in Germany with a valid ID card or passport |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter with a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30-90 days | Must apply in advance at a German embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30-90 days | Must apply in advance at a German embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Germany visa-free if they are citizens of eligible countries.
