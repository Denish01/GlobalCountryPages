[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Lower Saxony, a region in northwest Germany, has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. The region's climate is influenced by its proximity to the North Sea, with mild winters and cool summers. The best time to visit Lower Saxony is during the spring and summer months, when the weather is mild and pleasant, with average high temperatures ranging from 18°C to 22°C (64°F to 72°F). The winter months, from December to February, are the coldest and wettest, with average low temperatures ranging from 0°C to 2°C (32°F to 36°F). The autumn season, from September to November, is generally mild, with average high temperatures ranging from 10°C to 15°C (50°F to 59°F).

The region's climate can be divided into two main zones: the coastal region, which has a milder climate due to the influence of the North Sea, and the inland region, which has a more continental climate. The coastal region is ideal for visiting during the summer months, when the weather is warm and sunny, while the inland region is better suited for visiting during the spring and autumn months, when the weather is mild and pleasant.

The seasons in Lower Saxony can affect travel in various ways. During the peak season, from June to August, the region's tourist attractions and popular destinations can be crowded, and prices for accommodation and tourist services may be higher. However, the summer months offer a wide range of outdoor activities, such as hiking, cycling, and water sports, making it an ideal time to visit for nature lovers and adventure seekers. During the off-season, from November to March, some tourist attractions and facilities may be closed, and the weather can be cold and wet, but prices for accommodation and tourist services may be lower.
