The quality of care in Berlin is excellent, with well-trained medical professionals, modern equipment, and a wide range of medical specialties available. In urban areas like Berlin, access to healthcare is generally good, with many hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies available. However, in rural areas, access to specialized care may be limited, and patients may need to travel to larger cities for certain treatments.
