[SECTION] How Berlin Is Divided [/SECTION]
Berlin is a city-state, meaning it serves as both a city and a state, with its own government and administrative structure. The city is divided into 12 boroughs, each with its own local government and responsibilities. This division allows for more localized decision-making and a stronger sense of community within each borough. The boroughs are further divided into smaller neighborhoods, each with its own unique character and charm.

The city's administrative structure is designed to promote efficiency and accountability, with a strong emphasis on citizen participation and engagement. The Berlin Senate, composed of the Mayor and several Senators, is responsible for overseeing the city's overall development and making key decisions on policy and budget. The boroughs, in turn, have a significant degree of autonomy, allowing them to respond to local needs and priorities.
