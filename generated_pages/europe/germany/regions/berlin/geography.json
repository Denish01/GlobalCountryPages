The city is situated in the northeastern part of Germany, about 70 kilometers west of the Polish border. Berlin is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, which is one of the 16 states of Germany. The city is also close to several major rivers, including the Spree, Havel, and Dahme, which have played an important role in the city's history and development.\n\nBerlin's location in the heart of Europe has made it an important center for trade, culture, and politics. The city is situated at the intersection of several major transportation routes, including the Berlin-Warsaw rail line and the Berlin-Munich autobahn. This has made Berlin a hub for international travel and commerce, with two major airports, Berlin Tegel and Berlin Schönefeld, serving the city. Berlin is also a major cultural center, with numerous museums, theaters, and concert halls, and is home to a diverse population of over 6 million people.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nBerlin's terrain is generally flat, with an average elevation of about 50 meters above sea level. The city is situated in a glacial valley, which was formed during the last ice age. The valley is surrounded by a series of low-lying hills, including the Müggelberge, which is the highest point in Berlin. The city's terrain has been shaped by the rivers that flow through it, including the Spree, Havel, and Dahme, which have created a series of lakes, canals, and wetlands.\n\nOne of Berlin's most distinctive features is its many parks and gardens, which cover over 20% of the city's area. The Tiergarten, a large park in the heart of the city, is one of the most famous and popular parks in Berlin. The city is also home to several large forests, including the Grunewald and the Spandauer Forst, which offer opportunities for hiking, cycling, and other outdoor activities. Berlin's terrain has also been shaped by its history, with many of the city's buildings and landmarks reflecting its complex and often turbulent past.\n\nThe city's landscape is also characterized by its many waterways, including the Spree River, which runs through the heart of the city. The river has played a major role in Berlin's history, with many of the city's landmarks, including the Berlin Cathedral and the Museum Island, located along its banks. The city's canals and lakes are also popular for boating and other water sports, and offer a unique perspective on the city's landscape and architecture.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 10-20°C | 40-60 mm | mild, sunny |\n| Summer | June to August | 20-30°C | 60-80 mm | warm, humid |\n| Autumn | September to November | 10-20°C | 40-60 mm | cool, rainy |\n| Winter | December to February | 0-10°C | 20-40 mm | cold, snowy |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to November and March to May.
