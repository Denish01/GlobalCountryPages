[/SECTION]\nGermany is considered a moderate to expensive country to live in or visit, with prices comparable to other Western European nations. The cost of living in Germany is slightly higher than in some of its Eastern European neighbors, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, but lower than in countries like Switzerland and Denmark. Overall, Germany offers a good balance between quality of life and affordability, making it a popular destination for tourists and expats alike.\n\nCompared to global averages, Germany's prices are above the midpoint, with significant costs for accommodation, food, and transportation. However, the country's strong economy and high standard of living contribute to a relatively high cost of living.
