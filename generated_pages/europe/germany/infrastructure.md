[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Germany's infrastructure is highly developed, with significant investments in recent years to improve and expand its transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications. The country's urban areas, such as Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg, have excellent infrastructure, with modern public transportation systems, reliable energy supply, and high-speed internet access. However, there is a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with some rural regions still lacking access to high-speed internet and modern transportation infrastructure. The German government has been working to address this gap, with initiatives such as the **Digital Agenda 2025** and the **Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030**.

Germany's infrastructure development is driven by a strong economy and a highly skilled workforce, with a focus on innovation and sustainability. The country is a leader in **renewable energy**, with a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. The government has also launched several initiatives to promote **electric mobility**, with a target of having 10 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030.

The country's infrastructure is also supported by a well-developed **public-private partnership** (PPP) model, which allows for private sector investment in infrastructure projects. This has enabled the government to leverage private sector expertise and funding to deliver large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the **Stuttgart 21** rail project and the **A7 highway** expansion.
