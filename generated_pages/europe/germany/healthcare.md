[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Germany's healthcare system is a universal, multi-payer system that provides comprehensive coverage to its citizens. The system is divided into two main parts: **statutory health insurance** (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung, or GKV) and **private health insurance** (Private Krankenversicherung, or PKV). The statutory health insurance system is the primary source of healthcare coverage for most Germans, with over 90% of the population enrolled. The system is funded through premiums, which are split between employees and employers. The quality of care in Germany is excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and state-of-the-art facilities. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services, with a higher concentration of hospitals and specialists, while rural areas may have more limited access.

The German healthcare system is also known for its emphasis on **preventive care**, with regular check-ups and screenings encouraged for all citizens. This approach has contributed to Germany's high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates. Additionally, Germany has a strong network of **community health services**, including health centers, nursing homes, and home care services, which provide support to patients with chronic conditions and those in need of ongoing care.

Germany's healthcare system is also characterized by a high degree of **patient autonomy**, with patients having the right to choose their own doctors and hospitals. This has led to a competitive market, with hospitals and healthcare providers competing to offer high-quality services and attract patients. Overall, Germany's healthcare system is considered one of the best in the world, with a strong focus on preventive care, patient autonomy, and high-quality medical services.
