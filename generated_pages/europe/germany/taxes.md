[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Germany has a **worldwide taxation** system, meaning that residents are taxed on their global income, regardless of where it is earned. However, non-residents are only taxed on their German-sourced income. To be considered a tax resident in Germany, an individual must have a **permanent home** or **habitual abode** in the country. The tax authorities consider various factors, including the individual's domicile, family ties, and economic interests, to determine tax residency. Generally, if an individual spends more than 183 days in Germany within a calendar year, they will be considered a tax resident.

The German tax system is complex, with multiple types of taxes, including income tax, corporate tax, and value-added tax (VAT). The tax system is administered by the **Federal Central Tax Office** (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern), which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing guidance to taxpayers. Taxpayers can also seek assistance from **tax consultants** (Steuerberater) or **tax lawyers** (Steueranwälte) to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.
