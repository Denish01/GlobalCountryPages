  "content": "The population of Germany is a diverse and dynamic group, with approximately 84.5 million people living in the country, representing a unique blend of indigenous and immigrant communities. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 84.5 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.5%\nMedian Age: 46 years\nUrban Population: 77%\nPopulation Density: 236 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 81 years\nFertility Rate: 1.4 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nGermany's population is one of the largest in the European Union, with a relatively slow growth rate due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. The country's population has been steadily increasing over the years, with a significant influx of immigrants from other European countries and beyond. Urbanization is a dominant trend in Germany, with the majority of the population residing in cities and metropolitan areas. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow pace, with estimates suggesting that it will reach 85 million by 2030. Germany's population growth is also influenced by migration patterns, with the country being a popular destination for migrants from other European countries, as well as from countries outside of Europe.\n\nThe population of Germany is also characterized by a high level of education and a strong economy, with a highly developed social security system and a high standard of living. The country's population is also known for its cultural diversity, with a rich history and a vibrant cultural scene. Germany's population is also aging, with a high proportion of older people, which poses challenges for the country's pension system and healthcare services. To address these challenges, the German government has implemented various policies, such as increasing the retirement age and encouraging immigration to supplement the workforce.\n\nGermany's population growth is also influenced by regional differences, with some states experiencing faster growth than others. The states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, for example, have experienced significant population growth in recent years, driven by their strong economies and high standard of living. In contrast, some states in eastern Germany have experienced population decline, due to a combination of factors including low fertility rates and migration to other parts of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| German | 80% | Nationwide | Indigenous population |\n| Turkish | 5% | Urban areas | Largest immigrant group |\n| Polish | 2% | Eastern regions | Significant minority |\n| Russian | 1.5% | Eastern regions | Immigrant community |\n| Kurdish | 1% | Urban areas | Refugee community |\n| Italian | 0.5% | Southern regions | Immigrant community |\n| Greek | 0.5% | Urban areas | Immigrant community |\n[/TABLE]\nGermany is a multicultural society, with a diverse range of ethnic groups living in the country.
