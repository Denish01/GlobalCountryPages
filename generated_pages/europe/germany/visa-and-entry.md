Citizens of around 62 countries can enter Germany visa-free, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and many European countries. These visa-free travelers can stay in Germany for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.

The country has a well-organized system for handling visa applications, and the processing times are generally reasonable.
