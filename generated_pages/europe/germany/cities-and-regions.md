[SECTION] How Germany Is Divided [/SECTION]
Germany is divided into 16 states, also known as Bundesländer, which are further divided into districts and municipalities. This federal structure gives each state a significant amount of autonomy, allowing them to make decisions on matters such as education, culture, and environmental policy. The states are also represented in the German parliament, the Bundestag, where they have a say in national policy-making.

The 16 states are a mix of larger and smaller regions, each with their own unique character and identity. Some states, such as North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, are major economic hubs, while others, such as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Schleswig-Holstein, are known for their natural beauty and tourism industries. This diversity of regions and states is a key part of what makes Germany such a fascinating and dynamic country to visit or live in.
