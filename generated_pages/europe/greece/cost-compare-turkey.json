Greece, a member of the European Union, has a more developed economy with a higher GDP per capita. However, the country has faced economic challenges in recent years, including high debt and unemployment. Turkey, on the other hand, has a larger and more diverse economy, with a strong focus on industry and trade. Despite these differences, both countries offer a unique cultural and historical experience for visitors and expats. In terms of cost of living, Greece tends to be more expensive than Turkey, particularly when it comes to housing, food, and transportation.\n\nThe cost difference between the two countries is significant, with Turkey offering a more affordable lifestyle for those looking to relocate. Rent, in particular, is a major factor in the overall cost of living, with prices in Greece often 30-50% higher than in Turkey. Food and dining costs also vary, with traditional Turkish cuisine often cheaper than its Greek counterpart. However, it's worth noting that prices can fluctuate depending on the location, with major cities like Athens and Istanbul tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Greece (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 250 | 44% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 300 | 180 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 450 | 43% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Greece (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 500 | 350 | 30% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 40% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Greece (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 20 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.50 | 1.00 | 33% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.00 | 17% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Greece (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 25 | 20 | 20% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Greece (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 800 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,000 | 1,400 | 30% |\n| Comfortable | 3,000 | 2,200 | 27% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Greece is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and luxury goods\n- Island vacations and beach resorts\n- Historical and cultural attractions\n- **Turkey is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation and rent\n- Food and dining, particularly traditional cuisine\n- Transportation and fuel\n- Utilities and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Turkey offers a more affordable lifestyle, with significant savings on rent, food, and transportation.
