        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Greece, officially known as the Hellenic Republic, has a rich and complex history that spans over 4,000 years. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa has made it a significant cultural and trade hub throughout the centuries. The <strong>Minoan Civilization</strong>, which flourished on the island of Crete from around 2600 to 1100 BCE, is considered one of the earliest civilizations in Europe. The <strong>Mycenaean Civilization</strong>, which emerged on the Greek mainland around 1600 BCE, is known for its impressive palaces and trade networks.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Classical Period</strong>, which lasted from around 500 to 323 BCE, is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Greece. During this time, the city-states of Athens and Sparta dominated the region, and famous philosophers such as <strong>Socrates</strong>, <strong>Plato</strong>, and <strong>Aristotle</strong> made significant contributions to Western philosophy. The <strong>Hellenistic Period</strong>, which followed the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, saw the rise of powerful kingdoms and the spread of Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean.</p>
        <p>Greece gained its independence from the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> on March 25, 1821, after a long and bloody struggle. The country became a <strong>monarchy</strong> in 1832, with King Otto of Bavaria as its first ruler. In 1924, Greece became a <strong>republic</strong>, and in 1981, it joined the <strong>European Economic Community</strong>, a precursor to the European Union. Today, Greece is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> and a member of the European Union, the United Nations, and other international organizations.</p>
        <p>The country's complex history has had a lasting impact on its culture, politics, and economy. The <strong>Greek War of Independence</strong>, which lasted from 1821 to 1832, was a significant turning point in the country's history, and it paved the way for Greece's emergence as a modern nation-state. The <strong>Greek Civil War</strong>, which took place from 1946 to 1949, was a brutal conflict that had a profound impact on the country's politics and society.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
