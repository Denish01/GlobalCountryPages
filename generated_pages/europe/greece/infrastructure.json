  "content": "Greece's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications, although there are still significant disparities between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 73%\nRoad Network: 117,000 km, with a mix of high-quality highways and rural roads\nRail Network: 2,571 km\nMajor Airports: 15\nMajor Ports: 16\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nGreece's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with a focus on upgrading its transportation networks, increasing energy efficiency, and improving access to basic services such as water and sanitation. The country has invested heavily in its road network, with the construction of new highways and the upgrade of existing roads. However, there are still significant disparities between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as broadband internet and reliable public transportation. Recent investments in renewable energy and telecommunications have also helped to drive economic growth and improve the overall quality of life for Greeks.\n\nThe urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge for Greece, with many rural areas struggling to access basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives aimed at addressing this disparity, including the development of new transportation networks and the upgrade of existing infrastructure in rural areas. Despite these efforts, however, there is still much work to be done to ensure that all Greeks have access to the same level of infrastructure and services.\n\nGreece's infrastructure development has also been driven by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The country's ports and airports play a critical role in international trade and commerce, with many major shipping lines and airlines operating in the country. This has helped to drive investment in the country's transportation infrastructure, with a focus on upgrading its ports and airports to meet the needs of international trade and commerce.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 117,000 km | Good | High-quality highways connect major cities, while rural roads can be poor |\n| Railways | 2,571 km | Moderate | Network is relatively underdeveloped, with limited services to rural areas |\n| Airports | 15 international, 25 domestic | Good | Major airports such as Athens and Thessaloniki offer high-quality facilities and services |\n| Ports | 16 major | Good | Ports such as Piraeus and Thessaloniki are major hubs for international trade and commerce |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Greece's power generation is dominated by **lignite**, with a significant portion of its electricity coming from coal-fired power plants.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing its use of **renewable energy**, with a focus on wind and solar power.\n- Greece's energy infrastructure is relatively reliable, with few **power outages** reported in recent years.\n- The country has set ambitious targets for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and increasing its use of renewable energy.\n- Greece is also a major transit country for **natural gas**, with several major pipelines passing through its territory.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is safe to drink in most areas of Greece, although there may be some concerns in rural areas.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is high, with over 95% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** can be a challenge in some rural areas, particularly during periods of drought.\n- Greece has made significant progress in reducing its **water pollution**, with a focus on improving wastewater treatment and reducing agricultural runoff.\n- The country has also launched several initiatives aimed at promoting **water conservation** and reducing water waste.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with over 95% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber broadband** is available in many areas, although **rural broadband** can be limited.\n- Greece has launched several initiatives aimed at promoting the **rollout of 4G and 5G services**, with a focus on improving mobile coverage and increasing internet speeds.\n- The country has also made significant progress in developing its **postal services**, with a focus on improving delivery times and increasing access to postal services in rural areas.\n- **Internet penetration** is relatively high, with over 70% of the population having access to the internet.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- Greece has launched several major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of a new **high-speed rail line** connecting Athens and Thessaloniki.\n- The country is also investing heavily in its **ports and airports**, with a focus on upgrading its transportation infrastructure to meet the needs of international trade and commerce.\n- Greece has set ambitious targets for increasing its use of **renewable energy**, with a focus on wind and solar power.\n- The country is also investing in its **water infrastructure**, with a focus on improving wastewater treatment and reducing water pollution.\n- Greece has received significant funding from the **European Union** to support its infrastructure development projects, with a focus on promoting economic growth and improving the overall quality of life for Greeks.",
