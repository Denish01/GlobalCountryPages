The **head of state**, the President of the Hellenic Republic, serves as a largely ceremonial figure, while the **head of government**, the Prime Minister of Greece, is responsible for overseeing the administration of the country. The government is unitary, with a centralized authority in Athens. The **Hellenic Parliament**, a unicameral legislature, is composed of 300 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term.\n\nThe Greek **constitution**, which was adopted in 1975 and has undergone several amendments, establishes the framework for the country's government and guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms to its citizens. The government is accountable to the parliament, which has the power to approve or reject legislation and to exercise oversight over the administration. The **judicial system** is independent and impartial, with the **Supreme Court** serving as the highest court in the land.\n\nThe Greek **political system** is characterized by a multi-party landscape, with several major parties competing for power and influence.

This system has led to a fragmentation of the party system, with several small parties represented in parliament.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Government of Greece | Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis | Oversees administration of the country |\n| Legislative | Hellenic Parliament | Speaker Konstantinos Tasoulas | Makes laws and exercises oversight over the administration |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Interprets laws and ensures their consistency with the constitution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New Democracy | Center-right | Kyriakos Mitsotakis | 158 | Major party, currently in power |\n| Syriza | Left-wing | Alexis Tsipras | 86 | Major party, previously in power |\n| PASOK | Center-left | Nikos Androulakis | 22 | Historic party, currently in opposition |\n| KKE | Communist | Dimitris Koutsoumbas | 15 | Radical left party, in opposition |\n| Greek Solution | Right-wing | Kyriakos Velopoulos | 10 | Nationalist party, in opposition |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The **electoral system** in Greece is based on proportional representation, with voters casting ballots for party lists rather than individual candidates.\n- **Parliamentary elections** are held every four years, unless the government loses a confidence vote or the parliament is dissolved.\n- The **last parliamentary election** was held in 2023, with New Democracy emerging as the winner.\n- **Voter participation** is generally high in Greece, with turnout rates often exceeding 60%.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current **political climate** in Greece is characterized by a sense of stability, with the New Democracy government enjoying a majority in parliament.\n- **Key issues** facing the government include managing the country's **debt crisis**, promoting **economic growth**, and addressing the **migration crisis**.\n- **Regional dynamics** play an important role in Greek politics, with the country's relationships with its neighbors, particularly **Turkey**, being a major concern.\n- Greece is ranked 27th globally in terms of **press freedom**, according to the 2021 World Press Freedom Index.\n- The country is also ranked 24th globally in terms of **human development**, according to the 2021 Human Development Index.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Greece is a **member of the European Union** and the **United Nations**, and participates in various international organizations, such as the **NATO** and the **OSCE**.\n- The country has a **strategic partnership** with the **United States**, and maintains close relationships with other European countries, particularly **Germany** and **France**.\n- Greece has a **disputed border** with **Turkey**, with which it has had a complex and often tense relationship over the years.\n- The country is also a **key player** in regional organizations, such as the **Balkan Cooperation** and the **Black Sea Economic Cooperation**.\n- Greece has **diplomatic relations** with over 180 countries around the world, and maintains a network of **embassies** and **consulates** to promote its interests abroad.",
