[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Greece's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with a focus on upgrading its transportation networks, increasing energy efficiency, and improving access to basic services such as water and sanitation. The country has invested heavily in its road network, with the construction of new highways and the upgrade of existing roads. However, there are still significant disparities between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as broadband internet and reliable public transportation. Recent investments in renewable energy and telecommunications have also helped to drive economic growth and improve the overall quality of life for Greeks.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge for Greece, with many rural areas struggling to access basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives aimed at addressing this disparity, including the development of new transportation networks and the upgrade of existing infrastructure in rural areas. Despite these efforts, however, there is still much work to be done to ensure that all Greeks have access to the same level of infrastructure and services.

Greece's infrastructure development has also been driven by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The country's ports and airports play a critical role in international trade and commerce, with many major shipping lines and airlines operating in the country. This has helped to drive investment in the country's transportation infrastructure, with a focus on upgrading its ports and airports to meet the needs of international trade and commerce.
