[SECTION] How Greece Is Divided [/SECTION]
Greece is divided into 13 regions, each with its own administrative and economic powers. These regions are further divided into 54 regional units, which are then divided into municipalities. The 13 regions of Greece are: Attica, Central Greece, Central Macedonia, Crete, East Macedonia and Thrace, Epirus, Ionian Islands, North Aegean, Peloponnese, South Aegean, Thessaly, and West Greece. The autonomous region of Mount Athos is a self-governing entity that is home to several monasteries and is not part of any region.

The administrative structure of Greece is designed to promote regional development and decentralization. Each region has its own regional council, which is responsible for implementing regional policies and managing regional funds. The regional units, on the other hand, are responsible for providing local services such as healthcare, education, and transportation. This system allows for a more effective distribution of resources and a greater level of autonomy for local authorities.
