The public healthcare system is funded through taxes and social security contributions, and it provides a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. However, the public system can be overwhelmed, especially in rural areas, where resources and personnel may be limited. Private healthcare is also widely available, with many high-quality hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas like Athens. The quality of care in Greece is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the public system can be bureaucratic, and wait times for certain procedures can be long.\n\nIn urban areas, access to healthcare is generally good, with many public and private hospitals and clinics available. However, in rural areas, access to healthcare can be more limited, with fewer resources and personnel available. Despite these challenges, Greece has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on increasing access to care, especially for vulnerable populations.\n\nThe Greek government has also implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system, including the introduction of a new electronic health record system and the expansion of telemedicine services. These reforms have helped to improve the quality of care and increase access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Evangelismos General Hospital | Athens | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Athens Medical Center | Athens | Private | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Yes |\n| Hygeia Hospital | Athens | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Thessaloniki General Hospital | Thessaloniki | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Metropolitan Hospital | Athens | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Iaso General Hospital | Athens | Private | General medicine, surgery, gynecology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expats, as it can provide access to better facilities and shorter wait times.\n- **Local health insurance options** are available, including the Greek National Health System, which provides coverage for citizens and certain categories of non-citizens.\n- **Expats** may be eligible for coverage under the Greek National Health System, depending on their employment status and other factors.\n- **Costs** for health insurance can vary widely, depending on the provider, the level of coverage, and the individual's age and health status.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors, as it can provide coverage for unexpected medical expenses and other emergencies.\n- **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)** is accepted in Greece, which provides coverage for emergency medical care for EU citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Greece, including both prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many common medications are available without a prescription.\n- **Common brands** of medications are widely available, including international brands and generic versions.\n- **Costs** for medications can vary, depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies located throughout the country, especially in urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Greece include hepatitis A and typhoid fever, depending on the individual's health status and travel plans.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis B, rabies, and influenza.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Greece include mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus and tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Greece, but visitors should take precautions to avoid waterborne illnesses.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, but visitors should take precautions to avoid foodborne illnesses.\n- **Sun protection** is important in Greece, especially during the summer months, due to the strong sun and high temperatures.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Greece include cosmetic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and fertility treatments.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Greece include the Athens Medical Center and the Hygeia Hospital.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists, depending on the procedure and the hospital.\n- **English-speaking staff** are widely available in Greek hospitals and clinics, making it easier for international patients to communicate and receive care.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** in Greece is 166, which provides access to emergency medical services.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, but visitors should take precautions to avoid accidents and emergencies.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by contacting the emergency number or by asking locals for directions.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted as soon as possible after an emergency, to ensure coverage and reimbursement.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, especially for serious injuries or illnesses, and visitors should have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuation.",
