# The Truth About Greece - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Greece, officially known as the Hellenic Republic, has a rich and complex history that spans over 4,000 years. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa has made it a significant cultural and trade hub throughout the centuries. The **Minoan Civilization**, which flourished on the island of Crete from around 2600 to 1100 BCE, is considered one of the earliest civilizations in Europe. The **Mycenaean Civilization**, which emerged on the Greek mainland around 1600 BCE, is known for its impressive palaces and trade networks.

The **Classical Period**, which lasted from around 500 to 323 BCE, is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Greece. During this time, the city-states of Athens and Sparta dominated the region, and famous philosophers such as **Socrates**, **Plato**, and **Aristotle** made significant contributions to Western philosophy. The **Hellenistic Period**, which followed the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, saw the rise of powerful kingdoms and the spread of Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean.

Greece gained its independence from the **Ottoman Empire** on March 25, 1821, after a long and bloody struggle. The country became a **monarchy** in 1832, with King Otto of Bavaria as its first ruler. In 1924, Greece became a **republic**, and in 1981, it joined the **European Economic Community**, a precursor to the European Union. Today, Greece is a **sovereign state** and a member of the European Union, the United Nations, and other international organizations.

The country's complex history has had a lasting impact on its culture, politics, and economy. The **Greek War of Independence**, which lasted from 1821 to 1832, was a significant turning point in the country's history, and it paved the way for Greece's emergence as a modern nation-state. The **Greek Civil War**, which took place from 1946 to 1949, was a brutal conflict that had a profound impact on the country's politics and society.
