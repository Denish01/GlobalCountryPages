  "content": "Greece is generally cheaper than Italy, with an overall cost of living that is around 10-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGreece GDP per Capita (PPP): 29,090\nItaly GDP per Capita (PPP): 43,640\nGreece Inflation Rate: 1.2%\nItaly Inflation Rate: 1.1%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Greece\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Greece vs Italy [/SECTION]\nGreece and Italy are two popular European countries known for their rich history, culture, and natural beauty. However, when it comes to the cost of living, there are some significant differences between the two countries. Greece has a lower cost of living compared to Italy, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being generally lower. This is partly due to the economic context of the two countries, with Greece having faced significant economic challenges in recent years, including a debt crisis and austerity measures. As a result, prices for many goods and services have remained relatively low.\n\nThe cost of living in Greece is around 10-20% lower than in Italy, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees on a budget. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Athens and Thessaloniki tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. In Italy, the cost of living is higher, particularly in cities like Rome, Florence, and Venice, which are popular tourist destinations. However, Italy also has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which can make it a more attractive option for some people.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Greece (USD) | Italy (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 400 | 37% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 700 | 1,200 | 42% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Greece (USD) | Italy (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 20 | 25% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 400 | 25% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 5 | 40% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Greece (USD) | Italy (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 40 | 25% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.20 | 1.50 | 20% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Greece (USD) | Italy (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Greece (USD) | Italy (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Greece is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in Italy\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries costing around 25-40% less\n- Transportation, with monthly transit passes and taxi fares up to 50% cheaper\n- Utilities and internet, with bills up to 33% lower\n- **Italy is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and luxury goods, with prices often lower than in Greece\n- International flights, with more frequent and affordable connections to other European cities\n- Cultural events and festivals, with a wider range of options and often lower ticket prices\n- Skiing and winter sports, with more developed resorts and infrastructure in the Italian Alps\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees on a budget, Greece offers a more affordable cost of living and a lower overall cost of living.
