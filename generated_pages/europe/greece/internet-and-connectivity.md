[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Greece is generally of good quality, with average download speeds of 24 Mbps, allowing for smooth browsing, streaming, and online communication. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in major cities like Athens and Thessaloniki, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall reliability of the internet in Greece is relatively high, with most users experiencing minimal downtime and few issues with connectivity.

Greece has made significant investments in its telecommunications infrastructure in recent years, resulting in improved internet speeds and coverage across the country. This has enabled the widespread adoption of online services, including e-government, e-commerce, and streaming platforms, making it easier for tourists and locals alike to access the information and services they need. Additionally, the Greek government has implemented initiatives to expand broadband coverage to rural areas, aiming to bridge the digital divide and promote economic development in these regions.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Greece, you can visit a store of one of the main carriers, such as Cosmote, Vodafone, or Wind, and provide a valid passport and proof of address. You can also purchase a tourist SIM card at airports, ports, and other tourist destinations, which usually come with a set amount of data and minutes. Recommended carriers for tourists include Cosmote and Vodafone, which offer a range of data plans and competitive pricing. It's also possible to buy a SIM card from smaller, prepaid carriers like QTelecom or F2G, which may offer more affordable options for short-term use.

When purchasing a SIM card, you'll typically need to provide your passport and proof of address, and you may be required to register your SIM card with the carrier. This process usually takes a few minutes, and you'll receive a new SIM card with a Greek phone number. You can then top up your account with credit or purchase a data plan, which can be done online or at a carrier store.
