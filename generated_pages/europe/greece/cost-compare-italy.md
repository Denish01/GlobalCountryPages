[SECTION] Overview: Greece vs Italy [/SECTION]
Greece and Italy are two popular European countries known for their rich history, culture, and natural beauty. However, when it comes to the cost of living, there are some significant differences between the two countries. Greece has a lower cost of living compared to Italy, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being generally lower. This is partly due to the economic context of the two countries, with Greece having faced significant economic challenges in recent years, including a debt crisis and austerity measures. As a result, prices for many goods and services have remained relatively low.

The cost of living in Greece is around 10-20% lower than in Italy, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees on a budget. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Athens and Thessaloniki tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. In Italy, the cost of living is higher, particularly in cities like Rome, Florence, and Venice, which are popular tourist destinations. However, Italy also has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which can make it a more attractive option for some people.
