[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Greek government is based on the principle of **separation of powers**, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches operating independently. The **head of state**, the President of the Hellenic Republic, serves as a largely ceremonial figure, while the **head of government**, the Prime Minister of Greece, is responsible for overseeing the administration of the country. The government is unitary, with a centralized authority in Athens. The **Hellenic Parliament**, a unicameral legislature, is composed of 300 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term.

The Greek **constitution**, which was adopted in 1975 and has undergone several amendments, establishes the framework for the country's government and guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms to its citizens. The government is accountable to the parliament, which has the power to approve or reject legislation and to exercise oversight over the administration. The **judicial system** is independent and impartial, with the **Supreme Court** serving as the highest court in the land.

The Greek **political system** is characterized by a multi-party landscape, with several major parties competing for power and influence. The **electoral system** is based on proportional representation, with voters casting ballots for party lists rather than individual candidates. This system has led to a fragmentation of the party system, with several small parties represented in parliament.
