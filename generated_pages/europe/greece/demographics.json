  "content": "Greece is home to a diverse population of approximately 10.4 million people, with a mix of urban and rural dwellers, and a variety of ethnic and linguistic groups.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 10.4 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.3%\nMedian Age: 44.5 years\nUrban Population: 78%\nPopulation Density: 79 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 80.7 years\nFertility Rate: 1.4 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nGreece has a relatively small population compared to other European countries, with a total of approximately 10.4 million people. The population has been growing at a slow rate of 0.3% per annum, primarily due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. The majority of the population, around 78%, resides in urban areas, with the largest cities being Athens and Thessaloniki. Greece has a long history of migration, with many Greeks emigrating to other countries, particularly during the economic crisis of the 2000s. However, in recent years, the country has also seen an influx of immigrants and refugees from neighboring countries and beyond.\n\nThe population of Greece is expected to continue aging, with significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social security. The low fertility rate and aging population will likely lead to a decrease in the workforce and an increase in the dependency ratio, putting pressure on the pension system and healthcare services. To address these challenges, the government has implemented policies aimed at increasing fertility rates, such as family benefits and childcare support, as well as encouraging immigration and promoting economic growth.\n\nGreece's population is also characterized by a significant urban-rural divide, with many rural areas experiencing depopulation and a lack of access to basic services. The government has implemented initiatives to revitalize rural areas, such as investing in infrastructure, promoting tourism, and supporting local businesses. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities between urban and rural areas and to ensure that all citizens have access to equal opportunities and services.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Greeks | 93% | Throughout the country | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Turks | 2% | Eastern Thrace | Recognized minority group |\n| Macedonians | 1.5% | Northern Greece | Disputed minority group |\n| Albanians | 1% | Northern Greece | Immigrant community |\n| Roma | 0.5% | Throughout the country | Recognized minority group |\n| Armenians | 0.2% | Athens, Thessaloniki | Immigrant community |\n[/TABLE]\nGreece is a multicultural society with a diverse range of ethnic groups, although the dominant group is the Greeks, making up around 93% of the population. The country has a complex history of ethnic relations, with tensions between different groups, particularly between Greeks and Turks. However, in recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of minority rights, and efforts have been made to promote diversity and inclusion. The government has implemented policies aimed at promoting social cohesion and addressing the needs of minority groups, such as language and cultural support, education, and economic empowerment.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Greek** is the official language, spoken by the vast majority of the population\n- Regional languages, such as **Macedonian** and **Arvanitika**, are spoken by minority groups in northern Greece\n- **English** is widely spoken, particularly among the younger population and in tourist areas\n- **Turkish** is spoken by the Turkish minority in eastern Thrace\n- **Roma** languages, such as **Vlax Romani**, are spoken by the Roma community\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Orthodox Christianity | 90% | Dominant religion, closely tied to Greek identity |\n| Islam | 5% | Recognized minority religion, primarily among Turkish and Albanian communities |\n| Catholicism | 1% | Small but significant minority, particularly in the islands |\n| Protestantism | 0.5% | Small minority, primarily among expatriates and converts |\n| Judaism | 0.2% | Small but historic community, primarily in Thessaloniki |\n[/TABLE]\nGreece is a predominantly Orthodox Christian country, with around 90% of the population identifying as Orthodox.
