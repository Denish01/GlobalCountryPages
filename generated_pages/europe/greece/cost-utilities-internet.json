However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity and gas bills during the winter months due to increased heating demands. The Greek government has implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of renewable energy sources, which has led to a decrease in utility costs in recent years. Additionally, the country's mild climate means that air conditioning and heating costs are relatively low compared to other European countries.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Greece is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, there may be occasional disruptions to services, particularly in rural areas. The cost of utilities in Greece is also affected by the country's energy market liberalization, which has led to increased competition among service providers and lower prices for consumers. Despite these developments, the cost of utilities in Greece remains relatively high compared to other European countries, with the average household spending around 10% of its monthly income on utility bills.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | variable depending on usage |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | fixed rate |\n| Gas / Heating | $30 | $50 | $70 | variable depending on usage |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | fixed rate |\n| **Total** | **$140** | **$215** | **$310** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 30 Mbps | OTE, Vodafone |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 100 Mbps | OTE, Vodafone, Wind |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Vodafone, Wind, Cosmote |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | Vodafone, Wind, Cosmote |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-80 | varies | OTE, Vodafone, Wind |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | 2 screens, HD |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | individual plan |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Greek content, HD |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Greece, you will typically need to provide proof of residence and identification to the service provider.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help you monitor and control your energy usage.\n- The best internet providers in Greece are OTE, Vodafone, and Wind, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and adjusting your thermostat to use less energy for heating and cooling.\n- It's also a good idea to shop around and compare prices among different service providers to find the best deals on utilities and internet services.",
