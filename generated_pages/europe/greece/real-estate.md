[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Greek property market has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, with prices dropping drastically during the financial crisis. However, the market has started to recover, with a steady increase in prices and demand. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available at competitive prices. Urban areas, such as Athens and Thessaloniki, tend to have higher prices and rental yields compared to rural areas. The **Golden Visa** program, which offers residency in exchange for a property investment, has also attracted many foreign buyers.

The price trajectory of the Greek property market is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by tourism, foreign investment, and government initiatives. The **tourism sector** has been a key driver of the economy, with many investors looking to capitalize on the country's rich history, culture, and natural beauty. Rural areas, on the other hand, offer a more relaxed pace of life and a lower cost of living, making them an attractive option for retirees or those looking for a second home.

The Greek government has implemented various measures to stimulate the property market, including tax incentives and simplified procedures for foreign buyers. These initiatives have contributed to an increase in demand, particularly from foreign investors. As a result, the property market in Greece is becoming increasingly attractive to international buyers, with many seeing it as a viable investment opportunity.
