Peak season: June, July, and August. Budget season: November, December, January, and February. Avoid: August due to extreme heat and crowds, and January and February if you're not comfortable with cooler weather and potential rain. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nGreece has a Mediterranean climate with four distinct seasons, each with its own characteristics. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the **Mediterranean climate** in the south, the **Alpine climate** in the mountains, and the **temperate climate** in the north. The dry season, which lasts from April to October, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, with minimal rainfall. In contrast, the wet season, which lasts from November to March, is cooler and rainier, with the most significant amount of precipitation occurring between December and February. The seasons significantly affect travel in Greece, with the peak season attracting large crowds and higher prices, while the off-season offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower costs.\n\nThe summer months are the busiest time of the year, with schools on summer break and families on vacation. The heat can be intense, especially in July and August, making it essential to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade. On the other hand, the spring and autumn months offer mild temperatures, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, and sailing. The winter months are the quietest time of the year, with some tourist facilities and attractions closed, but it's still a great time to visit if you're looking for a more peaceful experience.\n\nGreece's geography also plays a significant role in determining the climate and weather patterns. The **mountainous regions** can be quite cold during the winter months, while the **coastal areas** tend to be milder. The **islands** in the Aegean and Ionian seas have a unique microclimate, with the northern islands experiencing a cooler and rainier climate than the southern islands.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Winter sports, city breaks |\n| February | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Winter sports, city breaks |\n| March | Mild and sunny | Low | $ | Spring festivals, hiking |\n| April | Mild and sunny | Medium | $$ | Spring festivals, hiking, beach activities |\n| May | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Beach activities, water sports, island hopping |\n| June | Hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beach activities, water sports, island hopping |\n| July | Very hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beach activities, water sports, island hopping |\n| August | Very hot and sunny | High | $$$ | Beach activities, water sports, island hopping |\n| September | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Beach activities, water sports, island hopping |\n| October | Mild and sunny | Medium | $$ | Autumn festivals, hiking, city breaks |\n| November | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Autumn festivals, city breaks, winter sports |\n| December | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Winter festivals, city breaks, winter sports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Patras Carnival | January-February | One of the largest and most famous carnivals in Greece, featuring parades, music, and dancing |\n| Athens Festival | June-September | A summer festival featuring music, theater, and dance performances at various venues in Athens |\n| Full Moon Festival | August | A festival celebrating the full moon, with music, dance, and theater performances at the ancient theater of Epidaurus |\n| Thessaloniki International Film Festival | November | A film festival showcasing Greek and international films, with screenings, workshops, and masterclasses |\n| Christmas and New Year's Celebrations | December | Traditional Christmas and New Year's celebrations, with markets, decorations, and festivities throughout the country |\n| Easter Celebrations | March-April | Traditional Easter celebrations, with processions, music, and feasting throughout the country |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **island of Crete** has a unique climate, with the southern coast being warmer and drier than the northern coast.\n- The **Peloponnese region** experiences a more extreme climate, with hot summers and cold winters.\n- The **Mount Olympus region** is known for its cooler and rainier climate, making it ideal for hiking and winter sports.\n- The **Aegean islands** tend to be cooler and rainier than the **Ionian islands**, which are generally warmer and sunnier.\n- The **city of Athens** has a more moderate climate, with hot summers and mild winters, making it a great destination year-round.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, when prices are lower and the weather is still pleasant.\n- Pack accordingly, with light clothing for the summer months and warm clothing for the winter months.\n- Don't forget to bring sun protection, such as sunscreen and a hat, during the summer months.\n- Be aware of public holidays and festivals, which can affect the opening hours of attractions and the availability of public transportation.\n- Rent a car or book a guided tour to explore the countryside and rural areas, which can be challenging to access using public transportation.",
