[SECTION] Overview: Greece vs North Macedonia [/SECTION]
Greece and North Macedonia are two neighboring countries in southeastern Europe, with distinct economies and cost of living profiles. Greece, a member of the European Union, has a more developed economy and a higher standard of living, which is reflected in its prices. North Macedonia, on the other hand, is a smaller, more affordable country with a lower cost of living. The main difference between the two countries is the price level, with Greece being around 20-30% more expensive than North Macedonia. This is due to various factors, including the strength of the euro, the country's high standard of living, and its popularity as a tourist destination.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Greece has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on services, industry, and tourism, while North Macedonia's economy is more reliant on agriculture and manufacturing. This difference in economic structure contributes to the variation in prices between the two countries. Additionally, the cost of living in Greece is also influenced by its geographical location, with the country being a popular destination for tourists and expats, which drives up prices, especially in cities like Athens and the islands. In contrast, North Macedonia is a more off-the-beaten-path destination, which keeps prices lower.
