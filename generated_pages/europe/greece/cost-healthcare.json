  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Greece can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 34.3% of total health expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $44,327 (in terms of GDP per capita PPP)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 34.3%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 166\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGreece has a mixed healthcare system, which combines elements of both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system, known as the National Health System (ESY), provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens, including access to doctors, hospitals, and other medical services. However, the quality of public healthcare services can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific hospital or clinic. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the first point of contact for medical care, while foreigners may prefer to use private healthcare services due to language barriers and perceived quality differences.\n\nThe Greek healthcare system is generally well-regarded, with a wide range of medical services available, including specialized treatments and advanced diagnostic equipment. However, the system can be bureaucratic, and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. For foreigners, it is recommended to have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high. Many private health insurance plans are available, offering a range of coverage options and prices. It is essential to research and compares different plans to find the one that best suits your needs and budget.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by location and dentist's qualifications |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by location and optometrist's qualifications |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Prices vary by location and laboratory |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Prices vary by type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by location and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Prices vary by location and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialized treatments, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Worldwide coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary by pharmacy and location, but are generally lower than in other European countries.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets.\n- Certain medications, such as painkillers and antibiotics, require a prescription from a doctor.\n- Pharmacy hours vary by location, but most are open from 8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday.\n- Some pharmacies offer 24-hour emergency services.\n- Medication prices are generally lower in public pharmacies than in private ones.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 166, or visit the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are widely available, and emergency rooms are equipped to handle a range of medical conditions. For foreigners, it is recommended to visit a private hospital, as they often have English-speaking staff and better facilities. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Greece include the Athens Medical Center, the Hygeia Hospital, and the Mitera Hospital. These hospitals offer a range of medical services, including emergency care, specialized treatments, and advanced diagnostic equipment. It is essential to have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high. [CALLOUT] It is crucial to research and choose a reputable hospital and doctor to ensure you receive the best possible care. [/CALLOUT]\n\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to remain calm and follow the instructions of medical personnel. If you are unable to speak Greek, it may be helpful to have a translation app or a friend who can assist with communication. Many hospitals and medical facilities have English-speaking staff, but it is still a good idea to learn some basic Greek phrases, such as \"where is the hospital?\" or \"I need a doctor.\" [RATING] The overall quality of emergency care in Greece is **4/5**, with modern facilities and well-trained medical staff. However, language barriers and bureaucracy can sometimes be a challenge.",
