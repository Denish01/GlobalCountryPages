Greece and Turkey are two neighboring countries with distinct economic profiles. Greece, a member of the European Union, has a more developed economy with a higher GDP per capita. However, the country has faced economic challenges in recent years, including high debt and unemployment.

Despite these differences, both countries offer a unique cultural and historical experience for visitors and expats. In terms of cost of living, Greece tends to be more expensive than Turkey, particularly when it comes to housing, food, and transportation.

Rent, in particular, is a major factor in the overall cost of living, with prices in Greece often 30-50% higher than in Turkey. Food and dining costs also vary, with traditional Turkish cuisine often cheaper than its Greek counterpart. However, it's worth noting that prices can fluctuate depending on the location, with major cities like Athens and Istanbul tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.
