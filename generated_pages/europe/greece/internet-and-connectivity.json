However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in major cities like Athens and Thessaloniki, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall reliability of the internet in Greece is relatively high, with most users experiencing minimal downtime and few issues with connectivity.\n\nGreece has made significant investments in its telecommunications infrastructure in recent years, resulting in improved internet speeds and coverage across the country. This has enabled the widespread adoption of online services, including e-government, e-commerce, and streaming platforms, making it easier for tourists and locals alike to access the information and services they need. Additionally, the Greek government has implemented initiatives to expand broadband coverage to rural areas, aiming to bridge the digital divide and promote economic development in these regions.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Greece, you can visit a store of one of the main carriers, such as Cosmote, Vodafone, or Wind, and provide a valid passport and proof of address. You can also purchase a tourist SIM card at airports, ports, and other tourist destinations, which usually come with a set amount of data and minutes. Recommended carriers for tourists include Cosmote and Vodafone, which offer a range of data plans and competitive pricing. It's also possible to buy a SIM card from smaller, prepaid carriers like QTelecom or F2G, which may offer more affordable options for short-term use.\n\nWhen purchasing a SIM card, you'll typically need to provide your passport and proof of address, and you may be required to register your SIM card with the carrier. This process usually takes a few minutes, and you'll receive a new SIM card with a Greek phone number. You can then top up your account with credit or purchase a data plan, which can be done online or at a carrier store.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cosmote | Tourist Pack | 10 GB | 15 | includes 100 minutes and 100 SMS |\n| Vodafone | Red Tourist | 5 GB | 10 | includes 50 minutes and 50 SMS |\n| Wind | Tourist SIM | 2 GB | 5 | includes 20 minutes and 20 SMS |\n| QTelecom | Prepaid SIM | 1 GB | 3 | no contract or registration required |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels and resorts offering free WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is prevalent in Greece, with many cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular in major cities, offering reliable and fast WiFi, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and networking events\n- Public WiFi is available in many cities and towns, including at airports, ports, and other tourist destinations\n- Many museums, galleries, and historical sites also offer free WiFi, making it easy to access information and plan your visit\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like The Cube and Impact Hub offer reliable and fast WiFi, as well as other amenities like meeting rooms and networking events\n- Reliable cafe chains like Starbucks and Costa Coffee offer good WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options like portable WiFi hotspots and mobile data plans are available for purchase or rent\n- VPNs are recommended for secure and private browsing, especially when using public WiFi networks\n- Many libraries and bookstores also offer free WiFi and a quiet working environment, making them a good option for remote workers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is relatively low in Greece, but some online content may be blocked or restricted\n- **VPN** use is recommended to ensure secure and private browsing, especially when using public WiFi networks\n- Roaming alternatives like portable WiFi hotspots and local SIM cards can be more cost-effective than roaming with your home carrier\n- eSIM options are available from some carriers, offering a convenient and flexible way to stay connected\n- Public WiFi networks can be vulnerable to hacking and other security threats, so it's essential to take precautions like using a VPN and keeping your device and software up to date\n- When purchasing a SIM card or data plan, be sure to check the coverage and speeds in your area to ensure you get the best service for your needs.",
