The quality of education in Greece is generally high, with a strong focus on **theoretical knowledge** and **academic achievement**. While public education is free and widely available, many parents choose to send their children to private schools, which are often seen as providing a higher quality of education.\n\nThe Greek education system is overseen by the **Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs**, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, funding schools, and overseeing the administration of the education system. Despite the many strengths of the Greek education system, there are also some challenges, including **overcrowding** in public schools and a lack of resources in some areas. In recent years, the government has implemented a number of reforms aimed at addressing these challenges and improving the overall quality of education in Greece.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the Greek education system is its emphasis on **classical education**, with a strong focus on the study of ancient Greek language and culture. This has helped to produce a highly educated and cultured population, with a deep appreciation for the arts and humanities. However, it has also been criticized for being overly **theoretical**, with some arguing that it does not provide students with the practical skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the modern workforce.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
