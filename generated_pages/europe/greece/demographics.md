[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Greece has a relatively small population compared to other European countries, with a total of approximately 10.4 million people. The population has been growing at a slow rate of 0.3% per annum, primarily due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. The majority of the population, around 78%, resides in urban areas, with the largest cities being Athens and Thessaloniki. Greece has a long history of migration, with many Greeks emigrating to other countries, particularly during the economic crisis of the 2000s. However, in recent years, the country has also seen an influx of immigrants and refugees from neighboring countries and beyond.

The population of Greece is expected to continue aging, with significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social security. The low fertility rate and aging population will likely lead to a decrease in the workforce and an increase in the dependency ratio, putting pressure on the pension system and healthcare services. To address these challenges, the government has implemented policies aimed at increasing fertility rates, such as family benefits and childcare support, as well as encouraging immigration and promoting economic growth.

Greece's population is also characterized by a significant urban-rural divide, with many rural areas experiencing depopulation and a lack of access to basic services. The government has implemented initiatives to revitalize rural areas, such as investing in infrastructure, promoting tourism, and supporting local businesses. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities between urban and rural areas and to ensure that all citizens have access to equal opportunities and services.
