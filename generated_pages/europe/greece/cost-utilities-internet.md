[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Greece has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a stable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity and gas bills during the winter months due to increased heating demands. The Greek government has implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of renewable energy sources, which has led to a decrease in utility costs in recent years. Additionally, the country's mild climate means that air conditioning and heating costs are relatively low compared to other European countries.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Greece is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, there may be occasional disruptions to services, particularly in rural areas. The cost of utilities in Greece is also affected by the country's energy market liberalization, which has led to increased competition among service providers and lower prices for consumers. Despite these developments, the cost of utilities in Greece remains relatively high compared to other European countries, with the average household spending around 10% of its monthly income on utility bills.
