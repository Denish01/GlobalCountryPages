[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Greece has a **territorial taxation** system, which means that individuals are taxed on their income earned within the country, regardless of their residency status. However, individuals who are considered **tax residents** are subject to **worldwide taxation**, meaning they are taxed on their global income, not just their Greek-sourced income. To be considered a tax resident in Greece, an individual must have their permanent home in the country, or spend more than 183 days in Greece within a calendar year.

The Greek tax system is based on the principle of **self-assessment**, where taxpayers are required to file their tax returns and pay their taxes on a voluntary basis. The tax authorities may conduct audits to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations. Taxpayers who are considered tax residents in Greece are required to file a tax return, even if they have no taxable income. Non-resident individuals are only required to file a tax return if they have income derived from Greek sources.
