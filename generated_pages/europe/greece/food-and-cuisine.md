[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Greece's cuisine is defined by its Mediterranean location, with a focus on fresh vegetables, fruits, and seafood. The country's culinary identity has been shaped by its history, with influences from ancient Greece, the Byzantine Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. As a result, Greek cuisine is characterized by a blend of traditional and modern flavors, with a emphasis on local ingredients and simple preparation methods. Regional variations are also significant, with different parts of the country having their own unique specialties and ingredients. For example, the island of Crete is known for its **Cretan cuisine**, which features dishes such as **stifado** (a beef stew) and **melomakarona** (Christmas cookies).

Greek cuisine is also known for its emphasis on social eating and hospitality, with mealtimes often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends. This is reflected in the traditional Greek **taverna**, where guests can enjoy a wide range of small dishes, known as **mezethes**, while socializing and drinking. The country's cuisine has also been influenced by its **Orthodox Christian heritage**, with many dishes and ingredients having religious significance. For example, **lagana** (a type of flatbread) is traditionally eaten on **Clean Monday**, the first day of Lent.

In recent years, Greek cuisine has experienced a resurgence in popularity, with many modern restaurants and chefs reinterpreting traditional dishes and ingredients in innovative ways. This has led to a vibrant and dynamic food scene, with a wide range of options available to suit different tastes and budgets. From traditional **souvlaki** shops to modern **gastronomic restaurants**, Greece has something to offer every type of food lover.
