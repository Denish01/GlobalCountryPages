These regions are further divided into 54 regional units, which are then divided into municipalities. The 13 regions of Greece are: Attica, Central Greece, Central Macedonia, Crete, East Macedonia and Thrace, Epirus, Ionian Islands, North Aegean, Peloponnese, South Aegean, Thessaly, and West Greece. The autonomous region of Mount Athos is a self-governing entity that is home to several monasteries and is not part of any region.\n\nThe administrative structure of Greece is designed to promote regional development and decentralization. Each region has its own regional council, which is responsible for implementing regional policies and managing regional funds. The regional units, on the other hand, are responsible for providing local services such as healthcare, education, and transportation. This system allows for a more effective distribution of resources and a greater level of autonomy for local authorities.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Athens** (3.7M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, vibrant nightlife, and iconic landmarks such as the Acropolis and the Parthenon\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and partygoers\n**Thessaloniki** (790,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, port city\nKnown For: its vibrant waterfront, historic landmarks such as the White Tower, and its thriving arts and cultural scene\nBest For: business travelers, cultural enthusiasts, and foodies\n**Piraeus** (170,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its bustling port, historic landmarks such as the Piraeus Archaeological Museum, and its lively nightlife\nBest For: business travelers, cruise passengers, and shoppers\n**Patras** (170,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, port city\nKnown For: its vibrant waterfront, historic landmarks such as the Patras Castle, and its thriving arts and cultural scene\nBest For: business travelers, cultural enthusiasts, and families\n**Heraklion** (140,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, vibrant cultural scene, and iconic landmarks such as the Palace of Knossos\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and families\n**Larissa** (160,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, vibrant cultural scene, and iconic landmarks such as the Larissa Ancient Theater\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and families\n**Volos** (120,000)\nRole: economic hub, port city\nKnown For: its bustling port, historic landmarks such as the Volos Archaeological Museum, and its lively nightlife\nBest For: business travelers, cruise passengers, and shoppers\n**Rhodes** (50,000)\nRole: tourist hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning beaches, historic landmarks such as the Acropolis of Rhodes, and its vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: tourists, beachgoers, and history buffs\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Attica | Urban, coastal | Athens, Piraeus, beaches | Athens |\n| Central Greece | Mountainous, rural | Delphi, mountains, forests | Lamia |\n| Central Macedonia | Urban, coastal | Thessaloniki, beaches, nightlife | Thessaloniki |\n| Crete | Island, rural | Beaches, mountains, ancient ruins | Heraklion |\n| East Macedonia and Thrace | Rural, mountainous | Forests, mountains, traditional villages | Komotini |\n| Epirus | Mountainous, rural | Mountains, forests, traditional villages | Ioannina |\n| Ionian Islands | Island, coastal | Beaches, scenic villages, vibrant nightlife | Corfu |\n| North Aegean | Island, coastal | Beaches, scenic villages, vibrant nightlife | Mytilene |\n| Peloponnese | Peninsula, rural | Ancient ruins, beaches, traditional villages | Patras |\n| South Aegean | Island, coastal | Beaches, scenic villages, vibrant nightlife | Rhodes |\n| Thessaly | Rural, mountainous | Mountains, forests, traditional villages | Larissa |\n| West Greece | Rural, mountainous | Mountains, forests, traditional villages | Patras |\n| Mount Athos | Autonomous, mountainous | Monasteries, scenic villages, traditional way of life | Karyes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Greece differ significantly in terms of culture, with some regions having a stronger emphasis on traditional music and dance, while others have a more vibrant arts and cultural scene.\n- The economy of each region also varies, with some regions relying heavily on tourism, while others have a stronger focus on agriculture or industry.\n- The climate of Greece also varies by region, with some regions having a Mediterranean climate, while others have a more alpine or oceanic climate.\n- The language spoken in each region is primarily Greek, although some regions have a stronger presence of minority languages such as Turkish or Macedonian.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nGreece has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and ferries connecting major cities and regions.
