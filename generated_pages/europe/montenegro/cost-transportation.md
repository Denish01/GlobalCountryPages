[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Montenegro has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with buses being the primary mode of public transport. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major cities and towns. Most people in Montenegro get around by using public buses or minivans, which are affordable and convenient. However, the country's mountainous terrain can make road travel challenging, especially during winter months. The capital city, Podgorica, has a comprehensive bus network, while other cities like Kotor and Budva rely on a combination of buses and taxis.

The country's scenic coastline and picturesque towns make it a popular destination for tourists, and many visitors choose to explore Montenegro by car or on foot. The roads in Montenegro are generally in good condition, but driving can be challenging due to the country's rugged terrain and narrow roads. Alternatively, visitors can use taxis or ride-hailing services, which are widely available in major cities. With a GDP per capita PPP of $34,807 (2024) and an inflation rate of 3.3% (2024), Montenegro offers a relatively affordable transportation system compared to other European countries.
