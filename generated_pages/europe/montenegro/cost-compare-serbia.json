Montenegro has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed tourist industry, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Serbia, on the other hand, has a larger population and a more diverse economy, which helps keep costs lower. Overall, Serbia is generally cheaper than Montenegro, with a difference of around 15-20% in the overall cost of living.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Montenegro has a high dependence on tourism, which drives up prices for accommodation, food, and other services during the peak season. Serbia, with its more diversified economy, is less dependent on tourism, and prices are generally more stable throughout the year. Additionally, Serbia has a larger market and a more competitive economy, which helps keep prices lower.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montenegro (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 350 | 22% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 300 | 250 | 17% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 600 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montenegro (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 250 | 17% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 2.5 | 17% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1.5 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montenegro (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 25 | 17% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.5 | 1.2 | 20% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1.1 | 8% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montenegro (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 120 | 20% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 25 | 17% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Montenegro (USD) | Serbia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 650 | 19% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 1,000 | 17% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,600 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Montenegro is cheaper for:**\n- Renting a car for a short period\n- Buying luxury goods\n- Enjoying high-end dining experiences\n- Taking a guided tour\n- **Serbia is cheaper for:**\n- Renting an apartment long-term\n- Buying groceries and everyday items\n- Using public transportation\n- Enjoying traditional cuisine at local restaurants\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Serbia offers better value for money, with a lower cost of living and a more affordable lifestyle.
