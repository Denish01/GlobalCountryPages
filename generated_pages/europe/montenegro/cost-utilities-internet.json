However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased heating demands.

Despite these fluctuations, the overall quality of utility services in Montenegro is considered to be good, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Montenegro is also influenced by the country's geography, with mountainous regions experiencing higher costs due to the difficulty of accessing and maintaining utility infrastructure.
