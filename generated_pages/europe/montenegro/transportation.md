[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Montenegro has two main international airports, Podgorica Airport (TGD) and Tivat Airport (TIV), which receive direct flights from major European cities such as London, Paris, and Moscow. Podgorica Airport is the larger of the two and is located about 11 kilometers south of the capital city, while Tivat Airport is situated on the coast, near the popular tourist destination of Kotor. If you're coming from neighboring countries, you can also enter Montenegro by land or sea, with overland entry points at the borders with Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, and Albania.

In addition to flying, you can also reach Montenegro by bus or train from nearby countries, although the options may be limited. For example, there are bus connections from Dubrovnik in Croatia and Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while trains run from Belgrade in Serbia. If you're arriving by sea, you can take a ferry from Italy or other Adriatic ports to the coastal towns of Bar or Kotor.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in Montenegro are limited, with only a few routes available between the two international airports and some smaller airfields. The main domestic airline is Montenegro Airlines, which operates flights between Podgorica and Tivat, as well as to some regional destinations. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agency, with prices starting from around 50-100 euros for a one-way ticket. However, due to the limited network and frequent schedule changes, it's a good idea to check with the airline for the latest information and to book in advance to secure the best rates.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Montenegro's rail network is limited, with only a few routes available, including the main line from the capital Podgorica to the northern town of Bijelo Polje and the coastal town of Bar. The trains are relatively slow and not always reliable, but they can be a scenic way to see the countryside. There are no high-speed trains in Montenegro, and the booking process can be complicated, with limited online options. However, you can buy tickets at the train station or through a travel agency, with prices starting from around 5-10 euros for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses are a popular way to get around Montenegro, with an extensive network of routes connecting major towns and cities. The main bus companies are Blue Line, Centar, and Budva, which operate modern and comfortable coaches with air conditioning and reclining seats. You can buy tickets at the bus station or online, with prices starting from around 5-10 euros for a one-way ticket. The bus network covers most of the country, including the coastal towns and the mountains, although the frequency and quality of the services can vary depending on the route and the time of year.
