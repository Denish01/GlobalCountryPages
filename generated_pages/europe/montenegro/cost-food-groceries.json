The country's strategic location on the Adriatic coast and its proximity to European markets contribute to a diverse and relatively affordable food scene. However, prices can be driven up by factors such as tourism, import costs, and seasonal fluctuations. Eating out is a popular pastime in Montenegro, with many restaurants, cafes, and bars offering a range of local and international cuisine. Nevertheless, home cooking remains a staple in Montenegrin culture, with many locals preferring to prepare traditional dishes using fresh, locally-sourced ingredients.\n\nThe cost of food in Montenegro can also vary depending on the location, with coastal towns and tourist areas tend to be more expensive than inland regions. Additionally, the country's growing tourism industry has led to an increase in high-end restaurants and bars, which can drive up prices. However, for those on a budget, there are still many affordable options available, including traditional eateries, street food stalls, and local markets. Overall, Montenegro offers a unique and flavorful food scene that caters to a range of tastes and budgets.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.20 | 1.00 EUR | Fresh, whole milk |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | 1.25 EUR | Standard, store-bought loaf |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 1.70 EUR | Fresh, farm-produced eggs |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.80 | 1.50 EUR | White, long-grain rice |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 5.00 EUR | Boneless, skinless chicken breast |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 8.50 EUR | Ground beef or beef cuts |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50 | 2.10 EUR | Fresh, seasonal apples |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00 | 1.70 EUR | Fresh, seasonal tomatoes |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 1.25 EUR | Fresh, seasonal potatoes |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.20 | 1.00 EUR | Fresh, seasonal onions |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 6.80 EUR | Traditional, farm-produced cheese |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.50 | 1.25 EUR | Still, bottled water |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | Traditional dishes like ćevapi, burek, or seafood |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$25 | One person, two courses, including a drink |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$40 | Three courses, including a drink, for two people |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$80 | Upscale, multi-course meal for two people |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | Domestic beer, served in a bar or restaurant |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$6 | International beer, served in a bar or restaurant |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | Coffee, served in a cafe or bar |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | Fizzy drinks, like cola or lemon-lime soda |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to grocery shopping in Montenegro, there are two main options: supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including international brands and convenience foods, but prices can be higher. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh, seasonal produce and traditional products at lower prices. However, the selection may be limited, and bargaining is often expected. In general, it's best to buy fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods, household items, and international products.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with local markets often offering better value for money. For example, a kilogram of fresh tomatoes may cost $2.00 at a supermarket, but only $1.50 at a local market. Additionally, local markets often offer a more authentic shopping experience, with the opportunity to interact with local vendors and sample traditional products. However, supermarkets can be more convenient, with longer opening hours and a wider range of products. Ultimately, the choice between supermarkets and local markets depends on individual preferences and priorities.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries or street food stalls is often the cheapest way to eat, with traditional dishes like ćevapi or burek costing around $5-$10.\n- Local staples like bread, cheese, and produce are generally good value and can be found at markets or supermarkets.\n- Avoid buying imported products, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- Consider purchasing **local wine** or **rakia**, which are often cheaper and of high quality.\n- For a unique and affordable dining experience, try a **peka**, a traditional slow-cooked meat or vegetable dish.\n- When shopping at local markets, be prepared to **haggle** and negotiate prices, especially for larger or more expensive items.",
