[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Montenegro is a small country located in southeastern Europe, in the Balkan Peninsula. It is bordered by five countries: Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the southeast. The country has a coastline along the Adriatic Sea to the southwest, which provides access to the Mediterranean Sea. The terrain is varied, with mountains, hills, and a narrow coastal plain. The location of Montenegro makes it a strategic crossing point between eastern and western Europe.

The country's borders are relatively short, with a total length of approximately 614 kilometers. The border with Croatia is the longest, at around 125 kilometers, while the border with Albania is the shortest, at around 62 kilometers. The terrain along the borders is mostly mountainous, with some valleys and rivers that form natural boundaries. The Adriatic coastline is an important feature of Montenegro, providing a scenic and economically valuable resource. The country's location and borders have played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Montenegro's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, hills, and coastal plains. The Dinaric Alps run along the western border with Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with peaks reaching elevations of over 2,000 meters. The highest point in the country is Zla Kolata, which is located in the Prokletije Mountains. The mountains are covered with forests, including beech, oak, and pine trees, and are home to a variety of wildlife, including bears, wolves, and eagles.

The central part of the country is a plateau, with elevations ranging from 500 to 1,000 meters. This region is home to several rivers, including the Moraca and the Zeta, which flow through valleys and canyons. The coastal plain is narrow, with a width of around 10-20 kilometers, and is home to several cities, including Kotor and Ulcinj. The plain is bounded by the Bay of Kotor, a fjord-like inlet that is one of the most beautiful and scenic parts of the country. The terrain in Montenegro is varied and rugged, with many opportunities for outdoor activities, such as hiking, skiing, and water sports.

The country's landscape has been shaped by its geological history, with the Dinaric Alps forming as a result of tectonic activity. The mountains have been eroded over time, creating a range of landscapes, from steep cliffs and canyons to gentle valleys and plains. The coastal plain is a relatively recent feature, formed as a result of sea level changes and sedimentation. The varied terrain and landscape of Montenegro have created a range of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands, which support a diverse range of flora and fauna.
