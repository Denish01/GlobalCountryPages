The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with modern medical facilities and well-trained medical staff. However, it can be slow and bureaucratic, with long waiting times for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers more prompt and specialized care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the first point of contact, with private healthcare being used to supplement or speed up treatment. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers more English-speaking staff and a more streamlined service.\n\nThe healthcare system in Montenegro is generally well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific facility. In general, the larger cities such as Podgorica and Kotor tend to have better-equipped and more modern medical facilities, while smaller towns and rural areas may have more limited resources. It is generally recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance, as this can help to cover the cost of private healthcare and provide access to a wider range of medical services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public healthcare often requires a referral from a primary care physician |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private healthcare often offers more specialized care and shorter waiting times |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dental care can be more expensive, but often offers more modern facilities and equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public healthcare may not always have the latest equipment or technology |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private healthcare often offers more comprehensive testing and faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public healthcare is generally free for emergency services, but may require a small copayment |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | Private healthcare can be significantly more expensive, but often offers more modern facilities and better care |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | The cost of surgery can vary significantly depending on the procedure and the facility |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,500 | Private healthcare often offers more comprehensive prenatal care and a more personalized birth experience |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Public healthcare may have longer waiting times for diagnostic tests |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Private healthcare often offers more modern equipment and faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, including specialist consultations, surgery, and diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Comprehensive coverage, including evacuation and repatriation, and access to a global network of medical providers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies throughout Montenegro, with prices varying depending on the type and brand of medication.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, with many pharmacies offering a range of products, including pain relievers, antihistamines, and cold medications.\n- The cost of medication can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and the location, with prices often being higher in tourist areas.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts or promotions, especially for larger purchases or for loyalty program members.\n- It is generally recommended to have a prescription from a doctor before purchasing medication, especially for controlled substances or specialized treatments.\n- Pharmacy hours can vary, but many are open from 8am to 8pm, Monday to Saturday, with some pharmacies offering 24-hour emergency services.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112, which will connect you to a trained operator who can dispatch an ambulance or provide instructions for emergency care. Ambulances are widely available, but may not always be equipped with the latest medical equipment. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical attention at a private hospital or clinic, as these facilities often have more modern equipment and better-trained staff.

This can help to prevent accidents and injuries, and can also provide valuable skills in the event of an emergency. Additionally, it is recommended to research local medical facilities and emergency services before traveling, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. This can help to ensure that you receive the best possible care, and can also provide peace of mind while traveling in a foreign country.",
