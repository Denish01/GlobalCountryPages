[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
Montenegro's internet quality is generally good, with an average download speed of 24 Mbps, which is comparable to other European countries. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in cities like Podgorica and Budva, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall internet infrastructure is relatively stable, with most users experiencing minimal downtime and decent connectivity.

The reliability of the internet in Montenegro is also influenced by the type of connection used, with fiber-optic connections generally being more stable than mobile or satellite connections. Additionally, the country's geography, with its mountainous terrain, can also impact internet connectivity, particularly in rural areas. Nevertheless, Montenegro has made significant investments in its internet infrastructure in recent years, and the quality of the internet is continually improving.
