  "content": "The population of Montenegro is approximately 623,327 people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that reflect the country's complex history and geographical location. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 0.62 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.01%\nMedian Age: 37.7 years\nUrban Population: 63.3%\nPopulation Density: 45 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 76.4 years\nFertility Rate: 1.6 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nMontenegro's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but it has a unique demographic profile. The country has experienced a slow population growth rate, largely due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. Urbanization is a significant trend in Montenegro, with the majority of the population living in urban areas, particularly in the capital city Podgorica. Migration patterns have also played a role in shaping the country's demographics, with many Montenegrins emigrating to other European countries in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of Montenegro is expected to continue aging, with significant implications for the country's labor market, pension system, and healthcare services. To address these challenges, the government has implemented policies aimed at increasing fertility rates and encouraging immigration. However, the country's demographic future remains uncertain, and it will be important to monitor population trends and adjust policies accordingly.\n\nMontenegro's population size and growth rate are also influenced by its geographical location and economic factors. The country's mountainous terrain and limited job opportunities have contributed to a brain drain, with many young and educated Montenegrins leaving the country to seek better prospects abroad. On the other hand, tourism and foreign investment have created new opportunities for economic growth and development, which could help to attract new residents and stimulate population growth.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Montenegrins | 45% | throughout the country | dominant ethnic group |\n| Serbs | 28% | north and central regions | significant minority |\n| Bosniaks | 11% | north and east regions | Muslim minority |\n| Albanians | 5% | south and east regions | minority with cultural and linguistic ties to Albania |\n| Croats | 1% | coastal regions | small but significant minority |\n| Roma | 0.5% | throughout the country | marginalized minority |\n[/TABLE]\nMontenegro's ethnic diversity is a significant aspect of its cultural identity, with several ethnic groups coexisting and interacting with one another.
