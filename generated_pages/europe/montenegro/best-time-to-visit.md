[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Montenegro has a Mediterranean climate, with warm and dry summers, and mild and wet winters. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal region, the mountainous region, and the central region. The coastal region has a typical Mediterranean climate, with hot summers and mild winters, while the mountainous region has a more continental climate, with cold winters and cool summers. The central region has a mix of both climates, with warm summers and mild winters. The best time to visit Montenegro depends on the region and the activities you want to do. The dry season, from May to September, is the best time to visit the coastal region, while the mountainous region is best visited during the summer months, from June to August.

The seasons in Montenegro affect travel in different ways. During the peak season, from July to August, the coastal towns and beaches are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are high. However, this is the best time to enjoy the country's beautiful beaches, water sports, and outdoor activities. During the shoulder season, from April to June and September to October, the weather is still warm and sunny, but the crowds are smaller, and prices are lower. This is a great time to explore the country's historic towns, national parks, and mountains. During the low season, from November to March, the weather is cold and rainy, and many tourist facilities are closed.

The weather in Montenegro can be unpredictable, especially in the mountainous region, where snow can fall during the winter months, and thunderstorms can occur during the summer months. However, the country's unique geography, with its rugged mountains, scenic coastline, and pristine lakes, makes it a great destination for outdoor enthusiasts, regardless of the season.
