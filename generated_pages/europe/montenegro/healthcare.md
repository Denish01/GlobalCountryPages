[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Montenegro's healthcare system is based on a combination of public and private providers, with a strong emphasis on preventive care. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and social health insurance, which covers all citizens and provides access to a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions. The private sector plays a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, particularly in urban areas, where there are many private clinics and hospitals that offer high-quality care. The quality of care in Montenegro is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical equipment, especially in the capital city of Podgorica and other urban areas. However, access to healthcare services can be limited in rural areas, where there may be fewer medical facilities and specialists available.

The public healthcare system in Montenegro is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary care levels, with primary care provided by general practitioners and secondary care provided by specialists in hospitals and clinics. Tertiary care is provided by specialized hospitals and institutes, which offer advanced medical treatments and procedures. The healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for developing healthcare policies, regulating healthcare providers, and ensuring the quality of care.

In terms of access to healthcare, urban areas in Montenegro have a higher concentration of medical facilities and specialists, making it easier for people to access medical care. However, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services, with fewer medical facilities and specialists available. To address this issue, the government has implemented programs to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the deployment of mobile medical units and the establishment of telemedicine services.
