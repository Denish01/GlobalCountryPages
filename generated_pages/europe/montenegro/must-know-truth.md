# The Truth About Montenegro - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Montenegro, officially known as the Republic of Montenegro, is a sovereign country located in Southeastern Europe. The country's strategic position at the intersection of the Adriatic Sea and the Balkan Peninsula has made it an attractive location for various empires and civilizations throughout history. The earliest known human presence in the region dates back to the **Paleolithic Era**, around 12,000 years ago. The area was later inhabited by the **Illyrians**, a group of ancient tribes that lived in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula.

In the 1st century AD, the region was conquered by the **Roman Empire**, which left a lasting legacy in the country's architecture, language, and culture. With the decline of the Roman Empire, Montenegro was invaded by various barbarian tribes, including the **Slavs**, who arrived in the 6th century AD. The Slavs established the **Duklja** state, which was a medieval South Slavic state that existed from the 10th to the 12th century. In the 14th century, the **Balšić** and **Crnojević** dynasties ruled the region, followed by the **Ottoman Empire**, which conquered Montenegro in the 15th century.

Montenegro declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, following the **Treaty of Berlin**, which recognized the country as a sovereign state. However, it was not until 1910 that Montenegro was officially proclaimed a kingdom, with **King Nicholas I** as its ruler. During **World War I**, Montenegro fought alongside the **Allies**, but was eventually occupied by the **Austro-Hungarian Empire**. After the war, Montenegro became part of the **Kingdom of Yugoslavia**, which was formed in 1918.

In the 1990s, Montenegro became part of the **Federal Republic of Yugoslavia**, along with Serbia. However, the country's desire for independence led to a referendum in 2006, in which the majority of Montenegrins voted in favor of independence. On June 3, 2006, Montenegro officially declared its independence from Serbia and became a sovereign state.
