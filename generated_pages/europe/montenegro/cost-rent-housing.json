Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month deposit required, which is usually refundable at the end of the lease. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with the landlord required to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, Montenegro's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Croatia but higher than in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Serbia.\n\nThe housing market in Montenegro is also influenced by the country's tourism industry, with many apartments and houses being rented out to tourists during the summer months. This can lead to a shortage of available rentals, particularly in the coastal areas, and higher prices during the peak season. However, for those looking to rent long-term, there are still many affordable options available, particularly outside of the city center. It's worth noting that the cost of living in Montenegro is generally lower than in many other European countries, making it an attractive option for expats and digital nomads.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$450 | typical quality, 40-60 sqm |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $400-$700 | family size, 80-100 sqm |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,400 | $600-$1,000 | spacious, 120-150 sqm |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$3,500 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | residential areas, older buildings |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,000 | countryside, traditional houses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Stara Varos, a historic neighborhood in the heart of Podgorica, with typical rent range $400-$700 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its charming streets and lively atmosphere\n- Nova Varos, a modern neighborhood with many new buildings and amenities, with typical rent range $500-$900 per month for a two-bedroom apartment, popular with families and expats\n- Donja Gorica, a suburban neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, with typical rent range $300-$600 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, offering a more laid-back atmosphere\n- Bijela, a coastal town near Herceg Novi, with typical rent range $250-$500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, popular with those looking for a relaxed, seaside lifestyle\n- Tološi, a neighborhood in the north of Podgorica, with typical rent range $200-$400 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Montenegro [/SECTION]\n- Start your search early, as the rental market can be competitive, especially in the city center\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and utilities, as this is a common practice in Montenegro\n- Be aware of scams, such as fake listings or unscrupulous landlords, and always inspect the property before signing a lease\n- Utilities are usually not included in the rent, so factor this into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished ones, but can be found, especially in the city center\n- Consider working with a real estate agent, as they can help you find a property that meets your needs and budget, and navigate the local rental market.",
