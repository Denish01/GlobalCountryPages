Montenegro has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed tourism industry, which drives up prices for accommodation, food, and other services. In contrast, Kosovo has a lower GDP per capita and a more limited economy, resulting in lower prices for most goods and services. Overall, Kosovo is generally cheaper than Montenegro, with a cost of living difference of around 20-30% for most expenses.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. Montenegro has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on tourism, manufacturing, and services, while Kosovo's economy is primarily driven by agriculture and remittances from abroad. This difference in economic structure contributes to the variation in prices between the two countries. Additionally, Montenegro's proximity to Western Europe and its aspirations to join the European Union have led to increased investment and economic activity, which has driven up prices in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montenegro (USD) | Kosovo (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 250 | 37.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 150 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 700 | 450 | 35.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montenegro (USD) | Kosovo (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 200 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 2 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montenegro (USD) | Kosovo (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 20 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.5 | 1 | 33.3% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1.1 | 8.3% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Montenegro (USD) | Kosovo (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 80 | 20% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 25 | 16.7% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Montenegro (USD) | Kosovo (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 550 | 31.3% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 900 | 25% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,500 | 25% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Montenegro is cheaper for:**\n- High-end accommodation and luxury services\n- Access to Western European markets and trade\n- A more developed tourism infrastructure\n- A wider range of cultural and entertainment options\n- **Kosovo is cheaper for:**\n- Basic groceries and food staples\n- Public transportation and fuel\n- Utilities and internet services\n- Rent and housing outside of city centers\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Kosovo offers better value for money, with lower prices for most goods and services.
