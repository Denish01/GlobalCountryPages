Primary education, also known as **osnovno obrazovanje**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 14 and lasts for eight years. Secondary education, or **srednje obrazovanje**, is also compulsory and lasts for four years, after which students can choose to attend vocational schools or **gimnazija**, a type of high school that prepares students for university. Tertiary education, or **visoko obrazovanje**, is provided by universities and colleges, with the University of Montenegro being the largest and most prestigious institution in the country.\n\nThe quality of education in Montenegro is generally good, with a strong emphasis on **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** subjects. However, there are some challenges facing the education system, including a lack of resources and outdated infrastructure in some schools. Public education is free and available to all citizens, while private schools and international schools offer alternative options for those who can afford them.\n\nThe education system in Montenegro is also influenced by the country's **Bologna Process** membership, which aims to create a European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and promote student mobility and academic exchange.
