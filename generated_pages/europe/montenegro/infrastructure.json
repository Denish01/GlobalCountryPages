  "content": "Montenegro's infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped compared to other European countries, but the country has made significant investments in recent years to improve its roads, energy, and telecommunications networks.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 70%\nRoad Network: 5,277 km, moderate quality\nRail Network: 250 km\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMontenegro's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a mix of old and new systems. The country has invested heavily in recent years to improve its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy facilities. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The government has prioritized infrastructure development as a key area for investment, with a focus on improving connectivity and promoting economic growth.\n\nThe country's infrastructure has been impacted by its complex geography, with many mountainous regions making it difficult to build and maintain roads and other infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Montenegro has made significant progress in recent years, with the completion of several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of a new highway connecting the capital city Podgorica to the coastal town of Bar.\n\nMontenegro's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its integration with the European Union, with the country working to align its infrastructure standards with those of the EU. This has involved significant investments in areas such as energy and transportation, as well as efforts to improve the country's environmental and social sustainability.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 5,277 km | Moderate | Many rural roads are unpaved or in poor condition |\n| Railways | 250 km | Poor | Limited rail network, mostly used for freight |\n| Airports | 2 international, 2 domestic | Good | Both international airports are located in Podgorica and Tivat |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | The port of Bar is the largest, with significant cargo and passenger traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Montenegro's power generation is primarily based on **hydroelectric power**, with several major dams along the country's rivers.\n- The country has also invested in **renewable energy sources**, including wind and solar power, with several new facilities under construction.\n- Electricity reliability is generally good, with few outages or disruptions to service.\n- However, the country's energy infrastructure is still relatively underdeveloped, with a need for significant investment to improve efficiency and reduce losses.\n- Montenegro is also working to improve its **energy efficiency**, with a focus on reducing consumption and promoting sustainable energy practices.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Tap water is generally **safe to drink** in urban areas, but may be of lower quality in rural areas.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with most households having access to **modern sanitation facilities**.\n- However, there are still significant challenges in rural areas, where many communities lack access to reliable water and sanitation services.\n- The government has invested in several major **water supply projects**, including the construction of new water treatment plants and distribution systems.\n- Montenegro is also working to improve its **wastewater management**, with a focus on reducing pollution and protecting the country's natural resources.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile coverage is generally good, with most areas having access to **3G or 4G networks**.\n- Fiber-optic broadband is available in many urban areas, with several major **internet service providers** operating in the country.\n- Montenegro has also invested in **postal services**, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services throughout the country.\n- The government has prioritized the development of **information and communication technologies**, with a focus on promoting economic growth and improving public services.\n- Several major **telecommunications companies** operate in Montenegro, including Crnogorski Telekom and Telenor.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched several major **infrastructure development projects**, including the construction of a new highway connecting Podgorica to the coastal town of Ulcinj.\n- Montenegro is also investing in **renewable energy**, with several new wind and solar power facilities under construction.\n- The country has received significant **funding from international organizations**, including the European Union and the World Bank, to support its infrastructure development efforts.\n- Several major **private sector companies** are also investing in Montenegro's infrastructure, including telecommunications and energy companies.\n- The government has established a **public-private partnership** framework to support infrastructure development, with a focus on promoting collaboration between the public and private sectors.",
