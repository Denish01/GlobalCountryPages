[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Montenegro's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a mix of old and new systems. The country has invested heavily in recent years to improve its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy facilities. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The government has prioritized infrastructure development as a key area for investment, with a focus on improving connectivity and promoting economic growth.

The country's infrastructure has been impacted by its complex geography, with many mountainous regions making it difficult to build and maintain roads and other infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Montenegro has made significant progress in recent years, with the completion of several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of a new highway connecting the capital city Podgorica to the coastal town of Bar.

Montenegro's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its integration with the European Union, with the country working to align its infrastructure standards with those of the EU. This has involved significant investments in areas such as energy and transportation, as well as efforts to improve the country's environmental and social sustainability.
