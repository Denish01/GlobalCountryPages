[SECTION] Overview: Montenegro vs Serbia [/SECTION]
Montenegro and Serbia are two neighboring countries in the Balkan region, each with its unique culture, history, and economic context. Montenegro has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed tourist industry, which contributes to its higher cost of living.
