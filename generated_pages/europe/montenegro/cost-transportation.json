The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services connecting major cities and towns. Most people in Montenegro get around by using public buses or minivans, which are affordable and convenient. However, the country's mountainous terrain can make road travel challenging, especially during winter months. The capital city, Podgorica, has a comprehensive bus network, while other cities like Kotor and Budva rely on a combination of buses and taxis.\n\nThe country's scenic coastline and picturesque towns make it a popular destination for tourists, and many visitors choose to explore Montenegro by car or on foot. The roads in Montenegro are generally in good condition, but driving can be challenging due to the country's rugged terrain and narrow roads. Alternatively, visitors can use taxis or ride-hailing services, which are widely available in major cities. With a GDP per capita PPP of $34,807 (2024) and an inflation rate of 3.3% (2024), Montenegro offers a relatively affordable transportation system compared to other European countries.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-1.00 | $20-30 | Good coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-2 | N/A | Frequent services on main routes |\n| Commuter Train | $2-5 | $50-70 | Limited services, mainly connecting Podgorica to nearby towns |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-2 | $0.50-1.00 | $5-10 | Widely available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1-2 | $0.30-0.60 | $3-6 | Bolt and TaxiPodgorica are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-30 | To Podgorica city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.30-1.50 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20-1.40 | Prices vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-50 | Economy car, prices vary depending on location and season |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Prices vary depending on location and time of day |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-5 | Limited toll roads, mainly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Frequent services connecting major cities |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | Limited domestic flights, mainly connecting Podgorica to Tivat |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-50 | Limited services, mainly connecting Podgorica to nearby countries |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or using ride-hailing services.\n- Download the Bolt or TaxiPodgorica app to book taxis or ride-hailing services in advance.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or tourist hotspots.\n- When using taxis, make sure to agree on the fare before starting your journey or insist on using the meter.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or exploring the countryside, but be aware of the country's challenging road conditions.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to ensure a safe and enjoyable journey.",
