[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Montenegro has a mixed healthcare system, combining elements of both public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with modern medical facilities and well-trained medical staff. However, it can be slow and bureaucratic, with long waiting times for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers more prompt and specialized care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the first point of contact, with private healthcare being used to supplement or speed up treatment. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers more English-speaking staff and a more streamlined service.

The healthcare system in Montenegro is generally well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific facility. In general, the larger cities such as Podgorica and Kotor tend to have better-equipped and more modern medical facilities, while smaller towns and rural areas may have more limited resources. It is generally recommended that foreigners and expats have some form of health insurance, as this can help to cover the cost of private healthcare and provide access to a wider range of medical services.

This can help to prevent accidents and injuries, and can also provide valuable skills in the event of an emergency. Additionally, it is recommended to research local medical facilities and emergency services before traveling, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. This can help to ensure that you receive the best possible care, and can also provide peace of mind while traveling in a foreign country.
