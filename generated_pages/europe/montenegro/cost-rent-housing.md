[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Montenegro is relatively small, but it has been growing in recent years, particularly in the coastal areas and the capital city of Podgorica. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a two-month deposit required, which is usually refundable at the end of the lease. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with the landlord required to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, Montenegro's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Croatia but higher than in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Serbia.

The housing market in Montenegro is also influenced by the country's tourism industry, with many apartments and houses being rented out to tourists during the summer months. This can lead to a shortage of available rentals, particularly in the coastal areas, and higher prices during the peak season. However, for those looking to rent long-term, there are still many affordable options available, particularly outside of the city center. It's worth noting that the cost of living in Montenegro is generally lower than in many other European countries, making it an attractive option for expats and digital nomads.
