        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The history of Monaco dates back to the 6th century BC, when the <strong>Phoenicians</strong> established a settlement on the site. The <strong>Greeks</strong> later took control, followed by the <strong>Romans</strong>. In 1215, the <strong>Genoese</strong> built a fortress on the rock, which would eventually become the foundation of the modern city. The <strong>Grimaldi</strong> family, who still rule Monaco today, first arrived in 1297. Over the centuries, Monaco's strategic location made it a prized possession, with various European powers vying for control. In 1861, Monaco became a <strong>sovereign state</strong>, with Charles III as its ruler. The country's independence was formally recognized by France in 1861, and it has since maintained a close relationship with its larger neighbor.</p>
        <p>Monaco's history is also marked by its <strong>treaty of protection</strong> with France, signed in 1861. This treaty established France as the protector of Monaco's independence and sovereignty. In 1911, Monaco adopted a <strong>constitution</strong>, which established the country as a <strong>constitutional monarchy</strong>. The constitution has been amended several times since then, with the most recent revision taking place in 2002. Today, Monaco is a <strong>sovereign city-state</strong>, with its own government, economy, and culture.</p>
        <p>Monaco's economy has historically been driven by <strong>tourism</strong> and <strong>casinos</strong>, which were introduced in the mid-19th century. The country's mild climate, beautiful scenery, and luxurious amenities have made it a popular destination for wealthy visitors. In the 20th century, Monaco also developed a <strong>financial sector</strong>, with many banks and financial institutions establishing operations in the country. Today, Monaco is a major <strong>financial center</strong>, with a strong emphasis on <strong>private banking</strong> and <strong>asset management</strong>.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Monaco has taken steps to <strong>diversify its economy</strong>, with a focus on <strong>sustainable development</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong>. The country has invested in <strong>renewable energy</strong> and <strong>green technologies</strong>, and has implemented measures to reduce its <strong>carbon footprint</strong>. Monaco has also become a hub for <strong>startups</strong> and <strong>entrepreneurs</strong>, with a number of incubators and accelerators operating in the country.</p>
