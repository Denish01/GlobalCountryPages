[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Monaco does not have a commercial airport within its territory, but the nearest international airport is the Nice Côte d'Azur Airport (NCE) in France, which is about 30 kilometers away from Monaco. This airport offers direct flights to numerous European cities, as well as connections to destinations worldwide. From Nice Airport, you can take a taxi, bus, or train to reach Monaco. The overland entry points into Monaco are primarily from France, with the A8 highway connecting Nice to Monaco and several bus services operating between the two destinations.

For those traveling from other parts of Europe or internationally, flying into Nice Airport and then taking a connecting mode of transportation to Monaco is the most common approach. There are also helicopter services available from Nice Airport to Monaco, offering a more luxurious and scenic entry into the principality. Additionally, for those coming from nearby Italian cities or other parts of France, driving or taking the train can be convenient options, given Monaco's well-connected rail network and its proximity to major European cities.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Since Monaco does not have a domestic air network in the traditional sense, due to its small size, there are no domestic flights within the principality. However, for travel to other parts of France or Europe, flights from Nice Côte d'Azur Airport are readily available. Booking in advance can help secure better rates, and considering budget airlines can be a cost-effective way to travel to nearby destinations. Approximate costs for flights from Nice to other European cities can vary widely, depending on the destination, time of year, and how far in advance you book.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Monaco has a moderate rail network, with the Monaco-Monte-Carlo station being the primary rail hub. This station is part of the SNCF (Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français) network, offering connections to major French cities like Paris and Marseille, as well as international destinations. The train journey from Nice to Monaco is particularly popular and convenient, taking about 20 minutes. High-speed trains (TGV) are available for longer journeys, such as to Paris. Booking train tickets can be done online through the SNCF website or at the train station itself, and it's advisable to book in advance for the best prices, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Several bus companies operate in and around Monaco, providing intercity connections to nearby cities in France and Italy. The Compagnie des Autobus de Monaco (CAM) is the main bus operator within Monaco, offering routes that cover the entire principality. For travel to and from Nice, the Nice Airport Express bus service is a convenient option. Costs for bus travel are generally lower than train tickets, making it a budget-friendly option for shorter distances. The quality of the buses is good, with most services being modern and comfortable.
