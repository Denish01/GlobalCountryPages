[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Monaco is highly competitive, with a limited supply of properties available for rent. Typical lease terms are for one to three years, and tenants are usually required to pay a deposit of two to three months' rent. Tenant rights in Monaco are protected by law, and tenants have the right to renew their lease at the end of the contract. However, the high demand for housing in Monaco means that rents are often very high, and the market is heavily biased in favor of landlords. Compared to its regional neighbors, Monaco's housing costs are among the highest in Europe, with prices similar to those found in major cities like Paris or London.

The high cost of housing in Monaco is due to the principality's unique combination of limited space, high demand, and **low taxation**. The government has implemented various measures to try to control the housing market, including rent controls and subsidies for low-income tenants. However, these measures have had limited success, and the housing market in Monaco remains highly competitive and expensive. For example, the **Monaco government** has introduced a scheme to provide subsidized housing for low-income residents, but the demand for these properties far exceeds the available supply.
