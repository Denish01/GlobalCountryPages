[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Monaco has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system in Monaco is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and experienced medical professionals. However, the system can be quite expensive, and many locals and foreigners choose to opt for private health insurance to cover the costs of medical treatment. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally more affordable, with many medical services being subsidized by the government. For foreigners, however, the cost of medical treatment can be quite high, and it is often recommended that they purchase private health insurance to cover the costs of medical treatment.

The healthcare system in Monaco is designed to provide comprehensive medical coverage to all residents, regardless of their income or social status. The system is funded through a combination of government subsidies, social security contributions, and private health insurance premiums. While the public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, there can be long waiting times for certain medical procedures, which is why many people choose to opt for private healthcare options. Private healthcare providers in Monaco offer a range of medical services, including specialist consultations, surgical procedures, and hospital stays, and are often preferred by foreigners and those who can afford the higher costs.
