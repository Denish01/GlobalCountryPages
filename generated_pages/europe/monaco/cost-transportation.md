[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Monaco has a well-developed public transportation system, with an extensive network of buses that cover most areas of the city-state. The quality of public transit is high, with frequent and reliable services. Most people in Monaco get around using the public bus system, which is efficient and affordable. However, due to the city-state's small size, many residents also prefer to walk or cycle, taking advantage of the scenic views and pleasant climate.

The main transportation modes in Monaco include buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The city-state's compact size means that most destinations are within walking distance, but public transportation is still a convenient option for those who prefer not to walk. The public bus system is operated by the Compagnie des Autobus de Monaco (CAM), which offers a range of routes and frequencies. Taxis are also widely available, but can be more expensive than public transportation.
