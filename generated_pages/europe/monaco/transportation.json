This airport offers direct flights to numerous European cities, as well as connections to destinations worldwide. From Nice Airport, you can take a taxi, bus, or train to reach Monaco. The overland entry points into Monaco are primarily from France, with the A8 highway connecting Nice to Monaco and several bus services operating between the two destinations.\n\nFor those traveling from other parts of Europe or internationally, flying into Nice Airport and then taking a connecting mode of transportation to Monaco is the most common approach. There are also helicopter services available from Nice Airport to Monaco, offering a more luxurious and scenic entry into the principality. Additionally, for those coming from nearby Italian cities or other parts of France, driving or taking the train can be convenient options, given Monaco's well-connected rail network and its proximity to major European cities.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nSince Monaco does not have a domestic air network in the traditional sense, due to its small size, there are no domestic flights within the principality. However, for travel to other parts of France or Europe, flights from Nice Côte d'Azur Airport are readily available. Booking in advance can help secure better rates, and considering budget airlines can be a cost-effective way to travel to nearby destinations.

The train journey from Nice to Monaco is particularly popular and convenient, taking about 20 minutes. High-speed trains (TGV) are available for longer journeys, such as to Paris.

The Compagnie des Autobus de Monaco (CAM) is the main bus operator within Monaco, offering routes that cover the entire principality.
