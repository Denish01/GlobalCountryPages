The quality of public transit is high, with frequent and reliable services. Most people in Monaco get around using the public bus system, which is efficient and affordable. However, due to the city-state's small size, many residents also prefer to walk or cycle, taking advantage of the scenic views and pleasant climate.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Monaco include buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The city-state's compact size means that most destinations are within walking distance, but public transportation is still a convenient option for those who prefer not to walk. The public bus system is operated by the Compagnie des Autobus de Monaco (CAM), which offers a range of routes and frequencies. Taxis are also widely available, but can be more expensive than public transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2.50 | $64 | Extensive coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Monaco |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $3.50 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly used for airport transfers |\n| Commuter Train | $10-$20 | $100-$150 | Limited services, mostly used for international connections |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $6 | $2.50 | $10-$15 | Available at taxi stands and by phone |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5 | $2 | $8-$12 | Uber and Bolt available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.80 | Unleaded, 95 octane |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.60 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-$100 | Economy car, depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $4-$6 | Limited parking spaces, fees apply |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mostly used for international connections |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | To nearby cities in France and Italy |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not applicable, Monaco has no domestic flights |\n| Train (long-distance) | $50-$100 | To major cities in Europe, depending on route and class |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use the public bus system for affordable and convenient travel within Monaco.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for frequent travel.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber and Bolt for door-to-door services.\n- Be aware of traffic congestion and limited parking spaces in the city center.\n- Negotiate taxi fares in advance, especially for longer journeys.\n- Take advantage of scenic walking routes and bike paths for a more leisurely experience.",
