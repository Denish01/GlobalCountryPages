Primary education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 11, and is provided by the government. Secondary education is also compulsory, and lasts for four years, from ages 11 to 15. Students can then choose to pursue a range of vocational or academic programs, including the **Baccalauréat**, which is a French secondary school diploma.

The majority of schools in Monaco are public, but there are also a number of private schools, including international schools, that offer alternative curricula and teaching methods.

However, private schools can be quite expensive, and may require significant financial investment. Despite this, the education system in Monaco is highly regarded, and is considered to be one of the best in the world. The country's small size and high standard of living also make it an attractive destination for international students, who can take advantage of the country's high-quality education system and unique cultural environment.

These programs are designed to provide students with the practical skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce, and are often developed in partnership with local businesses and industries. This approach has helped to make Monaco's education system highly relevant and effective, and has contributed to the country's low unemployment rate and high standard of living.
