Typical lease terms are for one to three years, and tenants are usually required to pay a deposit of two to three months' rent. Tenant rights in Monaco are protected by law, and tenants have the right to renew their lease at the end of the contract. However, the high demand for housing in Monaco means that rents are often very high, and the market is heavily biased in favor of landlords. Compared to its regional neighbors, Monaco's housing costs are among the highest in Europe, with prices similar to those found in major cities like Paris or London.\n\nThe high cost of housing in Monaco is due to the principality's unique combination of limited space, high demand, and **low taxation**. The government has implemented various measures to try to control the housing market, including rent controls and subsidies for low-income tenants. However, these measures have had limited success, and the housing market in Monaco remains highly competitive and expensive. For example, the **Monaco government** has introduced a scheme to provide subsidized housing for low-income residents, but the demand for these properties far exceeds the available supply.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $2,500 - $4,000 | $1,800 - $3,000 | (small, basic accommodation) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $3,000 - $5,000 | $2,200 - $3,800 | (modern, fully equipped) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $4,500 - $7,000 | $3,200 - $5,500 | (family size, comfortable) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $6,000 - $10,000 | $4,500 - $7,500 | (spacious, luxury) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $50,000 - $100,000 | (prime locations, luxury properties) |\n| Suburbs | $30,000 - $60,000 | (residential areas, modern properties) |\n| Rural | not applicable | (Monaco is a highly urbanized principality) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Larvotto**: a popular neighborhood with modern apartments and a range of amenities, rent range $3,000 - $6,000 per month\n- **Fontvieille**: a residential area with a mix of old and new properties, rent range $2,500 - $5,000 per month\n- **La Rousse**: a lively neighborhood with a range of restaurants and shops, rent range $2,000 - $4,000 per month\n- **Monaco-Ville**: the historic center of Monaco, with a range of old and new properties, rent range $2,500 - $5,000 per month\n- **Beausoleil**: a neighborhood located just outside the center of Monaco, with a range of modern apartments, rent range $1,800 - $3,500 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Monaco [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to find the best deals on rent and property prices\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Be prepared to act quickly, as the rental market in Monaco is highly competitive\n- Consider sharing an apartment with others to reduce costs\n- Be aware of the **tenant fees** and **deposit requirements** before signing a lease\n- Check the **utilities** and **furniture** included in the rent, as these can vary greatly between properties\n- Be cautious of **scams** and always verify the identity of the landlord or agent before signing a lease or paying any fees.",
