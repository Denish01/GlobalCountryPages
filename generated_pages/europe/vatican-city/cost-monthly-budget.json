This is one of the highest in the world, making it a challenging place to live for those on a tight budget. A budget of $1,800 per month would allow for a very basic lifestyle, with shared accommodation and limited expenses, while a mid-range budget of $2,800 per month would provide a more comfortable lifestyle, with a one-bedroom apartment in the city center and some disposable income for entertainment and travel. A comfortable lifestyle, on the other hand, would require around $3,500 per month, allowing for a nice two-bedroom apartment, regular dining out, and frequent travel.\n\nIn comparison to neighboring Italy, Vatican City is significantly more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being among the highest in the region. However, the city's unique status as an independent city-state, with a highly specialized economy and a very small population, means that the cost of living is unlikely to decrease in the near future. As a result, those considering living in Vatican City should be prepared for a high cost of living, and should carefully plan their budget and expenses accordingly.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 800 | 1,200 | 1,800 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 300 | 500 | 800 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 100 | 200 | 300 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 150 | 250 | 350 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 100 | 200 | 300 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 200 | 400 | 600 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 100 | 200 | 300 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 200 | 300 | 400 | |\n| **Total** | **1,750** | **2,750** | **3,550** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle in Vatican City would be very basic, with a shared apartment outside the city center and limited expenses for food, transportation, and entertainment.
