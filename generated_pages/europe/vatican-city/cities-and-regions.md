Vatican City is not divided into administrative regions or provinces like other countries. Instead, it is a single, unified entity with various landmarks and areas, including the Vatican Hill, the Vatican Gardens, and St. Peter's Square. The city-state is home to numerous iconic buildings and structures, such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Apostolic Palace, which serve as the residence of the Pope and the central government of the Catholic Church.

The lack of formal administrative divisions in Vatican City is due to its small size and unique status as a sovereign city-state. The entire area is governed directly by the Pope and the Pontifical Council, with various departments and offices responsible for different aspects of the city's administration, such as finance, security, and public works. Despite its small size, Vatican City has a distinct character and identity, with a strong focus on spirituality, art, and culture.
