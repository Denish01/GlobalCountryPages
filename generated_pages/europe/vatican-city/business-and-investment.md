[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
The business environment in Vatican City is highly unique and limited, with a population of less than 1,000 people, most of whom are clergy or officials of the Catholic Church. The government's attitude toward foreign investment is generally not encouraging, as the Vatican's economy is not driven by commercial activities. The bureaucracy level is relatively high, and the context of corruption is minimal, given the city-state's small size and the nature of its activities. The Vatican has a **monopoly** on certain industries, such as the production of coins, stamps, and other souvenirs, which can limit opportunities for foreign investment.

The Vatican's economy is supported mainly by the sale of **postage stamps**, **coins**, and **souvenirs**, as well as investments and donations. The city-state has a small but efficient **banking system**, with the Institute for the Works of Religion (also known as the Vatican Bank) being the main financial institution. However, the Vatican's business environment is not conducive to large-scale commercial activities, and the city-state's main focus is on its spiritual and cultural mission.

The Vatican has a highly specialized and limited labor market, with most employees being clergy or officials of the Catholic Church. The city-state has a **unique labor law** system, which is based on canon law and is not directly comparable to other countries. The Vatican also has a **highly developed social security system**, which provides comprehensive benefits to its employees.
