The city-state is entirely urban, with all residents living in a densely populated area.

The population is predominantly male, with a small number of nuns and other female support staff.\n\nThe population size of Vatican City is so small that it is often not included in general population statistics, but it is still a significant entity due to its unique status as a sovereign city-state. The lack of natural population growth, due to the absence of families and children, means that the population is maintained through the appointment of new residents. The city-state's urbanization is complete, with no rural areas, and the population density is extremely high due to the limited land area.\n\nThe overall population overview of Vatican City is characterized by its small, stagnant, and highly specialized population, with a unique set of demographic characteristics that set it apart from other countries. The city-state's population is essentially a self-contained community, with its own distinct culture and way of life.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Italian | 70% | Europe | Primary language and culture |\n| Swiss | 20% | Europe | Swiss Guards and support staff |\n| German | 5% | Europe | Some clergy and support staff |\n| Other European | 3% | Europe | Various clergy and support staff |\n| Other | 2% | Worldwide | Small number of non-European residents |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic groups in Vatican City are predominantly European, with Italians making up the largest percentage, followed by Swiss and other European nationals.
