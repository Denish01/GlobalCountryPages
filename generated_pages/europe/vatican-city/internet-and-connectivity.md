The internet in Vatican City is known for its reliability and speed, with an average internet speed of 20 Mbps download. As the city-state is completely surrounded by Rome, Italy, it benefits from the country's well-developed telecommunications infrastructure. The urban area of Vatican City has excellent mobile network coverage, with all major Italian carriers offering their services within the city. However, due to its small size, there is no rural area to speak of, and the internet quality remains consistent throughout.

The internet in Vatican City is generally very reliable, with minimal downtime and fast connection speeds. This makes it an ideal location for remote workers and travelers who need to stay connected. The city's small size and high population density also mean that WiFi signals are often strong and available throughout the city. With the availability of 5G networks, visitors can enjoy even faster internet speeds, making it easier to stream videos, make video calls, and stay connected with family and friends back home.
