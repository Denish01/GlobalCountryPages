Despite their small size, they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Vatican City, being a sovereign city-state, has a unique economy that is supported by the sale of postage stamps, coins, and souvenirs, as well as investments and donations. Monaco, on the other hand, is a principality with a strong economy driven by tourism, banking, and finance. The cost of living in Monaco is generally higher due to its popularity among tourists and wealthy individuals, while Vatican City's cost of living is relatively lower due to its smaller size and more limited economy.\n\nThe economic context of these two countries has a significant impact on their cost of living. Vatican City's economy is relatively isolated, with a limited number of residents and a unique system of governance. Monaco, on the other hand, is a popular destination for tourists and wealthy individuals, which drives up the cost of living. Overall, Vatican City is generally cheaper than Monaco, with an overall cost of living that is approximately 30-40% lower.
