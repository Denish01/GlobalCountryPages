The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, but it is primarily reserved for citizens and residents of Vatican City. Foreigners, on the other hand, are often directed to private healthcare providers, which can be more expensive. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with locals having access to public healthcare services and foreigners typically requiring private insurance or paying out-of-pocket for medical expenses.
