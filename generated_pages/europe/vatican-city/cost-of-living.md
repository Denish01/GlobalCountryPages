[SECTION] How Expensive Is Vatican City? [/SECTION]
Vatican City is one of the most expensive destinations in the world, with prices comparable to or even higher than those in major Western European cities. The city-state's unique status, limited size, and high demand from tourists and pilgrims contribute to its expensive cost of living. Compared to its neighbor, Italy, Vatican City is significantly more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodation and food. However, visitors can still find ways to experience the city's rich history, art, and culture without breaking the bank.

The high cost of living in Vatican City is also due to its limited economy, which is supported mainly by the sale of postage stamps, coins, and souvenirs, as well as investments and donations. The city-state has a unique economic system, with no income tax and a limited number of residents, which contributes to its high cost of living. Despite the high prices, Vatican City remains a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims, with over 6 million visitors per year.
