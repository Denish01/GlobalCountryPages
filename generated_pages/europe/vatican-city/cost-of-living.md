[SECTION] How Expensive Is Vatican City? [/SECTION]
Vatican City is one of the most expensive destinations in the world, with prices comparable to or even higher than those in major European cities like Rome or Paris. The city-state's limited size and unique status contribute to the high cost of living and visiting. As a result, travelers and residents alike can expect to pay premium prices for accommodations, food, and other services. Compared to its neighbor, Italy, Vatican City is significantly more expensive, especially when it comes to accommodations and dining.

The high cost of living in Vatican City is also due to the fact that the city-state has a very limited workforce and most goods and services are imported from Italy, which increases their cost.

Overall, Vatican City is a destination that requires careful budgeting and planning to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
