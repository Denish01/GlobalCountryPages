Vatican City has a unique population size, with only a few hundred residents, and its growth trends are essentially stagnant due to the limited number of people allowed to live within its walls. The city-state is entirely urban, with all residents living in a densely populated area. Migration patterns are also distinct, as new residents are typically appointed or assigned to positions within the Vatican, such as clergy or Swiss Guards. The population is predominantly male, with a small number of nuns and other female support staff.

The population size of Vatican City is so small that it is often not included in general population statistics, but it is still a significant entity due to its unique status as a sovereign city-state. The lack of natural population growth, due to the absence of families and children, means that the population is maintained through the appointment of new residents. The city-state's urbanization is complete, with no rural areas, and the population density is extremely high due to the limited land area.

The overall population overview of Vatican City is characterized by its small, stagnant, and highly specialized population, with a unique set of demographic characteristics that set it apart from other countries.
