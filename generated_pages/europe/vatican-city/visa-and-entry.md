[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Vatican City has a relatively liberal visa policy, with citizens of many countries being allowed to enter the city without a visa. The city-state is completely surrounded by Rome, Italy, and as such, visitors can enter Vatican City from Italy without going through a traditional border control. The Vatican City authorities do not issue visas, and travelers who require a visa to enter Italy will also need to meet Italy's visa requirements to visit Vatican City. Since Vatican City is a small city-state with limited infrastructure, it does not have a traditional immigration system, and visitors are generally allowed to enter the city for short periods.

The visa policy of Vatican City is closely tied to that of Italy, and as such, citizens of countries that do not require a visa to enter Italy can also visit Vatican City without a visa. This includes citizens of the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, and many other countries. However, it is essential to note that visitors must still meet certain requirements, such as holding a valid passport and proof of onward travel, to enter Vatican City.
