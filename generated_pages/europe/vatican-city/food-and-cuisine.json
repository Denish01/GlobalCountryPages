The city's unique location, nestled within Rome, has allowed it to adopt many of the Italian capital's culinary customs, including a love of pasta, pizza, and gelato. However, Vatican City's cuisine has also been shaped by its Catholic heritage, with many dishes featuring ingredients such as fish and seafood, which are commonly consumed on Fridays and other days of abstinence.\n\nThe city's culinary scene is also influenced by its many international residents and visitors, who have introduced a variety of global flavors and ingredients to the local cuisine. Despite its small size, Vatican City is home to a surprising number of restaurants, cafes, and food shops, many of which offer a range of traditional Italian dishes, as well as more modern and innovative creations. From **Tortellini** to **Risotto**, Vatican City's cuisine is a true reflection of its rich history and cultural diversity.\n\nVatican City's food culture is also closely tied to its many festivals and celebrations, which often feature traditional dishes and ingredients. For example, the **Festa di San Pietro** (Feast of St. Peter) is celebrated with a traditional dish called **Baccala**, which is made with dried cod, tomatoes, and olive oil.
