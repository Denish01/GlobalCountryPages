[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Vatican City has a **territorial taxation** system, where only income earned within the city-state is subject to tax. However, this applies mainly to employees of the Holy See and certain Vatican City-based entities. For most individuals, including expats, the taxation system is based on **residency**, where individuals who reside in Vatican City for more than 183 days in a calendar year are considered tax residents. Tax residency rules are based on the individual's physical presence in the city-state, and not on their citizenship or nationality.

The tax system in Vatican City is relatively simple, with a focus on **indirect taxation**, such as value-added tax (VAT) and customs duties. The city-state has a limited number of tax treaties, with only one treaty in place with Italy, which can lead to **double taxation** issues for individuals and businesses with connections to other countries. However, the Vatican City tax authorities may provide relief from double taxation in certain cases, based on the specific circumstances of the individual or business.
