In comparison to neighboring Italy, Vatican City is significantly more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being among the highest in the region. However, the city's unique status as an independent city-state, with a highly specialized economy and a very small population, means that the cost of living is unlikely to decrease in the near future. As a result, those considering living in Vatican City should be prepared for a high cost of living, and should carefully plan their budget and expenses accordingly.
