[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Vatican City is highly competitive and limited, with most properties being owned by the Catholic Church or the Vatican City government. Typical lease terms are for one to three years, with a deposit requirement of two to three months' rent. Tenant rights are relatively limited, and renters should be prepared to negotiate terms carefully. Compared to its regional neighbors, Vatican City's housing costs are significantly higher, even compared to Rome, the capital of Italy, which surrounds Vatican City.

The housing market in Vatican City is also heavily influenced by the city-state's unique status and the high demand for housing from clergy, diplomats, and other officials. As a result, housing prices and rents are extremely high, and the market is highly competitive. Additionally, the city-state's limited size and lack of new construction projects mean that the supply of housing is very limited, driving up prices and rents even further.
