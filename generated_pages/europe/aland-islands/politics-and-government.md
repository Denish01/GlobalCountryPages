[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Aland Islands have a unique political system that combines elements of autonomy and regional representation. The territory has its own government, known as the **Landskapsregering**, which is headed by the Premier of Aland. The Premier is responsible for overseeing the administration of the territory and representing the interests of the Aland Islands in Finland and internationally. The Aland Islands also have their own legislature, known as the **Lagting**, which is a unicameral assembly with 30 seats. The Lagting is responsible for passing laws and approving the budget for the territory.

The political system of the Aland Islands is based on the principles of **democracy** and **self-governance**. The territory has a high degree of autonomy, with the power to make its own laws and decisions on a wide range of issues, including education, healthcare, and transportation. However, the Aland Islands are still part of Finland and are subject to Finnish law in certain areas, such as defense and foreign policy.

The separation of powers in the Aland Islands is similar to that in Finland, with a clear distinction between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. The Premier and the Landskapsregering are responsible for the executive branch, while the Lagting is responsible for the legislative branch. The judicial branch is composed of the **Aland Court of Appeal** and the **Supreme Court of Finland**, which have jurisdiction over the territory.
