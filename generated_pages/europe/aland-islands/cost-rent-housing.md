[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Aland Islands is relatively stable, with a mix of old and new buildings available for rent. Typical lease terms are for one to two years, and deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and tenants are entitled to a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the rental agreement. Compared to its regional neighbors, Finland and Sweden, Aland Islands' housing costs are relatively moderate. However, the islands' remote location and limited supply of housing can drive up prices, especially in the capital city of Mariehamn.

The housing market in Aland Islands is also influenced by the islands' unique cultural and linguistic heritage. The majority of the population speaks Swedish, and many residents have strong ties to the Swedish mainland. As a result, the housing market is closely linked to the Swedish market, and prices can be influenced by trends and developments in Sweden. Despite this, the Aland Islands' housing market remains relatively distinct, with its own unique characteristics and challenges.
