  "content": "The Aland Islands are often misunderstood as simply a Swedish-speaking region of Finland, but the reality is that they have a unique history, culture, and autonomy that sets them apart from the rest of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nThe Aland Islands have a long and complex history, with the first inhabitants arriving around 4000 BC. The islands were part of the Swedish kingdom from the 12th century until 1809, when they were ceded to Russia along with the rest of Finland. In 1917, Finland declared its independence from Russia, and the Aland Islands were included in the new Finnish state. However, the islands' Swedish-speaking population sought autonomy, and in 1921, the League of Nations granted the Aland Islands a high degree of autonomy within Finland. This autonomy has been maintained to this day, with the Aland Islands having their own parliament, flag, and official language, **Swedish**.\n\nThe Aland Islands' autonomy is based on the **Aland Islands' Autonomy Act**, which was passed by the Finnish parliament in 1920 and revised in 1991.
