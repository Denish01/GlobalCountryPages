  "content": "To get around in Aland Islands, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, and ferries, as well as drive or bike, given the territory's limited but well-maintained infrastructure and stunning natural scenery.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Mariehamn Airport (MHQ)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe Aland Islands are situated in the Baltic Sea, midway between Finland and Sweden, making them easily accessible by air or sea. The main airport, Mariehamn Airport (MHQ), receives direct flights from Helsinki, Finland, and Stockholm, Sweden, with connecting flights to other European cities. For those traveling by sea, ferry services connect the Aland Islands to both Finland and Sweden, with the most popular routes being from Turku, Finland, and Kapellskar, Sweden.\n\nTravelers can also enter the Aland Islands overland from Finland via the ferry from Turku or by taking a flight from Helsinki to Mariehamn Airport. There are no direct land borders with Sweden, but ferries provide a convenient alternative. Visitors should note that while the Aland Islands are part of Finland, they have a special autonomous status, which includes their own customs and tax regulations. This means that there might be restrictions on certain goods when traveling to or from the islands, especially for non-EU citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThe domestic air network in the Aland Islands is limited, with most flights connecting Mariehamn to other parts of Finland. The main airline operating within the region is Finnair, which offers flights from Mariehamn to Helsinki. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons. The cost of domestic flights can vary, but approximate costs range from $50 to $200 for a one-way ticket, depending on the time of booking and the season.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThere is no rail network in the Aland Islands, making trains an unavailable option for getting around the territory. This is due to the islands' geographical location and historical development, which have relied more on sea and air transportation. As a result, visitors must rely on other modes of transportation such as buses, taxis, or driving.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThe Aland Islands have a moderate network of buses that connect the main towns and villages. The buses are operated by Ålandsbuss, which offers routes that cover most of the inhabited areas of the islands. The quality of the buses is good, with comfortable seating and regular schedules. The cost of bus travel is relatively affordable, with a single ticket costing around $5 to $10, depending on the distance. It's possible to buy tickets on the bus or at designated ticket offices, and some routes may offer discounts for advance bookings or for holders of a tourist card.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | - | - | Not available |\n| City Bus | Mariehamn | $2-$5 | Regular schedules |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $2-$5/km | Available by phone or at taxi stands |\n| Ride-Hailing | Mariehamn | $5-$10 | Local apps available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | - | - | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in the Aland Islands, you need a valid **driver's license** from your home country or an international driving permit, depending on your nationality and the length of your stay.\n- The **road conditions** are generally good, with well-maintained roads connecting the main towns and villages.\n- **Fuel costs** are somewhat higher than in mainland Finland due to transportation costs, but they remain comparable to other parts of Europe.\n- For **car rental**, it's advisable to book in advance, especially during peak season, as options may be limited.
