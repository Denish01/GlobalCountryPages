  "content": "The population of Poland is predominantly composed of ethnic Poles, with a significant majority practicing Roman Catholicism, and a mix of urban and rural dwellers, with a steadily declining population growth rate. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 37.7 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: -0.5%\nMedian Age: 41.7 years\nUrban Population: 60.3%\nPopulation Density: 120 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 77.3 years\nFertility Rate: 1.4 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nPoland's population has been steadily declining over the past few decades, with a negative growth rate of approximately -0.5% per annum. This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including low fertility rates, an aging population, and migration to other European countries. The country's population is projected to continue declining, with estimates suggesting a reduction of around 10% by 2050. In terms of urbanization, around 60% of the population resides in urban areas, with the majority concentrated in the largest cities, including Warsaw, Krakow, and Gdansk. Poland's population is also characterized by a relatively high median age, with around 41.7% of the population aged between 25 and 54.\n\nThe population decline in Poland has significant implications for the country's economy, social security system, and healthcare services. To mitigate these effects, the Polish government has implemented various policies aimed at increasing fertility rates, encouraging migration, and promoting urban development. Despite these challenges, Poland remains one of the most populous countries in the European Union, with a rich cultural heritage and a strong sense of national identity. The country's population is also becoming increasingly diverse, with a growing number of immigrants and expatriates contributing to the country's economic and social development.\n\nPoland's population trends are also influenced by migration patterns, with many young and educated Poles moving to other European countries in search of better job opportunities. This brain drain has significant implications for Poland's economy and social development, as it can lead to a shortage of skilled workers and a loss of talent. However, the Polish government has implemented various initiatives aimed at encouraging migration and promoting the return of Polish citizens who have lived abroad.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Polish | 96.9% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Silesian | 1.1% | Silesia | Recognized as a regional language |\n| Kashubian | 0.5% | Pomerania | Distinct cultural and linguistic group |\n| German | 0.4% | Western Poland | Minority group with historical ties to Germany |\n| Ukrainian | 0.2% | Eastern Poland | Minority group with historical ties to Ukraine |\n| Belarusian | 0.1% | Eastern Poland | Minority group with historical ties to Belarus |\n| Romani | 0.1% | Nationwide | Minority group with a distinct culture and language |\n[/TABLE]\nEthnic relations in Poland are generally harmonious, with the majority of the population identifying as ethnic Poles.
