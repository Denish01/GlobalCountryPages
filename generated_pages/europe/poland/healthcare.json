The system is divided into public and private sectors, with public healthcare providers being the primary source of care for most people. The quality of care in Poland is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment, particularly in urban areas. However, there can be some variations in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having more limited access to specialized medical services.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Poland is generally well-organized, with a wide range of medical services available, including doctor's visits, hospital stays, and access to medications.
