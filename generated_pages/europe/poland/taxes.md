[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Poland operates a **territorial taxation** system, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are taxed only on their Polish-source income. To be considered a tax resident in Poland, an individual must have a **permanent home** or **center of vital interests** in the country, or spend more than 183 days in Poland in a given tax year. The tax authorities also consider other factors, such as the location of an individual's family, business, and assets, when determining tax residency.

Poland's tax system is overseen by the **Ministry of Finance**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing guidance to taxpayers. The tax year in Poland runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of April of the following year. Poland has a well-developed tax treaty network, with over 90 countries, which helps to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion.
