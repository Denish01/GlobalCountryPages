[SECTION] Overview: Poland vs Russia [/SECTION]
Poland and Russia are two countries with distinct economic profiles, which influence their cost of living. Poland, a member of the European Union, has a more integrated economy with a strong service sector, while Russia's economy is heavily reliant on natural resources. The cost of living in Poland is generally lower than in Russia, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more affordable.

However, the inflation rate in Poland is lower, which means that prices are more stable, making it easier to plan expenses.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living.

As a result, Poland's economy is more stable, which contributes to a lower cost of living.
