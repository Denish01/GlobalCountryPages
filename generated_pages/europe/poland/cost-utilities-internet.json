  "content": "The average cost of utilities and internet in Poland can range from $150 to $300 per month for a medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and provider.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($25 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: PLN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nPoland has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with most apartments and houses connected to the national grid for electricity, water, and gas. However, utility costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased heating demands. The quality of the utility infrastructure is generally good, with reliable supply and minimal outages. The costs of utilities are also subject to change due to inflation, which was 3.8% in 2024, but overall, Poland's utility costs are considered relatively stable compared to other European countries.\n\nThe seasonal variation in utility costs is mainly due to the heating demands during the winter months. Apartments and houses in Poland often use gas or electricity for heating, which can lead to higher bills during the colder months. However, some utility providers offer fixed-rate plans or discounts for long-term contracts, which can help mitigate the impact of seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, many Polish households are adopting energy-efficient measures, such as insulation and double-glazed windows, to reduce their energy consumption and lower their utility bills.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $30 | $50 | $80 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$110** | **$175** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-25 | 30 Mbps | T-Mobile, Orange |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-50 | 100 Mbps | T-Mobile, Orange |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 5 GB | Play, Plus |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 10 GB | T-Mobile, Orange |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-60 | varies | T-Mobile, Orange |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Poland, it's best to contact the local utility providers directly, such as Tauron or PGE, to arrange for connections and contracts.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available in Poland, but postpaid plans are more common and often offer better rates.\n- The best internet providers in Poland include T-Mobile, Orange, and Play, which offer fast and reliable connections.\n- To save on utility bills, consider adopting energy-efficient measures, such as using LED light bulbs and turning off appliances when not in use.\n- It's also a good idea to compare prices and plans from different utility providers to find the best deals and discounts.",
