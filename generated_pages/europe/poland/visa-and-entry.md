# Poland Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Poland before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Poland has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. As a member of the European Union (EU) and the Schengen Area, Poland's visa policy is aligned with other EU countries. Citizens of over 60 countries can enter Poland visa-free, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. These visa-free travelers can stay in Poland for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.

The Polish government has implemented a relatively liberal visa policy to encourage tourism and business travel. However, travelers from certain countries, such as India and China, require a visa to enter Poland. The type of visa required depends on the purpose and duration of the stay. Poland also offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas.
