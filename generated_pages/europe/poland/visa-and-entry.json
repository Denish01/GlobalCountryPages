[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nPoland has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. As a member of the European Union (EU) and the Schengen Area, Poland's visa policy is aligned with other EU countries. Citizens of over 60 countries can enter Poland visa-free, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. These visa-free travelers can stay in Poland for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.\n\nThe Polish government has implemented a relatively liberal visa policy to encourage tourism and business travel. However, travelers from certain countries, such as India and China, require a visa to enter Poland. The type of visa required depends on the purpose and duration of the stay. Poland also offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | Unlimited | Can live and work in Poland |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply at a Polish embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply at a Polish embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Poland visa-free if they are citizens of eligible countries.
