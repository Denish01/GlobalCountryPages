The quality of public education is considered to be high, with Polish students consistently performing well in international rankings. The language of instruction is Polish, but many schools offer classes in foreign languages, particularly English. Compulsory education in Poland lasts for 12 years, from age 7 to 19, and is divided into primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary education. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Warsaw and Krakow, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.\n\nThe private education sector in Poland is smaller but still significant, with many private schools and universities offering high-quality education. Private schools often have smaller class sizes and more individualized attention, but can be more expensive than public schools.
