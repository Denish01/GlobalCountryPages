[SECTION] How Poland Is Divided [/SECTION]
Poland is divided into 16 voivodeships, which are the highest level of administrative division in the country. These voivodeships are further divided into 379 counties, and then into 2,478 gminas, which are the lowest level of administrative division. This system of division allows for efficient governance and management of resources across the country. The 16 voivodeships are: Greater Poland, Kuyavia-Pomerania, Lesser Poland, Łódź, Lower Silesia, Lublin, Lubusz, Masovia, Opole, Podlaskie, Pomerania, Silesia, Świętokrzyskie, Warmia-Masuria, West Pomerania, and Podkarpackie.

The division of Poland into voivodeships is based on geographical, cultural, and economic factors. Each voivodeship has its own unique character, with some being more industrialized and others being more rural. The voivodeships are also home to many of Poland's major cities, which serve as economic, cultural, and educational hubs. The division of Poland into voivodeships has helped to promote regional development and has allowed the country to better manage its resources.
