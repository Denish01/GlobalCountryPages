[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Poland has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, each with its own characteristics. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal region, the mountainous south, and the low-lying central and eastern areas. The coastal region has a milder climate, with cooler summers and warmer winters, while the mountainous south has a more extreme climate, with cold winters and mild summers. The central and eastern areas have a continental climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Poland does not have a distinct dry or wet season, but the summer months tend to be the wettest, with most of the rainfall occurring in July and August.

The seasons in Poland have a significant impact on travel, with the spring and summer months being the best time to visit the country's many parks, gardens, and outdoor attractions. The autumn months, from September to November, are also a great time to visit, with the fall foliage making the countryside particularly picturesque. The winter months, from December to February, are the coldest and darkest, but they are also the best time to enjoy Poland's many winter sports and festivals.

Poland's climate and seasons also affect the types of activities and events that take place throughout the year. For example, the summer months are the best time for outdoor festivals and events, such as the **Krakow Film Festival** and the **Warsaw Uprising Museum**'s outdoor exhibitions. The winter months, on the other hand, are the best time for indoor events, such as the **Warsaw International Book Fair** and the **Krakow Jazz Festival**.
