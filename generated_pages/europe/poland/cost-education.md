[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Poland's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the former being generally free or subsidized for local students. The quality of public education is considered to be high, with Polish students consistently performing well in international rankings. The language of instruction is Polish, but many schools offer classes in foreign languages, particularly English. Compulsory education in Poland lasts for 12 years, from age 7 to 19, and is divided into primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary education. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Warsaw and Krakow, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.

The private education sector in Poland is smaller but still significant, with many private schools and universities offering high-quality education. Private schools often have smaller class sizes and more individualized attention, but can be more expensive than public schools. International schools, on the other hand, cater to expat families and offer a range of curricula, often with a focus on language instruction. Many of these schools are accredited by international organizations and offer a high-quality education, but can be quite expensive.
