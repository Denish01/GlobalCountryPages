[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Poland has several international airports, with the main ones being Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw and John Paul II International Airport Krakow-Balice in Krakow. These airports offer direct flights to many European cities, as well as some intercontinental destinations. You can also enter Poland by land from its neighboring countries, including Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Russia. The most popular overland entry points are the border crossings with Germany and the Czech Republic, which are well-connected to the rest of Europe by bus and train.

If you're planning to enter Poland by land, you can take a bus or train from major cities like Berlin, Prague, or Vienna. Many bus companies, such as FlixBus and Eurolines, operate daily services from these cities to Polish cities like Warsaw, Krakow, and Gdansk. Train services are also available, with the Polish national railway company, PKP, operating international trains to and from Poland. Additionally, you can also enter Poland by car, with the country's well-developed road network making it easy to drive from neighboring countries.

You can book domestic flights online through the airlines' websites or through a travel agency. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and time of booking.
