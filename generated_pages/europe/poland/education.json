Primary education, also known as **szkoła podstawowa**, typically lasts for six years and is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 13. Secondary education, or **szkoła średnia**, can be either general or vocational and lasts for three to four years. Tertiary education, which includes **universities** and **colleges**, offers a wide range of academic programs and can last from two to six years, depending on the field of study. The quality of education in Poland is generally high, with a strong emphasis on **science**, **technology**, **engineering**, and **mathematics (STEM)** fields. While public education is free and widely available, private schools and universities are also popular, especially among international students.\n\nThe Polish education system is known for its rigorous academic standards and highly qualified teachers. Students are required to take a series of exams, including the **matura**, which is a high school diploma equivalent, to graduate from secondary school and gain admission to universities. The system is also decentralized, with significant autonomy given to individual schools and universities to design their own curricula and programs. This has led to a diverse range of academic programs and specializations, making Poland an attractive destination for international students.\n\nOverall, the education system in Poland is well-regarded and has produced many notable scholars and professionals in various fields. However, like many other countries, it also faces challenges such as unequal access to quality education, especially in rural areas, and a need for continuous reform and modernization to keep up with changing global trends and demands.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
