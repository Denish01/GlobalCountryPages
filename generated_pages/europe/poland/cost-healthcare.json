  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Poland varies between public and private providers, with an average health expenditure per capita of $2,014, and out-of-pocket spending accounting for 16.2% of total healthcare costs.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,014\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 16.2%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: PLN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nPoland's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with a wide range of services available, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and specialist consultations. However, waiting times can be long, and the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific healthcare provider. For foreigners, the public healthcare system can be more challenging to navigate, and private healthcare providers may be a better option. Private healthcare providers in Poland offer high-quality care, with shorter waiting times and more modern facilities, but at a significantly higher cost.\n\nIn Poland, health insurance is mandatory for all citizens, and foreigners are also required to have insurance to access healthcare services. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and insurance contributions, while private healthcare providers rely on out-of-pocket payments and private insurance. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in Poland, as the public healthcare system may not provide the same level of care and service. Additionally, some private health insurance plans may offer more comprehensive coverage, including dental and vision care, which may not be covered by the public healthcare system.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $30-$60 | $100-$150 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$300 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialist consultations, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Worldwide coverage, including Poland, with comprehensive benefits and emergency evacuation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary widely, but on average, a month's supply of a common medication can cost between $10-$50.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available in pharmacies, with prices ranging from $5-$20.\n- Pharmacies are abundant in Poland, with many locations open 24 hours a day.\n- Prescription rules are strict, and medications can only be dispensed with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- Some medications may not be available in Poland, so it's essential to research and plan ahead.\n- Pharmacists in Poland are highly trained and can provide valuable advice on medication and health-related issues.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the emergency number 112, which is available 24 hours a day. Ambulance services are widely available, and emergency rooms are equipped to handle a range of medical emergencies. For foreigners, it's recommended to seek medical attention at a private hospital, which may have more English-speaking staff and better facilities. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Poland include the American Hospital in Warsaw and the Lux Med hospital chain, which offer high-quality care and a range of services, including emergency care and specialist consultations.\n\nIn a medical emergency, it's crucial to remain calm and provide as much information as possible to the emergency services operator. If you are not fluent in Polish, it's a good idea to have a translation app or a phrasebook with you to help communicate with medical staff. Additionally, having a copy of your health insurance documents and any relevant medical records can help facilitate the process and ensure that you receive the best possible care. [CALLOUT] It's always a good idea to research and plan ahead, especially when traveling to a foreign country, to ensure that you have access to quality medical care and emergency services.",
