[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Latvian cuisine is shaped by the country's location on the Baltic Sea, its history of being a crossroads between East and West, and its harsh climate. The cuisine is characterized by the use of local ingredients, such as **berries**, **mushrooms**, and **game meats**, and the influence of German, Russian, and Scandinavian cuisines. The country's geography has also played a significant role in shaping its cuisine, with the coastal regions focusing on **fish** and **seafood**, while the inland regions rely on **meat** and **vegetables**. Regional variations are also evident, with the western region of Kurzeme being known for its **fish dishes**, while the eastern region of Latgale is famous for its **pirogues** (meat-filled pastries).

The Latvian cuisine is also known for its hearty and comforting dishes, which are often served during special occasions and celebrations. The country's **midsummer festival**, for example, is celebrated with traditional dishes such as **Jāņu siers** (a type of cheese) and **skābeņu zupa** (a sour soup made with sorrel and pork). The **Christmas** season is also a time for traditional dishes, such as **aukstā kāpostu zupa** (a sour soup made with pork and vegetables) and **kāpostu pīrāgi** (cabbage-filled pastry).

Latvian cuisine has also been influenced by the country's history of being a part of the **Hanseatic League**, a medieval trade federation that connected the Baltic region with the rest of Europe. This has resulted in the introduction of new ingredients and cooking techniques, such as the use of **spices** and **herbs**, which are now an integral part of Latvian cuisine.
