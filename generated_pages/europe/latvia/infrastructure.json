  "content": "Latvia's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on modernization and investment in recent years, particularly in the transport and energy sectors.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 85%\nRoad Network: 73,200 km, with 22% of roads being high-quality highways\nRail Network: 2,270 km\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 6\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nLatvia has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure, with a focus on improving the quality of roads, railways, and energy systems. The country has invested heavily in upgrading its transport infrastructure, including the construction of new highways and the renovation of existing roads. This has improved connectivity between major cities and neighboring countries. However, there is still a noticeable urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with rural areas often lacking access to high-quality roads and other essential services. Recent investments have also focused on promoting the use of **renewable energy** sources, such as wind and biomass power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nThe Latvian government has implemented various initiatives to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth, including the development of **special economic zones** and **industrial parks**. These efforts have helped to stimulate economic activity and create new job opportunities, particularly in the manufacturing and logistics sectors. Despite these advances, Latvia still faces challenges in terms of its infrastructure development, including the need to upgrade its energy grid and improve the efficiency of its transport systems.\n\nLatvia's infrastructure development has also been influenced by its membership in the **European Union** and its participation in regional organizations such as the **Baltic Sea Region** initiative. These partnerships have provided Latvia with access to funding and expertise, enabling the country to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects and promote economic integration with its neighbors.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 73,200 km | Good | 22% of roads are highways, with a focus on improving road safety |\n| Railways | 2,270 km | Moderate | Rail network is being upgraded to improve efficiency and reduce travel times |\n| Airports | 3 international, 2 domestic | Good | Riga International Airport is the largest airport in the country |\n| Ports | 6 major | Good | Ports are well-equipped to handle cargo and passenger traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Latvia's power generation is primarily based on **imported natural gas** and **biomass**, with a growing focus on **renewable energy** sources such as wind and solar power.\n- The country has made significant progress in reducing its energy dependence on Russia, with a focus on diversifying its energy sources and promoting energy efficiency.\n- Latvia's energy grid is relatively reliable, with few power outages reported in recent years.\n- The government has set ambitious targets for increasing the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix, with a focus on promoting the development of **wind farms** and **solar parks**.\n- Latvia is also exploring the potential for **nuclear energy**, with plans to construct a new nuclear power plant in the coming years.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Tap water is generally safe to drink in Latvia, with a high level of water quality reported in urban areas.\n- Sanitation coverage is also high, with over 90% of the population having access to modern sanitation facilities.\n- However, there are still challenges in terms of water access in rural areas, where some communities lack access to piped water and rely on **wells** and **septic systems**.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve water management and reduce water pollution, including the construction of new **wastewater treatment plants**.\n- Latvia has also made progress in promoting **water conservation** and reducing water waste, with a focus on education and awareness-raising campaigns.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile coverage is widespread in Latvia, with over 95% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- The country has a well-developed **fiber-optic network**, with high-speed internet available in most urban areas.\n- Latvia has also made significant progress in rolling out **4G** and **5G** mobile networks, with several major operators offering high-speed mobile internet services.\n- The postal service is also well-developed, with a focus on promoting **e-commerce** and **digital services**.\n- Latvia has a relatively high level of **internet penetration**, with over 85% of the population having access to the internet.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Latvian government has launched several major infrastructure development projects, including the construction of a new **highway** connecting Riga to the Lithuanian border.\n- The country is also investing in the development of its **rail network**, with a focus on improving the efficiency and safety of rail transport.\n- Latvia has received funding from the **European Union** to support the development of its **energy sector**, including the construction of new **renewable energy** facilities.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to promote **urban development** and **regional growth**, including the creation of **special economic zones** and **innovation hubs**.\n- Latvia is also exploring the potential for **public-private partnerships** to support the development of its infrastructure, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth.",
