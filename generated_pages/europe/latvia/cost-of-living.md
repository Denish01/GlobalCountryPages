- Consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October) to avoid peak tourist prices.
- Look for accommodation outside of Riga's city center to save on rent.
- Eat at local eateries or try traditional Latvian cuisine, such as **Aukstā kāpostu zupa** (sour soup) or **Rupjmaize** (dark rye bread), which are often cheaper and more delicious than Western-style restaurants.
- Use public transportation instead of taxis to get around.
- Take advantage of Latvia's beautiful nature and outdoor activities, such as hiking or biking, which are often free or low-cost.
- Learn some basic Latvian phrases, such as **Sveika** (hello) or **Paldies** (thank you), to show respect for the local culture and people.
