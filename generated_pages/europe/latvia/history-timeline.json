  "content": "The history of Latvia is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans over a thousand years, from the ancient Baltic tribes to the modern-day sovereign state. \n\n[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]\nThe earliest known history of Latvia dates back to the **Stone Age**, with archaeological findings indicating human presence in the region as early as 9000 BC. The territory was later inhabited by the **Baltic tribes**, who were known for their skilled farming and trade practices. In the 13th century, Latvia was conquered by the **Teutonic Knights**, a German military order that introduced Christianity and established a feudal system. The region was later divided into several principalities, including the **Duchy of Courland** and the **Duchy of Livonia**, which were ruled by German and Polish nobles. \n\nIn the 18th century, Latvia was annexed by the **Russian Empire**, which had a profound impact on the country's language, culture, and politics. The Russian rule lasted for over a century, during which time the Latvian national identity began to take shape. The **Latvian National Awakening** of the 19th century saw a resurgence of interest in Latvian language and culture, which ultimately led to the country's struggle for independence. Latvia declared its independence in 1918, but it was not until 1920 that the country was recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. \n\nThe **interwar period** was marked by significant economic growth and cultural development, but it was also a time of political instability. In 1940, Latvia was occupied by the **Soviet Union**, which led to the suppression of the Latvian language and culture. The country suffered greatly during **World War II**, with many Latvians being deported to Siberia or forced to flee to other countries. After the war, Latvia remained under Soviet rule until 1991, when it regained its independence. \n\nSince then, Latvia has made significant progress in its economic and political development, joining the **European Union** and **NATO** in 2004. Today, Latvia is a modern, democratic country with a strong economy and a rich cultural heritage. \n\n[SECTION] Timeline of Key Events [/SECTION]\n1. **9000 BC** - The first human settlements appear in the region, marking the beginning of Latvia's history. \n2. **1200 AD** - The Teutonic Knights conquer Latvia and introduce Christianity. \n3. **1561** - The Livonian War ends, and Latvia is divided into several principalities. \n4. **1721** - Latvia is annexed by the Russian Empire. \n5. **1830s** - The Latvian National Awakening begins, with a focus on promoting Latvian language and culture. \n6. **1905** - The Russian Revolution leads to increased autonomy for Latvia. \n7. **1918** - Latvia declares its independence from Russia. \n8. **1920** - Latvia is recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. \n9. **1940** - Latvia is occupied by the Soviet Union. \n10. **1941** - Latvia is occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. \n11. **1944** - The Soviet Union reoccupies Latvia. \n12. **1987** - The Latvian independence movement begins to gain momentum. \n13. **1990** - The Latvian Supreme Soviet declares the country's independence from the Soviet Union. \n14. **1991** - Latvia is recognized as an independent country by the international community. \n15. **2004** - Latvia joins the European Union and NATO. \n16. **2014** - Latvia adopts the euro as its official currency. \n17. **2015** - Latvia holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union. \n18. **2018** - Latvia celebrates its centenary as an independent country. \n19. **2020** - Latvia marks 30 years since the restoration of its independence. \n20. **2022** - Latvia continues to strengthen its ties with the European Union and NATO. \n\n[SECTION] Founding & Formation [/SECTION]\nLatvia's founding and formation as a modern state is a complex and multifaceted process that involved the contributions of many key figures.
