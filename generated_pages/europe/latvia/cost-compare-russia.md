[SECTION] Overview: Latvia vs Russia [/SECTION]
Latvia and Russia are two neighboring countries with distinct economic profiles. Latvia, a member of the European Union, has a high-income economy with a strong service sector, while Russia has a mixed economy with a significant oil and gas industry. The cost of living in Latvia is generally higher than in Russia, due to its proximity to Western Europe and higher standards of living. However, Russia's larger size and more diverse economy mean that prices can vary significantly depending on the region. On average, Latvia is around 20-30% more expensive than Russia, with the biggest differences in housing, food, and transportation costs.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Latvia's economy is more integrated with the European Union, which means that prices are influenced by EU-wide trends and regulations. In contrast, Russia's economy is more isolated, with a greater emphasis on domestic production and trade. This can result in lower prices for certain goods and services, particularly those that are heavily subsidized by the government. However, it also means that Russia's economy can be more vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global oil prices.
