[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Latvia has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available. Public healthcare is generally considered to be of good quality, but may have longer wait times and less modern equipment compared to private facilities. Locals typically have access to public healthcare through their employment or social insurance, while foreigners may need to purchase private health insurance to receive adequate care. The system works on a referral basis, with patients typically needing to see a general practitioner before being referred to a specialist.

The quality of care in public facilities can vary, with some hospitals and clinics being better equipped and staffed than others. Private facilities, on the other hand, tend to have more modern equipment and shorter wait times, but can be significantly more expensive. For foreigners, it is often recommended to purchase private health insurance to ensure access to high-quality care. This can help to cover the costs of medical treatment, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and procedures.
