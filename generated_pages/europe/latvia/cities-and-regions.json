These cities have a higher degree of autonomy and are directly supervised by the central government. The municipalities, on the other hand, are further divided into smaller units called parishes or pagasti. This administrative structure allows for a more decentralized approach to governance, enabling local communities to have a greater say in decision-making processes.\n\nThe country is also divided into four historical regions: Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme, and Zemgale. These regions have distinct cultural and historical identities, which are reflected in their architecture, traditions, and dialects. While they do not have any formal administrative powers, they play an important role in shaping the country's cultural heritage and regional identity.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Riga** (696,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning Art Nouveau architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and historic Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nBest For: history buffs, architecture enthusiasts, and those interested in cultural events\n\n**Daugavpils** (82,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, cultural diversity, and stunning architecture, including the Daugavpils Fortress\nBest For: history enthusiasts, cultural explorers, and those interested in regional cuisine\n\n**Liepaja** (68,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its beautiful beaches, vibrant cultural scene, and historic Old Town\nBest For: beachgoers, music lovers, and those interested in maritime history\n\n**Jelgava** (55,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning Baroque architecture, historic palace, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: history enthusiasts, architecture buffs, and those interested in cultural events\n\n**Jurmala** (50,000)\nRole: resort town, economic hub\nKnown For: its stunning beaches, scenic coastline, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: beachgoers, nature lovers, and those interested in water sports\n\n**Ventspils** (34,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its beautiful beaches, vibrant cultural scene, and historic Old Town\nBest For: beachgoers, music lovers, and those interested in maritime history\n\n**Rezekne** (32,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning architecture, historic castle, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: history enthusiasts, architecture buffs, and those interested in cultural events\n\n**Valmiera** (24,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning architecture, historic castle, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: history enthusiasts, architecture buffs, and those interested in cultural events\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vidzeme | historic, cultural | stunning architecture, historic towns | Riga |\n| Latgale | cultural, historic | traditional folklore, scenic lakes | Daugavpils |\n| Kurzeme | coastal, scenic | beautiful beaches, vibrant cultural scene | Liepaja |\n| Zemgale | agricultural, historic | rolling hills, historic castles | Jelgava |\n| Sēlija | cultural, historic | traditional folklore, scenic countryside | Aizkraukle |\n| Selonia | cultural, historic | traditional folklore, scenic countryside | Bauska |\n| Livonia | historic, cultural | stunning architecture, historic towns | Riga |\n| Courland | coastal, scenic | beautiful beaches, vibrant cultural scene | Ventspils |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Latvia differ significantly in terms of culture, with Vidzeme and Latgale having a more traditional and conservative approach, while Kurzeme and Zemgale are more liberal and open-minded.\n- The economy also varies across regions, with Riga being the economic hub of the country, while other regions have a more agricultural or industrial focus.\n- The climate differs slightly across regions, with the coastal areas being more prone to maritime influences and the inland regions having a more continental climate.\n- The language spoken in different regions also varies, with Latvian being the official language, but Russian and other minority languages being spoken in certain areas.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nLatvia has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and driving being the main modes of transportation.
