Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and tenants are entitled to a written lease agreement and a refund of their deposit at the end of the lease. Compared to its regional neighbors, Latvia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Estonia but higher than in Lithuania. The country's economic stability and growing GDP per capita have contributed to an increase in housing demand, particularly in the capital city of Riga.\n\nThe housing market in Latvia is also influenced by the country's history and cultural heritage. Many old buildings have been restored and converted into apartments, offering a unique and charming living experience. However, the quality of housing can vary significantly depending on the location and age of the building. In general, apartments in the city center tend to be more expensive and of higher quality, while those in the suburbs or rural areas may be more affordable but with fewer amenities. Overall, Latvia offers a range of housing options to suit different budgets and preferences, from modern apartments in the city center to traditional houses in the countryside.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$900 | $400-$700 | (typical quality, 20-40 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $500-$900 | (what to expect, 40-60 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,400 | (family size, 60-80 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$2,000 | (spacious, 80-100 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$3,500 | (prime locations, new buildings) |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | (residential areas, older buildings) |\n| Rural | $800-$1,500 | (if applicable, traditional houses) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Centrs**: The city center, with a typical rent range of $800-$1,200 per month, offers a vibrant and convenient living experience, with many amenities and services within walking distance.\n- **Vecrīga**: The old town, with a typical rent range of $900-$1,500 per month, is a charming and historic area, with many restored buildings and a lively atmosphere.\n- **Āgenskalns**: A trendy neighborhood, with a typical rent range of $600-$1,000 per month, known for its bohemian vibe and proximity to the city center.\n- **Pļavnieki**: A suburban neighborhood, with a typical rent range of $400-$800 per month, offering a more relaxed and family-friendly environment, with easy access to the city center.\n- **Zolitude**: A residential neighborhood, with a typical rent range of $500-$900 per month, located in the western part of Riga, known for its green spaces and convenient transportation links.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Latvia [/SECTION]\n- When searching for housing, it's essential to work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to avoid scams and ensure a smooth rental process.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and lease terms, as this is a common practice in Latvia.\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and heating are usually not included in the rent, so be sure to factor these costs into your budget.\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Latvia, so be prepared to purchase or rent furniture if needed.\n- Always inspect the property carefully before signing a lease agreement, and take photos and notes to document the condition of the property.\n- Consider purchasing **home insurance** to protect yourself against unforeseen events, such as damage to the property or loss of personal belongings.",
