Public healthcare is generally considered to be of good quality, but may have longer wait times and less modern equipment compared to private facilities. Locals typically have access to public healthcare through their employment or social insurance, while foreigners may need to purchase private health insurance to receive adequate care. The system works on a referral basis, with patients typically needing to see a general practitioner before being referred to a specialist.\n\nThe quality of care in public facilities can vary, with some hospitals and clinics being better equipped and staffed than others. Private facilities, on the other hand, tend to have more modern equipment and shorter wait times, but can be significantly more expensive. For foreigners, it is often recommended to purchase private health insurance to ensure access to high-quality care. This can help to cover the costs of medical treatment, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and procedures.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Longer wait times in public facilities |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | May require referral from GP |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private facilities may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Some private facilities may offer advanced eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | May be covered by public healthcare for locals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | May be covered by public healthcare for locals |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private facilities may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | May require pre-authorization from insurance provider |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private facilities may offer more comprehensive maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | May be covered by public healthcare for locals |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | May be covered by public healthcare for locals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Advanced medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Comprehensive medical services, including emergency evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $5-$50 per month, depending on the type and quantity of medication.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and can cost between $5-$20 per item.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a licensed doctor, while others can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n- It is recommended to check the prices and availability of medications before traveling to Latvia.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 113 or visit the nearest hospital.
