The country has experienced a declining population growth rate, with a negative rate of -0.3% due to low fertility rates and an aging population. Urbanization is a significant trend in Latvia, with around 68% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Riga and other major cities such as Daugavpils and Liepaja. Migration patterns in Latvia are characterized by a brain drain of young, educated individuals seeking better job opportunities abroad, as well as an influx of migrant workers from other European countries.\n\nThe population of Latvia is also characterized by a high level of education, with around 90% of the population having completed secondary education or higher. This has contributed to a highly skilled workforce, with a strong emphasis on technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
