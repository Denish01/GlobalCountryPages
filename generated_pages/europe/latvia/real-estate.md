The Latvian property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the country's strong economy and increasing demand for housing. The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a focus on renovation and redevelopment of historic properties. Riga, the capital city, is the most popular area for investment, with prices ranging from $2,000 to $5,000 per square meter. The urban areas tend to have higher prices compared to rural areas, where prices can be significantly lower. The current market trend is towards an increase in prices, especially in the luxury segment, with a growing demand for high-end properties.

The Latvian property market is also influenced by the country's proximity to the Baltic Sea and its strategic location between Europe and Russia. This has led to an increase in foreign investment, particularly from countries such as Russia and China. However, the market is also subject to fluctuations in the global economy, and the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the market. Despite this, the market is expected to continue growing, driven by the country's strong economy and increasing demand for housing.

In terms of trends, there is a growing demand for sustainable and energy-efficient properties, as well as a focus on renovation and redevelopment of historic properties. The government has also implemented various initiatives to support the development of the property market, including tax incentives and subsidies for homebuyers.
