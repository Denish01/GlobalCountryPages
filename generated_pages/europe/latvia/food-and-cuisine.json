The cuisine is characterized by the use of local ingredients, such as **berries**, **mushrooms**, and **game meats**, and the influence of German, Russian, and Scandinavian cuisines. The country's geography has also played a significant role in shaping its cuisine, with the coastal regions focusing on **fish** and **seafood**, while the inland regions rely on **meat** and **vegetables**. Regional variations are also evident, with the western region of Kurzeme being known for its **fish dishes**, while the eastern region of Latgale is famous for its **pirogues** (meat-filled pastries).\n\nThe Latvian cuisine is also known for its hearty and comforting dishes, which are often served during special occasions and celebrations. The country's **midsummer festival**, for example, is celebrated with traditional dishes such as **Jāņu siers** (a type of cheese) and **skābeņu zupa** (a sour soup made with sorrel and pork). The **Christmas** season is also a time for traditional dishes, such as **aukstā kāpostu zupa** (a sour soup made with pork and vegetables) and **kāpostu pīrāgi** (cabbage-filled pastry).\n\nLatvian cuisine has also been influenced by the country's history of being a part of the **Hanseatic League**, a medieval trade federation that connected the Baltic region with the rest of Europe. This has resulted in the introduction of new ingredients and cooking techniques, such as the use of **spices** and **herbs**, which are now an integral part of Latvian cuisine.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aukstā kāpostu zupa | Soup | Sour soup made with pork, vegetables, and sour cream | Traditional restaurants in Riga |\n| Rupjmaize | Bread | Dark, dense rye bread, often served with butter or cheese | Local bakeries and markets |\n| Siļķe ar biezpienu | Appetizer | Pickled herring with sour cream and boiled potatoes | Seafood restaurants in coastal towns |\n| Frikadeļu zupa | Soup | Meatball soup made with pork and beef, served with rye bread | Family-run restaurants in rural areas |\n| Kibinai | Pastry | Meat-filled pastry, similar to a samosa, often served with soup or salad | Street food stalls in Riga |\n| Aukstā kāpostu pīrāgi | Pastry | Cabbage-filled pastry, often served as a side dish or snack | Local markets and food courts |\n| Zivs ar avižņu | Main Course | Fish with oatmeal and vegetables, often served with boiled potatoes | Seafood restaurants in Riga |\n| Skābeņu zupa | Soup | Sour soup made with sorrel and pork, often served with boiled eggs and sour cream | Traditional restaurants in rural areas |\n| Šaltibaršas | Salad | Cold beet soup, made with beets, sour cream, and boiled eggs | Local markets and food courts |\n| Pankūkas | Dessert | Pancakes filled with jam and sour cream, often served with coffee or tea | Cafes and bakeries in Riga |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Kibinai**: meat-filled pastry, often served with soup or salad, $3-$5\n- **Rupjmaize**: dark, dense rye bread, often served with butter or cheese, $2-$3\n- **Siļķe ar biezpienu**: pickled herring with sour cream and boiled potatoes, $5-$7\n- **Frikadeļu**: meatballs, often served with rye bread and soup, $4-$6\n- **Aukstā kāpostu pīrāgi**: cabbage-filled pastry, often served as a side dish or snack, $3-$5\n- **Šaltibaršas**: cold beet soup, made with beets, sour cream, and boiled eggs, $4-$6\n- **Pankūkas**: pancakes filled with jam and sour cream, often served with coffee or tea, $5-$7\n- **Biezpiens**: sour cream, often served with boiled potatoes and rye bread, $2-$3\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Rīgas melnais balzāms**: a traditional Latvian liqueur made with blackcurrant and other ingredients, $10-$15\n- **Aldaris**: a popular Latvian beer, $5-$7\n- **Žalgiris**: a Latvian mineral water, $2-$3\n- **Kvass**: a traditional Latvian fermented bread drink, $3-$5\n- **Gaisa piens**: a Latvian sparkling water, $2-$3\n- **Kafe**: coffee, often served with milk and sugar, $3-$5\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Table manners**: it is customary to keep your hands visible on the table, and not to eat with your left hand\n- **Tipping**: 5-10% of the total bill is customary\n- **Reservation culture**: reservations are recommended for popular restaurants, especially on weekends\n- **Dress code**: casual dress is acceptable in most restaurants, but formal attire is required in high-end establishments\n- **Eating etiquette**: it is customary to wait for the host to start eating before you begin, and to finish your meal before leaving the table\n- **Beverages**: it is customary to order a beverage with your meal, such as beer or wine\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional restaurants**: try **Alezio** or **Kaļķu vārti** in Riga for traditional Latvian cuisine\n- **Seafood restaurants**: try **Fish Restaurant** or **Ocean** in coastal towns for fresh seafood\n- **Food courts**: try **Riga Central Market** or **Spice** in Riga for a variety of food options\n- **Street food stalls**: try **Kibinai** or **Rupjmaize** in Riga for traditional street food\n- **Cafes**: try **Café Miera iela** or **Café Aleksandra** in Riga for coffee and pastries\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Riga Central Market**: a large market in Riga offering a variety of food options, including traditional Latvian dishes and fresh produce\n- **Latgale Market**: a market in the eastern region of Latgale offering traditional Latgale cuisine and local products\n- **Kurzeme Market**: a market in the western region of Kurzeme offering fresh seafood and local products\n- **Riga Food Festival**: an annual festival in Riga celebrating Latvian cuisine and food culture\n- **Baltic Gastronomy Festival**: an annual festival in Riga celebrating the cuisine of the Baltic region",
