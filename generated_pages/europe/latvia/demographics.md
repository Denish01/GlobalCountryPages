[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Latvia's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, with a total population of approximately 1.9 million people. The country has experienced a declining population growth rate, with a negative rate of -0.3% due to low fertility rates and an aging population. Urbanization is a significant trend in Latvia, with around 68% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Riga and other major cities such as Daugavpils and Liepaja. Migration patterns in Latvia are characterized by a brain drain of young, educated individuals seeking better job opportunities abroad, as well as an influx of migrant workers from other European countries.

The population of Latvia is also characterized by a high level of education, with around 90% of the population having completed secondary education or higher. This has contributed to a highly skilled workforce, with a strong emphasis on technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship. However, the country's aging population and low fertility rates pose significant challenges for the future, including a shrinking workforce and increased pressure on the pension system.

In terms of regional distribution, the population of Latvia is concentrated in the central and western regions, with the capital city of Riga being the most populous urban area. The eastern region of Latgale is more sparsely populated, with a higher proportion of rural residents.
