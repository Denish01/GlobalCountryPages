The rental market in Latvia is relatively stable, with a mix of old and new buildings available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent.

Compared to its regional neighbors, Latvia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Estonia but higher than in Lithuania. The country's economic stability and growing GDP per capita have contributed to an increase in housing demand, particularly in the capital city of Riga.

The housing market in Latvia is also influenced by the country's history and cultural heritage. Many old buildings have been restored and converted into apartments, offering a unique and charming living experience. However, the quality of housing can vary significantly depending on the location and age of the building. In general, apartments in the city center tend to be more expensive and of higher quality, while those in the suburbs or rural areas may be more affordable but with fewer amenities. Overall, Latvia offers a range of housing options to suit different budgets and preferences, from modern apartments in the city center to traditional houses in the countryside.
