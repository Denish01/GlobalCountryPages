# Latvia History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Latvia is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans over a thousand years, from the ancient Baltic tribes to the modern-day sovereign state. 

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The earliest known history of Latvia dates back to the **Stone Age**, with archaeological findings indicating human presence in the region as early as 9000 BC. The territory was later inhabited by the **Baltic tribes**, who were known for their skilled farming and trade practices. In the 13th century, Latvia was conquered by the **Teutonic Knights**, a German military order that introduced Christianity and established a feudal system. The region was later divided into several principalities, including the **Duchy of Courland** and the **Duchy of Livonia**, which were ruled by German and Polish nobles. 

In the 18th century, Latvia was annexed by the **Russian Empire**, which had a profound impact on the country's language, culture, and politics. The Russian rule lasted for over a century, during which time the Latvian national identity began to take shape. The **Latvian National Awakening** of the 19th century saw a resurgence of interest in Latvian language and culture, which ultimately led to the country's struggle for independence. Latvia declared its independence in 1918, but it was not until 1920 that the country was recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. 

The **interwar period** was marked by significant economic growth and cultural development, but it was also a time of political instability. In 1940, Latvia was occupied by the **Soviet Union**, which led to the suppression of the Latvian language and culture. The country suffered greatly during **World War II**, with many Latvians being deported to Siberia or forced to flee to other countries. After the war, Latvia remained under Soviet rule until 1991, when it regained its independence. 

Since then, Latvia has made significant progress in its economic and political development, joining the **European Union** and **NATO** in 2004. Today, Latvia is a modern, democratic country with a strong economy and a rich cultural heritage.
