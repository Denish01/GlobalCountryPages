[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Latvia has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure, with a focus on improving the quality of roads, railways, and energy systems. The country has invested heavily in upgrading its transport infrastructure, including the construction of new highways and the renovation of existing roads. This has improved connectivity between major cities and neighboring countries. However, there is still a noticeable urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure development, with rural areas often lacking access to high-quality roads and other essential services. Recent investments have also focused on promoting the use of **renewable energy** sources, such as wind and biomass power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.

The Latvian government has implemented various initiatives to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth, including the development of **special economic zones** and **industrial parks**. These efforts have helped to stimulate economic activity and create new job opportunities, particularly in the manufacturing and logistics sectors. Despite these advances, Latvia still faces challenges in terms of its infrastructure development, including the need to upgrade its energy grid and improve the efficiency of its transport systems.

Latvia's infrastructure development has also been influenced by its membership in the **European Union** and its participation in regional organizations such as the **Baltic Sea Region** initiative. These partnerships have provided Latvia with access to funding and expertise, enabling the country to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects and promote economic integration with its neighbors.
