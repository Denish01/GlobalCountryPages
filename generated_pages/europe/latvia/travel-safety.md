[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Latvia is generally a safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other European countries. The capital city, Riga, is a popular tourist destination, and most visitors have a trouble-free experience. However, as with any country, there are some areas and situations that require caution. Petty crimes such as pickpocketing and theft can occur in crowded areas and tourist hotspots, while violent crimes are relatively rare. The country has a well-organized police force and a strong emphasis on law and order, which contributes to its overall safety.

The risk of scams is moderate, with some reports of taxi drivers overcharging tourists and scams targeting visitors at airports and bus stations. Additionally, there are some areas in Riga and other cities that are best avoided, particularly at night, due to high levels of crime and anti-social behavior. Nevertheless, with some basic precautions and an awareness of potential risks, visitors can have a safe and enjoyable experience in Latvia. The country's stunning natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and friendly people make it a great destination for travelers.
