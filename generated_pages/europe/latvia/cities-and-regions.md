[SECTION] How Latvia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Latvia is divided into 119 municipalities and 9 cities under state jurisdiction, also known as republic cities. These cities have a higher degree of autonomy and are directly supervised by the central government. The municipalities, on the other hand, are further divided into smaller units called parishes or pagasti. This administrative structure allows for a more decentralized approach to governance, enabling local communities to have a greater say in decision-making processes.

The country is also divided into four historical regions: Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme, and Zemgale. These regions have distinct cultural and historical identities, which are reflected in their architecture, traditions, and dialects. While they do not have any formal administrative powers, they play an important role in shaping the country's cultural heritage and regional identity.
