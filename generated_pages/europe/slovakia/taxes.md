[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Slovakia operates a **territorial taxation** system, where tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the taxpayer's residence. However, individuals who are considered **tax residents** in Slovakia are subject to **worldwide taxation**, meaning they are taxed on their global income, not just income earned in Slovakia. Tax residency is determined by the number of days spent in the country, with individuals spending more than 183 days in a calendar year considered tax residents.

The Slovak tax system is based on the concept of **residency**, with different rules applying to residents and non-residents. Residents are subject to tax on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on income earned in Slovakia. The tax authorities in Slovakia consider various factors, including the individual's **permanent home**, **family ties**, and **economic interests**, when determining tax residency.
