[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Slovakia has a **mixed healthcare system**, which combines elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long, and the quality of care can vary depending on the region. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the preferred option, as it is more affordable and widely available. For foreigners, private healthcare may be a better option, as it often offers faster access to care and more modern facilities. It is recommended that foreigners have some form of **health insurance**, as the cost of medical care can be high, especially for private care.
