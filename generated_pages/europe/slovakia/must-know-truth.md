# The Truth About Slovakia - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Slovakia has a rich and complex history, with various periods of occupation and independence. The territory that is now Slovakia was first inhabited by the Celts and later by the Romans. In the 9th century, the Great Moravian Empire was established, which included present-day Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and parts of Hungary and Poland. The empire was later divided, and Slovakia became part of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1918, Slovakia joined with the Czech lands to form Czechoslovakia, which gained independence from Austria-Hungary after World War I. Czechoslovakia existed until 1993, when it peacefully split into two separate countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

The history of Slovakia is also marked by various invasions and occupations, including the Mongol invasion in the 13th century and the Ottoman Empire's expansion in the 16th century. In the 20th century, Slovakia was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II, and after the war, it became a socialist state under the influence of the Soviet Union. In 1989, a peaceful revolution known as the Velvet Revolution led to the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, and in 1993, Slovakia became an independent country.
