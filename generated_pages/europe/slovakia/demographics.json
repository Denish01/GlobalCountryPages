  "content": "The population of Slovakia is comprised of approximately 5.4 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a unique and culturally rich country in the heart of Europe.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 5.4 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.03%\nMedian Age: 41 years\nUrban Population: 53.5%\nPopulation Density: 110 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 77 years\nFertility Rate: 1.5 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nSlovakia's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but it has a significant impact on the region due to its strategic location and economic ties. The population growth rate is relatively low, with a slight increase in recent years due to a combination of natural growth and net migration. Urbanization is a significant trend in Slovakia, with over half of the population living in urban areas, particularly in the capital city of Bratislava and other major cities like Košice and Žilina. Migration patterns in Slovakia are characterized by a mix of immigration from other European countries and emigration of Slovak citizens to countries like the Czech Republic, Austria, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe population of Slovakia is projected to continue growing at a slow rate, with a forecasted increase of 1.5% by 2030. This growth will be driven primarily by natural increase, as well as a moderate level of net migration. However, the country's population is also aging, with a significant proportion of citizens aged 65 and older, which poses challenges for the pension system and healthcare services. To address these challenges, the government has implemented policies aimed at increasing fertility rates and attracting more immigrants to the country.\n\nSlovakia's population is also characterized by a high level of education, with over 90% of the population having completed secondary education or higher. This has contributed to the country's economic growth and development, particularly in the service sector. However, regional disparities in population density and economic development remain a challenge, with some areas experiencing significant out-migration and economic decline.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Slovaks | 80.7% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Hungarians | 8.5% | Southern regions | Significant minority group |\n| Roma | 2.0% | Eastern and southern regions | Minority group facing social and economic challenges |\n| Czechs | 0.6% | Western regions | Minority group with historical ties to Slovakia |\n| Ruthenians | 0.6% | Eastern regions | Minority group with cultural and linguistic ties to Ukraine |\n| Ukrainians | 0.4% | Eastern regions | Minority group with cultural and linguistic ties to Ukraine |\n| Germans | 0.1% | Western regions | Minority group with historical ties to Slovakia |\n[/TABLE]\nSlovakia's ethnic landscape is characterized by a dominant Slovak population, with significant minority groups, including Hungarians, Roma, and Czechs.
