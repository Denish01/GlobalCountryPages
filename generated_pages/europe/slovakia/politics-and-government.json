  "content": "Slovakia is a **parliamentary representative democratic republic** with a system of government that divides power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Parliamentary Representative Democratic Republic\nHead of State: President (Zuzana Čaputová)\nHead of Government: Prime Minister (Ľudovít Ódor)\nLegislature: National Council of the Slovak Republic, unicameral with 150 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: 0.73 (ranked 53rd out of 178 countries in terms of stability, according to the Fragile States Index)\nCorruption Index: 50/100 (ranked 56th out of 180 countries, according to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Slovakia is based on the principles of **democratic governance**, **separation of powers**, and **representative democracy**. The **Constitution of Slovakia**, adopted in 1992, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the various branches. The **executive branch** is headed by the **Prime Minister**, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of government policies. The **legislative branch**, composed of the **National Council of the Slovak Republic**, has the power to pass laws and approve the government's budget. The **judicial branch**, composed of the **Constitutional Court** and the **Supreme Court**, is responsible for interpreting the constitution and ensuring that laws are consistent with it.\n\nThe Slovak government is a **unitary state**, with a centralized administration and a system of regional and local governments. The **regions** (kraje) and **districts** (okresy) have a degree of autonomy, but the central government retains significant powers.
