The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the lowlands, the mountains, and the highlands. The lowlands, which include the capital city Bratislava, have a more moderate climate, with warm summers and cold winters. The mountains, which cover a significant part of the country, have a colder climate, with heavy snowfall during the winter months. The highlands, which include the **Tatra Mountains**, have a harsher climate, with long and cold winters.\n\nThe dry season in Slovakia typically runs from April to October, with the summer months being the driest. The wet season, which runs from November to March, is characterized by increased rainfall and potential snowstorms. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the summer months being the peak tourist season, and the winter months being the low season.
