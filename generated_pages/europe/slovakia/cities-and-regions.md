[SECTION] How Slovakia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Slovakia is a sovereign country located in Central Europe, bordered by five countries: the Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, and Austria. The country is divided into 8 regions, known as kraje, which are further subdivided into 79 districts, or okresy. Each region has its own capital and administrative center, and they vary in terms of population, economy, and culture. The regions are: Bratislava, Trnava, Trenčín, Nitra, Žilina, Banská Bystrica, Košice, and Prešov.

The administrative structure of Slovakia is designed to provide a balance between central government control and regional autonomy. The regions have a significant degree of independence in areas such as education, healthcare, and transportation, while the central government is responsible for national policy, defense, and foreign affairs. This division of power allows for a more efficient and effective governance of the country, and enables the regions to respond to local needs and priorities.
