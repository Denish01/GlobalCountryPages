[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Slovakia is based on the principles of **democratic governance**, **separation of powers**, and **representative democracy**. The **Constitution of Slovakia**, adopted in 1992, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the various branches. The **executive branch** is headed by the **Prime Minister**, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of government policies. The **legislative branch**, composed of the **National Council of the Slovak Republic**, has the power to pass laws and approve the government's budget. The **judicial branch**, composed of the **Constitutional Court** and the **Supreme Court**, is responsible for interpreting the constitution and ensuring that laws are consistent with it.

The Slovak government is a **unitary state**, with a centralized administration and a system of regional and local governments. The **regions** (kraje) and **districts** (okresy) have a degree of autonomy, but the central government retains significant powers. The **separation of powers** is designed to prevent any one branch of government from dominating the others, and to ensure that power is distributed fairly and evenly.

The **political system** in Slovakia is characterized by a **multiparty system**, with several parties represented in the National Council. The government is typically formed by a **coalition** of parties, which must work together to pass laws and approve the budget. This system encourages **compromise** and **cooperation** between parties, and helps to prevent any one party from dominating the government.
