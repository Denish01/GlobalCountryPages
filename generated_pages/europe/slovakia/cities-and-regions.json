The country is divided into 8 regions, known as kraje, which are further subdivided into 79 districts, or okresy. Each region has its own capital and administrative center, and they vary in terms of population, economy, and culture. The regions are: Bratislava, Trnava, Trenčín, Nitra, Žilina, Banská Bystrica, Košice, and Prešov.\n\nThe administrative structure of Slovakia is designed to provide a balance between central government control and regional autonomy. The regions have a significant degree of independence in areas such as education, healthcare, and transportation, while the central government is responsible for national policy, defense, and foreign affairs. This division of power allows for a more efficient and effective governance of the country, and enables the regions to respond to local needs and priorities.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Bratislava** (470,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic old town, castle, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and nightlife\n\n**Košice** (240,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its well-preserved medieval center, cultural festivals, and outdoor activities\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n**Žilina** (150,000)\nRole: economic hub, transportation center\nKnown For: its historic center, cultural events, and proximity to the Tatra Mountains\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n**Nitra** (80,000)\nRole: cultural center, agricultural hub\nKnown For: its historic center, castle, and wine production\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and wine\n\n**Banská Bystrica** (70,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic center, cultural events, and proximity to the Low Tatra Mountains\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n**Trnava** (60,000)\nRole: cultural center, educational hub\nKnown For: its historic center, cultural events, and university\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and education\n\n**Trenčín** (50,000)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic center, castle, and cultural events\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bratislava | urban, cosmopolitan | historic old town, castle, cultural events | Bratislava |\n| Trnava | historic, cultural | historic center, cultural events, university | Trnava |\n| Trenčín | historic, economic | historic center, castle, industrial production | Trenčín |\n| Nitra | agricultural, cultural | historic center, castle, wine production | Nitra |\n| Žilina | economic, cultural | historic center, cultural events, transportation hub | Žilina |\n| Banská Bystrica | economic, cultural | historic center, cultural events, outdoor activities | Banská Bystrica |\n| Košice | economic, cultural | historic center, cultural festivals, outdoor activities | Košice |\n| Prešov | cultural, rural | historic center, cultural events, traditional crafts | Prešov |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Slovakia differ significantly in terms of culture, with the western regions being more influenced by Austrian and Hungarian traditions, while the eastern regions have a stronger Ukrainian and Polish influence.\n- The economy of the regions varies, with the Bratislava region being the most developed and industrialized, while the eastern regions are more agricultural and rural.\n- The climate of the regions also differs, with the mountainous regions having a colder and more snowy climate, while the low-lying regions have a milder and more temperate climate.\n- The language spoken in the regions is predominantly Slovak, but there are also significant Hungarian and Roma minority populations, particularly in the southern and eastern regions.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nSlovakia has a well-developed transportation network, with a range of options for getting around the country.
