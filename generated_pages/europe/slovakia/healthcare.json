The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, and a wide range of medical specialties available. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better access to specialized care and more modern facilities. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and health insurance contributions, and most medical services are free or low-cost for citizens and registered long-term residents.\n\nThe private healthcare sector in Slovakia is also well-developed, with many private clinics and hospitals offering high-quality medical care, often with shorter waiting times and more modern facilities than public providers. Private healthcare is generally more expensive than public healthcare, but many private providers offer services that are not available in the public system, such as specialized diagnostic testing and elective surgical procedures. Many private healthcare providers also offer services in English and other languages, making them a popular choice for foreigners and expats.\n\nOverall, Slovakia's healthcare system is considered to be of good quality, with a wide range of medical services available, and a high level of accessibility, especially in urban areas. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, and between urban and rural areas, and visitors and expats should research their options carefully before seeking medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| University Hospital Bratislava | Bratislava | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| St. Elizabeth's Hospital | Bratislava | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Hospital Košice | Košice | Public | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Limited |\n| Hospital Nitra | Nitra | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinic of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery | Bratislava | Private | Plastic surgery, cosmetic surgery | Yes |\n| Euroclinic | Bratislava | Private | General medicine, surgery, dental care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Public health insurance** is available to citizens and registered long-term residents, and is generally considered to be of good quality and affordable.\n- **Private health insurance** is also available, and can provide additional coverage and services not available in the public system.\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for visitors, as it can provide coverage for unexpected medical expenses and emergencies.\n- **Expats** may be eligible for public health insurance, or may choose to purchase private health insurance, depending on their individual circumstances.\n- **Costs** for health insurance can vary widely, depending on the type of coverage and the provider, but are generally considered to be affordable.\n- **Prescription medication** is often covered by health insurance, but may require a co-payment or deductible.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in Slovakia, and can be obtained at pharmacies with a valid prescription.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also widely available, and can be purchased at pharmacies without a prescription.\n- **Pharmacies** are widespread, with many locations in urban and rural areas, and are generally well-stocked with a wide range of medications and health products.\n- **Common brands** of medications are widely available, including international brands and generic alternatives.\n- **Costs** for medications can vary, but are generally considered to be affordable, with many medications covered by health insurance or available at a low cost.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Routine vaccinations** such as MMR and DTaP are recommended for all travelers to Slovakia.\n- **Hepatitis A** vaccination is recommended for all travelers, especially those who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Hepatitis B** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be having medical procedures, getting a tattoo, or having sex while in Slovakia.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be spending time in rural areas or working with animals.\n- **Tick-borne encephalitis** is a risk in some areas of Slovakia, and vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be spending time outdoors.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Slovakia, but travelers should still take precautions to avoid drinking untreated water or eating untercooked foods.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Slovakia** is becoming an increasingly popular destination for medical tourism, with many high-quality private hospitals and clinics offering a wide range of medical services.\n- **Popular procedures** include plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and dental care, which are often available at a lower cost than in other European countries.\n- **Accredited hospitals** such as the Clinic of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery and the Euroclinic offer high-quality medical care and are popular with medical tourists.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many medical procedures available at a lower cost than in other European countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, dial 112 to reach emergency services, which are available 24/7.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with modern ambulances and well-trained paramedics available in most areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a mapping app, and many hospitals have emergency departments that are open 24/7.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted as soon as possible after an emergency, and travelers should keep receipts and documentation for any medical expenses.\n- **Language** can be a barrier in emergency situations, but many medical professionals speak some English, and interpreters may be available in some areas.",
