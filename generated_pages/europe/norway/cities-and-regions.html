        <h2>How Norway Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Norway is divided into 19 counties (fylker), which are further divided into 428 municipalities (kommuner). The counties are responsible for providing various public services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation, while the municipalities handle local affairs, including zoning, waste management, and cultural events. This administrative structure allows for a balance of power between the central government and local authorities, enabling Norway to maintain its unique cultural identity and regional characteristics.</p>
        <p>The country's geography also plays a significant role in its division, with the fjords, mountains, and forests creating natural boundaries between regions. The eastern part of Norway borders Sweden, while the northern part shares a border with Finland and Russia. This diverse geography has contributed to the development of distinct regional cultures, each with its own traditions, dialects, and customs.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Norway has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and ferries connecting the major cities and regions. The country's rugged terrain and limited road network make air travel a convenient option for long-distance travel, with several domestic airlines operating flights between the major cities. The train network is also well-developed, with scenic routes like the Flåm Railway and the Bergen Railway offering stunning views of the fjords and mountains. Bus services are also available, with several companies operating routes between the major cities and regions. Driving in Norway can be challenging, especially in the winter months, due to the country's rugged terrain and limited road network. However, the scenic routes and stunning natural beauty make it a popular option for those who enjoy driving.</p>
        <p>For visitors, the best way to get around Norway depends on their budget, time constraints, and personal preferences. Domestic flights are a convenient option for long-distance travel, while trains and buses offer a more scenic and affordable alternative. Renting a car can be a good option for those who want to explore the countryside and enjoy the scenic routes, but it's essential to be prepared for the country's rugged terrain and limited road network.
