[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Norway is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **grunnskole**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 16 and lasts for 10 years. Secondary education, or **videregående skole**, is not compulsory but is highly recommended, and students can choose from a variety of programs, including vocational training and academic programs that prepare them for higher education. Tertiary education, or **høgskole** or **universitet**, is offered at universities and colleges, and students can pursue a wide range of fields, including **engineering**, **business**, and **humanities**.

The quality of education in Norway is generally very high, with a strong emphasis on public education and a high level of government funding. Most schools in Norway are public, and private schools are relatively rare. The education system is also highly decentralized, with a significant amount of autonomy given to local schools and municipalities. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and innovation in the education system, and has contributed to Norway's strong reputation for educational excellence.

In terms of quality, Norway's education system is highly regarded, with students consistently scoring high on international tests such as the **Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)**. The system is also highly equitable, with a strong emphasis on providing equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. However, like all education systems, Norway's system is not without its challenges, and there are ongoing debates about issues such as **teacher training**, **curriculum reform**, and **equity and inclusion**.
