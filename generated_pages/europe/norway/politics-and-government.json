The **monarch** serves as the head of state, but their powers are largely ceremonial. The Storting is a unicameral legislature, consisting of 169 members who are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **separation of powers** is ensured by the division of power between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.\n\nThe political system in Norway is characterized by a strong emphasis on **consensus** and **cooperation** between different political parties. The government is often formed by a coalition of parties, and the prime minister must maintain the support of the Storting to remain in office. This system has contributed to Norway's reputation for stability and **good governance**.\n\nNorway's **unitary system** means that the central government has a high degree of control over the country's regions and municipalities.
