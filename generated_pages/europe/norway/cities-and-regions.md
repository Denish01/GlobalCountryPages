[SECTION] How Norway Is Divided [/SECTION]
Norway is divided into 19 counties (fylker), which are further divided into 428 municipalities (kommuner). The counties are responsible for providing various public services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation, while the municipalities handle local affairs, including zoning, waste management, and cultural events. This administrative structure allows for a balance of power between the central government and local authorities, enabling Norway to maintain its unique cultural identity and regional characteristics.

The country's geography also plays a significant role in its division, with the fjords, mountains, and forests creating natural boundaries between regions. The eastern part of Norway borders Sweden, while the northern part shares a border with Finland and Russia. This diverse geography has contributed to the development of distinct regional cultures, each with its own traditions, dialects, and customs.
