The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the **temperate** zone in the southwest, the **continental** zone in the east, and the **arctic** zone in the north. The temperate zone has mild winters and cool summers, while the continental zone has cold winters and warm summers, and the arctic zone has long, cold winters and short, cool summers.
