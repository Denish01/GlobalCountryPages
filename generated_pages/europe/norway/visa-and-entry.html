        <h2>Visa Policy Overview</h2>
        <p>Norway has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens from many countries to enter without a visa. As a member of the Schengen Area, Norway follows the common visa policy, which enables visa-free travel for citizens of 62 countries. These countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and many European nations. Citizens of these countries can stay in Norway for up to 90 days within a 180-day period without a visa. However, it's essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it's always best to check with the official Norwegian embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information.</p>
        <p>The Norwegian government has implemented various measures to ensure the smooth entry and stay of foreign nationals. For instance, the country has introduced an online application system for visas, making it easier for applicants to submit their requests. Additionally, Norway has a well-organized system for handling asylum and refugee applications, ensuring that those in need of protection can seek it in a fair and efficient manner.</p>
