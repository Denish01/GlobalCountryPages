[SECTION] Overview: Norway vs Sweden [/SECTION]
Norway and Sweden are both Nordic countries with high standards of living, but they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Norway's economy is driven by its large oil reserves, which contributes to its high GDP per capita. In contrast, Sweden has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on technology, design, and innovation. As a result, Norway tends to be more expensive than Sweden, particularly when it comes to housing, food, and transportation. However, both countries offer high-quality public services, education, and healthcare, making them attractive destinations for expats, students, and families.

The cost of living difference between Norway and Sweden is significant, with Norway being around 10-20% more expensive than Sweden. This is largely due to Norway's high taxes, which are used to fund its comprehensive social welfare system. Additionally, Norway's remote location and limited competition in certain industries contribute to higher prices for goods and services. Despite these differences, both countries offer a unique and high-quality lifestyle, with stunning natural beauty, vibrant cities, and a strong sense of community.
