[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The Norwegian education system is known for its high quality and emphasis on equal access to education for all. Public education in Norway is free or heavily subsidized, and the quality is generally excellent, with a strong focus on **social equity** and **critical thinking**. The language of instruction is Norwegian, but many schools also offer **English language instruction**, particularly at the secondary and university levels. Compulsory education in Norway lasts for 10 years, from age 6 to 16, and is divided into primary and secondary education. International schools are available in larger cities, such as Oslo and Bergen, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate (IB)** and **British GCSE**.

The Norwegian education system is designed to be inclusive and student-centered, with a focus on **project-based learning** and **student autonomy**. This approach is reflected in the country's high ranking in international education assessments, such as the **Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)**. Private education in Norway is also available, but it is not as widespread as public education, and the quality can vary depending on the institution. International schools, on the other hand, offer a range of curricula and are often popular with expat families.
