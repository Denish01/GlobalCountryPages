Compulsory education in Norway lasts for 10 years, from age 6 to 16, and is divided into primary and secondary education. International schools are available in larger cities, such as Oslo and Bergen, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate (IB)** and **British GCSE**.\n\nThe Norwegian education system is designed to be inclusive and student-centered, with a focus on **project-based learning** and **student autonomy**.
