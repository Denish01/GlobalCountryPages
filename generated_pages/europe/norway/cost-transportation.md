[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Norway has a well-developed transportation system, with a range of options available for getting around, including public transportation, taxis, ride-hailing services, and car rentals. The quality of public transit in Norway is generally high, with efficient and reliable bus, train, and metro services available in most cities. Most people in Norway use a combination of public transportation and cycling or walking to get around, with many cities having dedicated bike lanes and pedestrianized areas.

The country's rugged terrain and harsh climate can make transportation challenging, particularly in rural areas, but the government has invested heavily in infrastructure to improve road and rail links. As a result, Norway has a comprehensive network of roads, buses, and trains that make it easy to get around, even in remote areas. In addition, many cities in Norway have introduced **congestion charges** and **low-emission zones** to reduce traffic and encourage the use of public transportation.
