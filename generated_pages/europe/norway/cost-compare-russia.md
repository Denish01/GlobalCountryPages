[SECTION] Overview: Norway vs Russia [/SECTION]
Norway and Russia are two countries with vastly different economic contexts, resulting in significant variations in their cost of living. Norway, with its high GDP per capita and strong economy, has a relatively high cost of living, while Russia, with its more modest GDP per capita, has a lower cost of living. The difference in costs between the two countries can be attributed to factors such as the cost of labor, taxes, and the overall standard of living. On average, Russia is around 30-40% cheaper than Norway, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Norway's economy is driven by its oil and gas industry, which has led to a high standard of living and a strong currency. In contrast, Russia's economy is more diversified, with a significant focus on manufacturing, agriculture, and energy. This diversification has helped to keep costs lower in Russia, making it a more attractive option for those looking for a more affordable lifestyle. However, it's essential to note that the cost of living in both countries can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Oslo and Moscow being more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.
