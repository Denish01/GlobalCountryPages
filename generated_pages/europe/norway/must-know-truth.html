        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Norway has a complex and fascinating history that spans over 1,000 years. The country was first inhabited by various <strong>Germanic tribes</strong> during the <strong>Viking Age</strong> (793-1066 CE). In 872 CE, King <strong>Harald Fairhair</strong> unified the country, marking the beginning of the <strong>Norwegian Kingdom</strong>. Over the centuries, Norway was influenced by various European powers, including the <strong>Danish</strong> and <strong>Swedish</strong> kingdoms. In 1814, Norway adopted its own <strong>constitution</strong>, which declared the country's independence from Denmark. However, it was not until 1905 that Norway gained full independence from Sweden, with <strong>Haakon VII</strong> becoming the country's first king.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Middle Ages</strong> saw the rise of the <strong>Hanseatic League</strong>, a powerful trading federation that dominated Norway's economy. The country's strategic location made it an important hub for trade and commerce. In the 16th century, Norway became a <strong>protestant</strong> country, following the <strong>Reformation</strong>. This had a significant impact on the country's culture and society. Throughout its history, Norway has been classified as a <strong>sovereign state</strong>, with its own government and institutions.</p>
        <p>Norway's <strong>industrialization</strong> began in the late 19th century, with the country experiencing rapid economic growth. The <strong>20th century</strong> saw Norway play an important role in international affairs, including its participation in <strong>World War II</strong>. The country's resistance movement, led by <strong>King Haakon VII</strong>, played a significant role in the war effort. Today, Norway is a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> and a <strong>member of the United Nations</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's history has been marked by various <strong>classifications</strong>, including its status as a <strong>Nordic country</strong> and a <strong>European</strong> nation. Norway has also been classified as a <strong>high-income economy</strong>, with a strong focus on <strong>social welfare</strong> and <strong>human rights</strong>. The country's history has been shaped by its <strong>geography</strong>, with its rugged landscape and harsh climate influencing the development of its culture and society.</p>
