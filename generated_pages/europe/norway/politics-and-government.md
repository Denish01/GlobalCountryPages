[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Norway is based on the principles of **parliamentarism**, where the **prime minister** is the head of government and is accountable to the **Storting**, the national parliament. The **monarch** serves as the head of state, but their powers are largely ceremonial. The Storting is a unicameral legislature, consisting of 169 members who are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **separation of powers** is ensured by the division of power between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.

The political system in Norway is characterized by a strong emphasis on **consensus** and **cooperation** between different political parties. The government is often formed by a coalition of parties, and the prime minister must maintain the support of the Storting to remain in office. This system has contributed to Norway's reputation for stability and **good governance**.

Norway's **unitary system** means that the central government has a high degree of control over the country's regions and municipalities. However, there are also **local governments** that have a degree of autonomy and are responsible for providing various public services.
