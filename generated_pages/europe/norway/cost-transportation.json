The quality of public transit in Norway is generally high, with efficient and reliable bus, train, and metro services available in most cities. Most people in Norway use a combination of public transportation and cycling or walking to get around, with many cities having dedicated bike lanes and pedestrianized areas.\n\nThe country's rugged terrain and harsh climate can make transportation challenging, particularly in rural areas, but the government has invested heavily in infrastructure to improve road and rail links. As a result, Norway has a comprehensive network of roads, buses, and trains that make it easy to get around, even in remote areas. In addition, many cities in Norway have introduced **congestion charges** and **low-emission zones** to reduce traffic and encourage the use of public transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $3.50 | $95 | Good coverage in cities like Oslo and Bergen |\n| Metro / Subway | $3.50 | $95 | Available in Oslo and Bergen |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | $6-$10 | $150 | Available in major cities, with frequent services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $10 | $2.50 | $15-$25 | Available in all cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5 | $1.50 | $10-$20 | Uber and Bolt available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $60-$100 | To city center, depending on the airport and city |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $2.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $2.20 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-$100 | Economy car, depending on the rental company and location |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $5-$10 | |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Some roads, particularly tunnels and bridges, have tolls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Available on many routes, with companies like Vy and FlixBus |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$250 | Typical route, e.g., Oslo to Bergen |\n| Train (long-distance) | $50-$150 | Available on some routes, with **night trains** available on certain routes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider purchasing a **rechargeable public transportation card** to save money on single fares.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Uber or Bolt to get around cities, as they are often cheaper than taxis.\n- Be aware of **congestion charges** and **low-emission zones** in cities, which may affect your transportation costs.\n- Negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before you start your journey, especially for longer trips.\n- Use **parking apps** to find and pay for parking in cities, as it can be difficult to find parking spots.\n- Consider **car sharing** or **car rental** for longer trips or rural areas, as public transportation may be limited.",
