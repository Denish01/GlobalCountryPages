  "content": "Norway is generally more expensive than Sweden, with an overall cost of living difference of around 10-20% between the two countries.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nNorway GDP per Capita (PPP): $70,591\nSweden GDP per Capita (PPP): $54,960\nNorway Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nSweden Inflation Rate: 1.8%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Sweden\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Norway vs Sweden [/SECTION]\nNorway and Sweden are both Nordic countries with high standards of living, but they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Norway's economy is driven by its large oil reserves, which contributes to its high GDP per capita. In contrast, Sweden has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on technology, design, and innovation. As a result, Norway tends to be more expensive than Sweden, particularly when it comes to housing, food, and transportation. However, both countries offer high-quality public services, education, and healthcare, making them attractive destinations for expats, students, and families.\n\nThe cost of living difference between Norway and Sweden is significant, with Norway being around 10-20% more expensive than Sweden. This is largely due to Norway's high taxes, which are used to fund its comprehensive social welfare system. Additionally, Norway's remote location and limited competition in certain industries contribute to higher prices for goods and services. Despite these differences, both countries offer a unique and high-quality lifestyle, with stunning natural beauty, vibrant cities, and a strong sense of community.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Norway (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $1,800 | $1,400 | 29% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $1,200 | $900 | 33% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $3,500 | $2,800 | 25% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Norway (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $25 | $20 | 25% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $800 | $600 | 33% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | $8 | $6 | 33% more |\n| Coffee | $5 | $4 | 25% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Norway (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $100 | $80 | 25% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2.50 | $2.00 | 25% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.80 | $1.50 | 20% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Norway (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $200 | $150 | 33% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $40 | 25% more |\n| Mobile Plan | $30 | $25 | 20% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Norway (USD) | Sweden (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $2,500 | $2,000 | 20% |\n| Mid-Range | $3,500 | $2,800 | 20% |\n| Comfortable | $5,000 | $4,000 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Norway is cheaper for:**\n- Skiing and winter sports equipment, due to its proximity to world-class ski resorts\n- Fresh seafood, with a wide variety of fish and shellfish available at local markets\n- Hiking and outdoor gear, with many specialty stores offering high-quality equipment\n- Luxury goods, with several high-end brands available in major cities\n- **Sweden is cheaper for:**\n- Electronics and gadgets, with several large retailers offering competitive prices\n- Furniture and home decor, with IKEA and other Swedish brands offering affordable options\n- Public transportation, with a well-developed and efficient system\n- Dining out, with a wide range of affordable restaurants and cafes\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Norway and Sweden, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle and priorities.
