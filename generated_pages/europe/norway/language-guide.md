[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Norway is characterized by two main forms of the Norwegian language: **Bokmål** and **Nynorsk**. Bokmål is the most widely used form, and it is the language taught in most schools. Nynorsk, on the other hand, is used by around 10-15% of the population, mainly in the western and central regions of the country. There are also several regional dialects, such as **Trøndersk** and **Bergensk**, which can be quite different from the standard language. In addition to Norwegian, many Norwegians speak English as a second language, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry.

Norway is also home to several minority languages, including **Sami**, which is spoken by the indigenous Sami people in the northern parts of the country. Other minority languages include **Kven** and **Tavringer**, which are spoken by smaller groups of people. Despite the existence of these minority languages, Norwegian is the dominant language used in most aspects of Norwegian life, including education, government, and media.

English is widely understood in Norway, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry. Many Norwegians start learning English in school from a young age, and it is common for Norwegians to speak English as a second language. This makes it relatively easy for tourists and visitors to communicate with locals, even if they do not speak Norwegian. However, it is still a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in Norwegian, as this can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people.
