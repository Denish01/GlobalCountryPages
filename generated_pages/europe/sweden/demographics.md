[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Sweden's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but it has been steadily growing over the past few decades due to a combination of natural increase and net migration. The population growth rate is approximately 0.8% per annum, which is slightly higher than the European average. The country's urban population accounts for around 87.4% of the total population, with the majority residing in the three largest cities: Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö. Sweden has a reputation for being a welcoming and inclusive society, with a long history of immigration and a strong focus on social welfare and equality. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a moderate pace, with projections suggesting that the population will reach around 11.5 million by 2030.

The population growth in Sweden is driven by a combination of factors, including a high life expectancy, a relatively high fertility rate, and a significant influx of immigrants. The country has a well-developed social welfare system, which provides a high level of healthcare, education, and social services to its citizens. This, combined with a strong economy and a high standard of living, makes Sweden an attractive destination for people from around the world. However, the country also faces challenges related to population growth, including pressure on housing, transportation, and public services, particularly in urban areas.

Sweden's urbanization trend is evident in the fact that the majority of the population lives in urban areas, with many people relocating from rural areas to cities in search of better job opportunities, education, and cultural experiences. The country's rural areas, however, still maintain a strong sense of community and identity, with many people preserving traditional ways of life and cultural practices. The government has implemented policies to support rural development and promote sustainable growth in these areas, recognizing the importance of preserving the country's natural heritage and cultural diversity.
