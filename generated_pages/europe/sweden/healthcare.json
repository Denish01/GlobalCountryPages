The system is divided into three main levels: primary care, specialist care, and hospital care. Primary care is usually the first point of contact for patients, and it is provided by **public health centers** and private practices. Specialist care and hospital care are provided by **hospitals** and **specialist clinics**. The quality of care in Sweden is generally very high, with well-trained medical staff and modern equipment. However, there can be differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas tend to have more specialized care and better-equipped hospitals.\n\nThe Swedish healthcare system is also known for its strong focus on **preventive care**, with regular check-ups and screenings for diseases such as cancer and diabetes. The system is also highly **digitized**, with electronic health records and online appointment booking systems. This makes it easy for patients to access their medical records and communicate with their healthcare providers. Despite the many strengths of the Swedish healthcare system, there can be **long waiting times** for non-emergency procedures, and some patients may experience **delays** in getting appointments with specialist doctors.\n\nOverall, Sweden's healthcare system is considered one of the best in the world, with a strong emphasis on providing high-quality, accessible care to all citizens. The system is well-funded and well-organized, with a strong focus on preventive care and patient-centered care. However, there are some challenges, such as long waiting times and limited access to specialized care in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Karolinska University Hospital | Stockholm | University Hospital | Cancer, cardiology, neurology | Yes |\n| Sahlgrenska University Hospital | Gothenburg | University Hospital | Orthopedics, pediatrics, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Skåne University Hospital | Malmö | University Hospital | Oncology, cardiology, gastroenterology | Yes |\n| Danderyd Hospital | Stockholm | General Hospital | Emergency care, surgery, internal medicine | Yes |\n| Uppsala University Hospital | Uppsala | University Hospital | Neurosurgery, orthopedics, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Örebro University Hospital | Örebro | University Hospital | Cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Public health insurance** is available to all Swedish citizens and covers a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions.\n- **Private health insurance** is also available and can provide additional coverage for services such as dental care and physiotherapy.\n- **Expats** and **foreign visitors** may be eligible for public health insurance if they are working or studying in Sweden, but may also want to consider purchasing private health insurance to cover any gaps in coverage.\n- **Costs** for health insurance vary depending on the type of insurance and the individual's circumstances, but are generally considered to be reasonable.\n- **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)** holders are also entitled to medical care in Sweden, but may need to pay for some services out-of-pocket.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors to Sweden, as it can provide coverage for unexpected medical expenses and travel-related emergencies.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in Sweden and can be purchased at **public pharmacies** or **private pharmacies**.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also widely available and can be purchased at pharmacies or **convenience stores**.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available in Sweden, including international brands and generic alternatives.\n- **Costs** for medications vary depending on the type of medication and the individual's insurance coverage, but are generally considered to be reasonable.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but generally require a prescription from a licensed doctor or other healthcare provider.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Recommended vaccinations** for travel to Sweden include measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), as well as tetanus and diphtheria.\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Sweden include none, but visitors may need to show proof of vaccination for certain diseases such as yellow fever if they are coming from a high-risk area.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Sweden include influenza and norovirus, which can be prevalent during the winter months.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Sweden, with tap water being safe to drink in most areas.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good in Sweden, with a strong emphasis on food hygiene and handling practices.\n- **Other health risks** in Sweden include the risk of tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Sweden include orthopedic surgery, cosmetic surgery, and fertility treatments.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Sweden include the Karolinska University Hospital and the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, which offer a range of medical services to international patients.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists in Sweden, particularly for procedures such as orthopedic surgery and cosmetic surgery.\n- **Language** is generally not a barrier for medical tourists in Sweden, as many healthcare providers speak English fluently.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a **medical emergency**, dial 112 to reach emergency services.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good in Sweden, with a fast response time and well-equipped ambulances.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by searching online or contacting the local health authority.\n- **Insurance claims** can be submitted to the patient's insurance provider, and may require documentation such as medical records and receipts.\n- **Emergency room care** is generally of high quality in Sweden, with well-trained medical staff and modern equipment.",
