  "content": "To determine if you need a visa for Sweden, it is essential to check the specific requirements based on your nationality and the purpose of your visit.\n\n[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Sweden before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nSweden has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter the country without a visa or with a visa on arrival. As a member of the European Union and the Schengen Area, Sweden follows the common visa policy of the EU, which provides visa-free access to citizens of 62 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, for stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. This policy allows for a relatively liberal approach to visa requirements, making it easier for tourists, business travelers, and other visitors to enter the country.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel and trade with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration. As a result, citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access must apply for a visa at a Swedish embassy or consulate before their trip. The type of visa required depends on the purpose and duration of the stay, with different requirements for tourists, business travelers, students, and workers.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Visa-free access as part of the US Visa Waiver Program |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Visa-free access as part of the EU's common visa policy |\n| EU Citizens | No | Free Movement | Unrestricted | As members of the EU, citizens have the right to free movement within the EU |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Visa-free access as part of the Canadian Visa Waiver Program |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Visa-free access as part of the Australian Visa Waiver Program |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for a Schengen visa at a Swedish embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for a Schengen visa at a Swedish embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists from eligible countries can enter Sweden without a visa and stay for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.
