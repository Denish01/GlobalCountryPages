[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Sweden has a **worldwide taxation** system, meaning that residents are taxed on their global income, regardless of where it's earned. However, non-residents are only taxed on their Swedish-sourced income. To be considered a tax resident in Sweden, an individual must have a permanent home in the country, be registered in the Swedish population register, or have been present in Sweden for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. The tax authority, Skatteverket, determines an individual's tax residency status based on their circumstances.

The Swedish tax system is known for its complexity, with various deductions and allowances available to taxpayers. The tax year in Sweden runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by May 4th of each year. Sweden has a comprehensive tax treaty network, with agreements in place to avoid double taxation and fiscal evasion with over 90 countries. This network helps to reduce the tax burden on individuals and businesses with international connections.
