The market is characterized by a mix of old and new properties, with a focus on modern, energy-efficient buildings in urban areas. The price trajectory has been upward, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per year in the past decade. However, the market is showing signs of slowing down, with prices stabilizing in some areas. Urban areas, such as Stockholm and Gothenburg, tend to be more expensive than rural areas, where prices are generally lower.\n\nThe Swedish government has implemented various measures to control the market, including rent controls and restrictions on short-term rentals. Despite these measures, the market remains attractive to investors, with a relatively high rental yield and a stable economy. The demand for housing is driven by a growing population, with many young people moving to urban areas for work and education.\n\nThe market is also influenced by the country's strong focus on sustainability and environmental issues. Many new buildings are designed with energy efficiency in mind, and there is a growing demand for **eco-friendly** and **sustainable** properties. This trend is expected to continue, with the government setting ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions and promoting green growth.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stockholm City | $6,300 | $2,500 | Apartment |\n| Gothenburg | $4,500 | $1,800 | Apartment |\n| Malmö | $3,800 | $1,500 | Apartment |\n| Uppsala | $3,200 | $1,200 | House |\n| Västerås | $2,800 | $1,000 | House |\n| Rural Areas | $1,500 | $600 | House |\n| Östermalm, Stockholm | $8,000 | $3,500 | Luxury Apartment |\n| Södermalm, Stockholm | $7,000 | $3,000 | Luxury Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- There are no restrictions on foreign ownership of property in Sweden, and foreigners can buy, sell, and own real estate without any special permits or licenses.\n- However, foreigners may need to obtain a **tax identification number** and register with the Swedish Tax Agency to pay taxes on their property.\n- Foreign companies can also own property in Sweden, but they may need to register with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and obtain a **Swedish organization number**.\n- Foreigners who are not resident in Sweden may need to appoint a **power of attorney** to manage their property and handle transactions.\n- Foreigners should also be aware of the **inheritance tax** and **gift tax** rules in Sweden, which may apply to property transfers.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
