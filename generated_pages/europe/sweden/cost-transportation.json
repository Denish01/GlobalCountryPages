The country's capital, Stockholm, has a comprehensive network of buses, trams, and metro lines, making it easy to get around without a car. In fact, many Swedes prefer to use public transportation, cycle, or walk, as it is often faster and more convenient than driving. The quality of public transit in Sweden is generally high, with frequent and reliable services, although prices can be steep for visitors.\n\nMost people in Sweden get around using public transportation, with many cities having their own systems. The **public transportation** network is well-integrated, allowing for easy travel between cities and towns. In addition to public transportation, many Swedes also use **ride-hailing apps** or **taxis** to get around, especially at night or in areas with limited public transportation.
