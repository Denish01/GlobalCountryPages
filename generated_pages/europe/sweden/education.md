[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The Swedish education system is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. **Primary education**, also known as grundskola, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 16 and lasts for 10 years. The primary education system is designed to provide students with a broad-based education, including subjects such as Swedish, mathematics, science, and social studies. After completing primary education, students can choose to attend **secondary school**, also known as gymnasium, which is not compulsory but is required for those who wish to pursue higher education. Secondary school typically lasts for three years and provides students with more specialized education in their chosen field. **Tertiary education**, which includes university and college education, is also available to students who have completed secondary school. The quality of education in Sweden is generally high, with a strong emphasis on providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen careers.

However, there are also a number of **private schools** available, which are often specialized and may have different curricula and teaching methods.

In addition to the public education system, Sweden also has a number of **independent schools**, which are privately funded but still subject to government regulations and standards.

Overall, the Swedish education system is designed to provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in their chosen careers. The system is highly regarded and has been the subject of study by educators and policymakers from around the world.
