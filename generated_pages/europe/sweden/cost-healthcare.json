  "content": "In Sweden, the cost of healthcare is relatively high, with a health expenditure per capita of $6,485, but the country's universal healthcare system ensures that everyone has access to quality medical care, regardless of income level.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $6,485\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 13.4%\nHealthcare System: Universal\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: No\nCurrency: SEK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSweden's healthcare system is primarily public, with a strong emphasis on universal access to healthcare services. The system is funded through taxes and government subsidies, and everyone is covered, including foreigners who are registered with the Swedish authorities. Public healthcare services are generally of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. Private healthcare services are also available, but they are not as widely used as public services. For locals, the system works seamlessly, with most medical services being free or low-cost. For foreigners, the system can be a bit more complex, but most hospitals and medical centers have English-speaking staff and can provide assistance with language and other issues.\n\nThe Swedish healthcare system is designed to provide comprehensive care to all citizens, regardless of income level. The system is divided into three levels: primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by local health centers and clinics, which offer basic medical services such as check-ups, vaccinations, and prescriptions. Secondary care is provided by hospitals and specialized clinics, which offer more advanced medical services such as surgeries and diagnostic tests. Tertiary care is provided by specialized hospitals and research centers, which offer highly specialized medical services such as organ transplants and cancer treatment. Foreigners who are not registered with the Swedish authorities may need to purchase private health insurance to access medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Public clinics may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $200-$500 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times for non-emergency procedures |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $150-$300 | Public dental clinics may have limited services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Public eye clinics may have limited services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have longer wait times for test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times for non-emergency cases |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Public hospitals may have shared rooms and limited amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times for non-emergency procedures |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Public hospitals may have limited private rooms and amenities |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times for non-emergency procedures |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Public clinics may have limited services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, and basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | All medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Emergency medical evacuations, repatriation, and other international medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally subsidized by the government, with costs ranging from $5 to $20 per prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 per item.\n- Pharmacy services are widely available, with many pharmacies open 24 hours a day.\n- Prescription rules are strict, with most medications requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics are widely available, but may require a prescription.\n- Medication prices vary by pharmacy and location, with prices in larger cities tend to be higher.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, call the emergency number 112, which is available 24 hours a day.
