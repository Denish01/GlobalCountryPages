[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Swedish cuisine is characterized by its simplicity, freshness, and emphasis on local ingredients. The country's unique geography, with its vast forests, lakes, and coastline, has shaped its culinary traditions. **Seafood**, such as salmon, cod, and herring, is a staple in Swedish cuisine, particularly in coastal regions. The country's **meatballs**, made from a mixture of beef and pork, are also a beloved national dish. Swedish cuisine has been influenced by its neighboring countries, such as Norway and Denmark, as well as by its history of immigration and trade. Regional variations in Swedish cuisine include the **Västerbottensost** cheese from the north, the **Skånska** sausage from the south, and the **Smörgåsbord** buffet from the east.

The concept of **Lagom**, which means "not too little, not too much, but just right," is also central to Swedish food culture. This philosophy emphasizes the importance of balance and moderation in all aspects of life, including eating. As a result, Swedish cuisine tends to be hearty and comforting, with a focus on simple, locally sourced ingredients. In recent years, Swedish cuisine has also become known for its innovative and experimental approach, with many restaurants incorporating **foraging** and **wild foods** into their menus.

Sweden's food culture is also closely tied to its social culture, with **mealtimes** often serving as opportunities for socializing and community-building. The traditional Swedish **fika**, or coffee break, is an example of this, where friends and colleagues gather to enjoy coffee, pastries, and conversation.
