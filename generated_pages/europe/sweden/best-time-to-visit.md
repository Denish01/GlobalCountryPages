[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Sweden has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, each with its own unique characteristics. The country can be divided into three climate zones: the southern region has a milder climate, the central region has a more continental climate, and the northern region has a subarctic climate. The dry season in Sweden typically occurs during the winter months, from December to February, while the wet season occurs during the summer months, from June to August. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Sweden, with the summer months being the best time to visit for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and swimming, while the winter months are better suited for indoor activities such as visiting museums and shopping.

The summer solstice, which occurs in June, is a special time in Sweden, with the midnight sun visible in the northern parts of the country. The winter solstice, which occurs in December, is a time of short days and cold weather, but it is also a time of festive atmosphere and holiday celebrations. The spring and autumn seasons are also great times to visit Sweden, with mild weather and beautiful scenery, making them ideal for outdoor activities such as cycling and kayaking.

The climate in Sweden varies greatly depending on the region, with the northern parts of the country experiencing colder temperatures and more snowfall than the southern parts. The western coast of Sweden, which borders the Atlantic Ocean, has a milder climate than the eastern coast, which borders the Baltic Sea. The mountainous regions of Sweden, such as the Scandinavian Mountains, have a harsher climate than the low-lying areas, with colder temperatures and more snowfall.
