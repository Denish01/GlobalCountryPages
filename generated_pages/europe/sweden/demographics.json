  "content": "Sweden is home to a diverse population of approximately 10.5 million people, with a unique blend of indigenous and immigrant communities, urban and rural dwellers, and a range of ethnic and religious groups.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 10.5 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.8%\nMedian Age: 41.9 years\nUrban Population: 87.4%\nPopulation Density: 23.5 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 82.4 years\nFertility Rate: 1.85 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nSweden's population size is relatively small compared to other European countries, but it has been steadily growing over the past few decades due to a combination of natural increase and net migration. The population growth rate is approximately 0.8% per annum, which is slightly higher than the European average. The country's urban population accounts for around 87.4% of the total population, with the majority residing in the three largest cities: Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö. Sweden has a reputation for being a welcoming and inclusive society, with a long history of immigration and a strong focus on social welfare and equality. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a moderate pace, with projections suggesting that the population will reach around 11.5 million by 2030.\n\nThe population growth in Sweden is driven by a combination of factors, including a high life expectancy, a relatively high fertility rate, and a significant influx of immigrants. The country has a well-developed social welfare system, which provides a high level of healthcare, education, and social services to its citizens. This, combined with a strong economy and a high standard of living, makes Sweden an attractive destination for people from around the world. However, the country also faces challenges related to population growth, including pressure on housing, transportation, and public services, particularly in urban areas.\n\nSweden's urbanization trend is evident in the fact that the majority of the population lives in urban areas, with many people relocating from rural areas to cities in search of better job opportunities, education, and cultural experiences. The country's rural areas, however, still maintain a strong sense of community and identity, with many people preserving traditional ways of life and cultural practices. The government has implemented policies to support rural development and promote sustainable growth in these areas, recognizing the importance of preserving the country's natural heritage and cultural diversity.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Swedes | 80-85% | Throughout the country | Indigenous population |\n| Finns | 2-3% | Northern and eastern regions | Largest immigrant group in the 1950s-1960s |\n| Sami | 0.1-0.2% | Northern regions | Indigenous people with their own language and culture |\n| Kurds | 1-2% | Urban areas | Immigrant group from Turkey, Iraq, and Iran |\n| Somalis | 0.5-1% | Urban areas | Refugee group from Somalia |\n| Arabs | 1-2% | Urban areas | Immigrant group from various Arab countries |\n| Assyrians/Syriacs | 0.5-1% | Urban areas | Immigrant group from the Middle East |\n[/TABLE]\nSweden is a multicultural society with a diverse range of ethnic groups, including indigenous Swedes, Finns, Sami, and immigrant communities from around the world. The country has a long history of immigration, with people arriving from Finland, Norway, and other parts of Europe in the past, and more recently from countries such as Somalia, Iraq, and Syria. The ethnic groups in Sweden maintain their own languages, cultures, and traditions, and the country has a strong focus on promoting diversity and inclusion. However, there are also challenges related to integration, social cohesion, and addressing discrimination and racism.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Swedish** is the official language and the most widely spoken language in the country, with around 90% of the population speaking it as their first language.\n- Regional languages, such as **Finnish** and **Sami**, are also recognized and protected by the government.\n- **English** is widely spoken, particularly among the younger population and in urban areas, and is often used as a lingua franca in business and tourism.\n- **Arabic** and **Kurdish** are also spoken by significant immigrant communities.\n- **Romani** is an endangered language spoken by the Romani people, a minority group that has faced historical persecution and discrimination.\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lutheranism | 57-60% | Official state church until 2000 |\n| No affiliation | 20-25% | Growing trend of secularism |\n| Islam | 8-10% | Largest minority religion |\n| Catholicism | 1-2% | Growing immigrant community |\n| Orthodox Christianity | 1-2% | Immigrant communities from Eastern Europe and the Middle East |\n| Other | 1-2% | Includes Buddhism, Hinduism, and other minority religions |\n[/TABLE]\nSweden is a secular country with a long history of religious freedom and tolerance.
