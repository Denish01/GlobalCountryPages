[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Sweden's healthcare system is primarily public, with a strong emphasis on universal access to healthcare services. The system is funded through taxes and government subsidies, and everyone is covered, including foreigners who are registered with the Swedish authorities. Public healthcare services are generally of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. Private healthcare services are also available, but they are not as widely used as public services. For locals, the system works seamlessly, with most medical services being free or low-cost. For foreigners, the system can be a bit more complex, but most hospitals and medical centers have English-speaking staff and can provide assistance with language and other issues.

The Swedish healthcare system is designed to provide comprehensive care to all citizens, regardless of income level. The system is divided into three levels: primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by local health centers and clinics, which offer basic medical services such as check-ups, vaccinations, and prescriptions. Secondary care is provided by hospitals and specialized clinics, which offer more advanced medical services such as surgeries and diagnostic tests. Tertiary care is provided by specialized hospitals and research centers, which offer highly specialized medical services such as organ transplants and cancer treatment. Foreigners who are not registered with the Swedish authorities may need to purchase private health insurance to access medical care.
