[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Sweden is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on **equity** and **inclusivity**. Public education is free or heavily subsidized, and the quality is generally high, with well-trained teachers and modern facilities. However, some parents may choose to send their children to private schools, which can offer smaller class sizes and more individualized attention. The language of instruction is Swedish, but many schools also teach English and other languages. Compulsory education lasts for 10 years, from age 7 to 16, and is divided into primary and secondary school. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Stockholm, which offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the British GCSE.

The Swedish education system is designed to be student-centered, with a focus on **critical thinking** and **problem-solving**. Students are encouraged to take an active role in their learning, and teachers act as facilitators rather than lecturers. The system is also highly decentralized, with schools having a significant amount of autonomy to design their own curricula and teaching methods. This approach has contributed to Sweden's high ranking in international education rankings, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).
