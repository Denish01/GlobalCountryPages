The country's unique geography, with its vast forests, lakes, and coastline, has shaped its culinary traditions. **Seafood**, such as salmon, cod, and herring, is a staple in Swedish cuisine, particularly in coastal regions. The country's **meatballs**, made from a mixture of beef and pork, are also a beloved national dish. Swedish cuisine has been influenced by its neighboring countries, such as Norway and Denmark, as well as by its history of immigration and trade. Regional variations in Swedish cuisine include the **Västerbottensost** cheese from the north, the **Skånska** sausage from the south, and the **Smörgåsbord** buffet from the east.\n\nThe concept of **Lagom**, which means \"not too little, not too much, but just right,\" is also central to Swedish food culture. This philosophy emphasizes the importance of balance and moderation in all aspects of life, including eating. As a result, Swedish cuisine tends to be hearty and comforting, with a focus on simple, locally sourced ingredients. In recent years, Swedish cuisine has also become known for its innovative and experimental approach, with many restaurants incorporating **foraging** and **wild foods** into their menus.\n\nSweden's food culture is also closely tied to its social culture, with **mealtimes** often serving as opportunities for socializing and community-building. The traditional Swedish **fika**, or coffee break, is an example of this, where friends and colleagues gather to enjoy coffee, pastries, and conversation.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Köttbullar | Main Course | Swedish Meatballs made from ground meat, served with potatoes, gravy, and lingonberry jam | Traditional restaurants in Stockholm |\n| Gravlax | Appetizer | Thinly sliced smoked salmon, served with a sweet mustard sauce | Seafood restaurants in Gothenburg |\n| Janssons Frestelse | Side Dish | Anchovy and potato casserole, often served as a side dish | Traditional restaurants in Malmö |\n| Västerbottensostpaj | Dessert | Cheesecake made with Västerbottensost cheese, served with cloudberry jam | Cafes in Umeå |\n| Räkmacka | Sandwich | Shrimp sandwich, often served with mayonnaise and lettuce | Seafood markets in Stockholm |\n| Falukorv | Sausage | Traditional Swedish sausage, often served with potatoes and vegetables | Street food vendors in Gothenburg |\n| Ärtsoppa | Soup | Yellow pea soup, often served with pork and vegetables | Traditional restaurants in Stockholm |\n| Pannkakor | Dessert | Thin pancakes, often served with jam and whipped cream | Cafes in Malmö |\n| Kanelbulle | Pastry | Cinnamon bun, often topped with sugar and almonds | Bakeries in Stockholm |\n| Prinsesstårta | Cake | Princess cake, a layered sponge cake filled with whipped cream and fruit preserves | Cafes in Gothenburg |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Korv** (hot dog) -
