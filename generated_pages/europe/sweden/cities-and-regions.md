[SECTION] How Sweden Is Divided [/SECTION]
Sweden's administrative structure is based on a system of 21 counties, each with its own county council and administrative board. These counties are further divided into municipalities, which are responsible for providing local services such as education, healthcare, and social services. The country is also divided into three main regions: Norrland, Svealand, and Götaland, each with its own unique cultural and geographical characteristics. Norrland, which covers the northern part of the country, is known for its vast forests, mountains, and natural beauty, while Svealand, which includes the capital city Stockholm, is the most populous region and home to many of Sweden's major cities. Götaland, which covers the southern part of the country, is known for its rich agricultural land and vibrant cities such as Gothenburg and Malmö.

The division of Sweden into these regions and counties has a significant impact on the country's economy, culture, and daily life. For example, the northern region of Norrland is home to many of Sweden's indigenous Sami people, who have their own distinct culture and language. The region is also rich in natural resources, including iron ore, copper, and timber, which has driven the local economy for centuries. In contrast, the southern region of Götaland is more densely populated and has a more diverse economy, with major industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and technology.
