[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Swedish property market has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by a strong economy, low interest rates, and a shortage of housing supply. The market is characterized by a mix of old and new properties, with a focus on modern, energy-efficient buildings in urban areas. The price trajectory has been upward, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per year in the past decade. However, the market is showing signs of slowing down, with prices stabilizing in some areas. Urban areas, such as Stockholm and Gothenburg, tend to be more expensive than rural areas, where prices are generally lower.

The Swedish government has implemented various measures to control the market, including rent controls and restrictions on short-term rentals. Despite these measures, the market remains attractive to investors, with a relatively high rental yield and a stable economy. The demand for housing is driven by a growing population, with many young people moving to urban areas for work and education.

The market is also influenced by the country's strong focus on sustainability and environmental issues. Many new buildings are designed with energy efficiency in mind, and there is a growing demand for **eco-friendly** and **sustainable** properties. This trend is expected to continue, with the government setting ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions and promoting green growth.
