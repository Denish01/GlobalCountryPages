[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Serbia is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest and most widely available. Public education is generally considered to be of good quality, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. The language of instruction is Serbian, but some schools may offer additional languages such as English, French, or German. Compulsory education in Serbia lasts for 12 years, starting from the age of 7 and ending at the age of 18. International schools are available in larger cities such as Belgrade, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and the British A-level.

The quality of private education in Serbia can vary depending on the institution, but many private schools offer a high level of education with smaller class sizes and more individualized attention. Some private schools may also offer additional amenities such as sports facilities, libraries, and computer labs. International schools in Serbia often have a more diverse student body and teaching staff, and may offer a range of extracurricular activities and programs. However, the cost of private and international education in Serbia can be prohibitively expensive for many families, with tuition fees ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.
