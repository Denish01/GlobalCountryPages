As a result, most of the country is now covered by 4G networks, and limited 5G services are available in some areas. However, the quality of the internet can still vary depending on the location and the service provider, so it's a good idea to research the best options for your specific needs.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Serbia is relatively straightforward, with several mobile providers offering a range of plans and options for tourists and locals alike.
