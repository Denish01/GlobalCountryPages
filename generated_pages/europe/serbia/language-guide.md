[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Serbia is dominated by the Serbian language, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. However, there are also several regional dialects, including the Šumadija-Vojvodina dialect, which is spoken in the northern part of the country, and the Prizren-Timok dialect, which is spoken in the southern part of the country. Minority languages, such as Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian, are also spoken in certain regions. English is widely taught in schools and is becoming increasingly popular among the younger population, but it is not as widely spoken as in some other European countries. Visitors may find that many older Serbs speak little or no English, while younger people and those in the service industry are more likely to speak some English.

In addition to Serbian, many Serbs also speak other languages, including English, German, and French. However, the use of English is not as widespread as in some other European countries, and visitors may find that they need to use a phrasebook or translation app to communicate with locals. The Cyrillic alphabet is the official script of Serbia, but the Latin alphabet is also widely used, particularly in tourist areas and among younger people.

The language family of Serbian is Slavic, which means that it is closely related to other languages such as Russian, Polish, and Czech. This can make it easier for visitors who speak one of these languages to pick up some basic Serbian phrases. However, the grammar and pronunciation of Serbian are distinct and may take some time to get used to.
