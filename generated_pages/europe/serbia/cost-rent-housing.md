[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Serbia is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are for 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have access to basic amenities such as electricity, water, and heating. Compared to regional neighbors, Serbia's housing costs are generally lower, making it an attractive option for those looking to relocate to the Balkans. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Belgrade and Novi Sad tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.

The Serbian housing market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by government investment in infrastructure and a growing economy. However, the market is still relatively underdeveloped, and renters may need to be patient and flexible when searching for a property. Many apartments and houses are owned by private individuals, and the rental market is often informal, with many landlords preferring to rent to locals rather than expats. Despite these challenges, Serbia's affordable housing costs and rich cultural heritage make it an attractive destination for those looking to experience life in the Balkans.
