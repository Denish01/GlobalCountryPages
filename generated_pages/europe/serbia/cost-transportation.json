The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent and reliable services. Most people in Serbia get around using public transportation, with buses being the most popular mode of transport. The country's capital, Belgrade, has a comprehensive public transportation network, including a bus and tram system, as well as a commuter train connecting the city to surrounding suburbs.\n\nIn addition to public transportation, many Serbians own cars, and driving is a common mode of transport, especially in rural areas where public transportation may be limited.
