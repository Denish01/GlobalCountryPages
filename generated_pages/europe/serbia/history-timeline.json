  "content": "The history of Serbia is a complex and multifaceted narrative that spans over two millennia, from the ancient **Illyrian** and **Celtic** tribes to the modern sovereign state. \n\n[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]\nThe history of Serbia began with the arrival of the **Illyrian** tribes in the 8th century BC, followed by the **Celtic** tribes in the 4th century BC. The region was later conquered by the **Roman Empire** in the 1st century BC, and after the Roman Empire's collapse, it was inhabited by various **Slavic** tribes. In the 7th century AD, the **Serbs** arrived in the region, and by the 12th century, they had established the **Medieval Serbian State**. This state reached its peak during the reign of **Stefan Nemanja** and his successors, who established the **Nemanjic dynasty**. The Serbian state was later conquered by the **Ottoman Empire** in the 14th century, and it remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 400 years.\n\nThe 19th century saw the emergence of the **Serbian Revolution**, which aimed to establish an independent Serbian state. The revolution was led by **Karadjordje Petrovic** and **Miloš Obrenović**, who played a crucial role in the country's struggle for independence. The **Congress of Berlin** in 1878 recognized Serbia as a principality, and in 1882, it became a kingdom. The 20th century was marked by two devastating world wars, during which Serbia suffered significant losses. After World War II, Serbia became a part of the **Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia**, led by **Josip Broz Tito**. With the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Serbia became an independent state once again.\n\nThe modern era has seen Serbia face numerous challenges, including the **Kosovo conflict** and the **Balkans war**. The country has also made significant progress in recent years, including its accession to the **Council of Europe** and its candidacy for **European Union** membership. Today, Serbia is a sovereign state with a diverse culture and a rich history. The country continues to work towards strengthening its economy and improving its relations with neighboring countries.\n\nThe history of Serbia is a testament to the country's resilience and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
