The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a focus on renovation and redevelopment in urban areas. Prices have been rising, particularly in the capital city of Belgrade, but remain relatively affordable compared to other European cities. The trend is expected to continue, with urban areas experiencing more rapid growth than rural areas.\n\nThe Serbian government has implemented various measures to attract foreign investment, including simplifying the buying process and offering tax incentives. This has led to an increase in demand for properties, particularly in the rental market. However, the market is still relatively underdeveloped, and buyers should be aware of the potential risks and challenges associated with investing in a emerging market.\n\nIn terms of price trajectory, the market has experienced a steady increase in prices over the past few years, with an average annual growth rate of 5-10%. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with Belgrade being the most expensive city in the country. Urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, but the latter can offer a more relaxed pace of life and a lower cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Belgrade | $1,500 | $200-300 | Apartment |\n| Novi Sad | $1,000 | $150-250 | Apartment |\n| Niš | $800 | $100-200 | Apartment |\n| Kragujevac | $600 | $80-150 | House |\n| Subotica | $500 | $60-120 | House |\n| Užice | $400 | $50-100 | House |\n| Šabac | $350 | $40-90 | House |\n| Kraljevo | $300 | $30-80 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Serbia, but they must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Justice, which can take several months to process.\n- Foreign companies can also buy property, but they must be registered in Serbia and have a local director.\n- There are no restrictions on the type of property that can be bought, but foreigners are not allowed to buy agricultural land.\n- Foreigners can lease property for up to 99 years, which can be a viable alternative to buying.\n- Foreigners must also register with the tax authorities and obtain a tax identification number in order to buy or sell property.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
