The country is further divided into two autonomous provinces: Vojvodina in the north and Kosovo and Metohija in the south, although the latter declared independence in 2008 and is not under Serbian control. The administrative structure of Serbia is based on a system of decentralization, with municipalities and districts having a significant degree of autonomy in managing local affairs.\n\nThe division of Serbia into districts and municipalities is primarily based on geographical and historical factors. The districts are responsible for coordinating the activities of municipalities and providing support in areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. The municipalities, on the other hand, are responsible for providing local services such as waste management, public transportation, and social services. This system of decentralization allows for more effective governance and decision-making at the local level.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Belgrade** (1.2M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its vibrant nightlife, historic fortress, and confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers\nBest For: history buffs, partygoers, and those interested in exploring the city's many museums and cultural attractions\n\n**Novi Sad** (250,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its well-preserved 18th-century architecture, vibrant arts scene, and annual Exit music festival\nBest For: music lovers, foodies, and those interested in exploring the city's many parks and gardens\n\n**Nis** (180,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, including the ancient Roman fortress of Mediana and the Ottoman-era fortress of Nis\nBest For: history enthusiasts, shoppers, and those interested in exploring the city's many cafes and restaurants\n\n**Kragujevac** (150,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant arts scene, and nearby medieval monastery of Ovcar-Kablar Gorge\nBest For: families, outdoor enthusiasts, and those interested in exploring the city's many parks and gardens\n\n**Subotica** (100,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its unique blend of Hungarian and Serbian cultures, historic architecture, and vibrant arts scene\nBest For: foodies, shoppers, and those interested in exploring the city's many museums and cultural attractions\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vojvodina | Flat, fertile plain | Agricultural production, multicultural heritage | Novi Sad |\n| Sumadija | Mountainous, forested | Historic monasteries, traditional villages | Kragujevac |\n| Pomoravlje | Valley, fertile plain | Agricultural production, historic towns | Jagodina |\n| Raska | Mountainous, forested | Historic monasteries, traditional villages | Kraljevo |\n| Rasina | Valley, fertile plain | Agricultural production, historic towns | Krusevac |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The northern region of Vojvodina is known for its flat, fertile plains and multicultural heritage, with a mix of Hungarian, Serbian, and other ethnic groups.\n- The central region of Sumadija is characterized by its mountainous terrain, historic monasteries, and traditional villages, with a strong emphasis on agriculture and forestry.\n- The eastern region of Pomoravlje is a valley with a fertile plain, known for its agricultural production and historic towns, with a mix of Serbian and other ethnic groups.\n- The southern region of Raska is mountainous and forested, with a strong emphasis on historic monasteries and traditional villages, with a predominantly Serbian population.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nSerbia has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, and buses connecting major cities and towns.
