  "content": "The population of Serbia is comprised of approximately 6.6 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a unique cultural landscape in the heart of Europe.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 6.6 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: -0.4%\nMedian Age: 42.8 years\nUrban Population: 56.4%\nPopulation Density: 85 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 75.5 years\nFertility Rate: 1.5 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nThe population of Serbia has been steadily declining over the past few decades, with a negative growth rate of approximately -0.4% per annum. This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including low fertility rates, aging population, and migration to other countries. The urban population accounts for around 56.4% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city of Belgrade. The population density of Serbia is relatively low, with an average of 85 people per square kilometer.\n\nThe decline in population has significant implications for the country's economy and social security system. The aging population, in particular, poses a challenge for the pension system and healthcare services. On the other hand, the urbanization trend presents opportunities for economic growth and development, particularly in the service sector. However, it also puts a strain on the infrastructure and resources of urban areas.\n\nSerbia's migration patterns are complex, with a significant number of people emigrating to other European countries in search of better economic opportunities. This brain drain has resulted in a loss of skilled and educated workforce, which can have long-term consequences for the country's economic development. On the other hand, Serbia has also received a significant number of refugees and migrants from neighboring countries, which has put a strain on the country's resources and social services.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Serbs | 83.3% | Throughout the country | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Hungarians | 3.5% | Vojvodina | Significant minority in the north |\n| Roma | 2.1% | Throughout the country | Minority group with significant social and economic challenges |\n| Bosniaks | 2.0% | Sandžak region | Muslim minority group |\n| Croats | 0.9% | Vojvodina | Minority group in the north |\n| Montenegrins | 0.9% | Throughout the country | Minority group with close cultural ties to Serbs |\n| Albanians | 0.5% | Southwestern regions | Minority group with significant cultural and linguistic differences |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic landscape of Serbia is characterized by a dominant Serbian population, with significant minority groups, including Hungarians, Roma, Bosniaks, and Croats. The relationships between these groups are complex and have been influenced by historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors. While there are tensions and challenges, Serbia has made significant progress in promoting ethnic diversity and inclusivity, particularly in the areas of education and cultural exchange.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Serbian** is the official language, spoken by the majority of the population\n- Hungarian is a recognized minority language, spoken in the northern region of Vojvodina\n- Romanian and Croatian are also spoken by minority groups in the north and west\n- English is becoming increasingly popular as a second language, particularly among the younger population\n- Turkish is spoken by some minority groups, particularly in the Sandžak region\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Orthodox Christianity | 84.6% | Dominant religion, closely tied to Serbian identity |\n| Catholicism | 5.0% | Significant minority, particularly in the north |\n| Islam | 3.1% | Minority religion, primarily practiced by Bosniaks and Albanians |\n| Protestantism | 1.0% | Small but significant minority, particularly in the north |\n| Atheism | 1.1% | Growing trend, particularly among the younger population |\n[/TABLE]\nSerbia is a multi-religious country, with Orthodox Christianity being the dominant faith. The relationships between different religious groups are generally good, with a strong tradition of interfaith dialogue and cooperation. However, there are also challenges, particularly in the areas of religious education and freedom of worship. The Serbian government has made significant efforts to promote religious tolerance and inclusivity, particularly in the aftermath of the Yugoslav conflicts.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 14.1% | Significant youth population, with implications for education and social services |\n| 15-24 | 11.4% | Young adult population, with high potential for economic contribution and migration |\n| 25-54 | 42.2% | Working-age population, with significant implications for the labor market and economy |\n| 55-64 | 16.3% | Aging population, with implications for pension and healthcare systems |\n| 65+ | 16.0% | Elderly population, with significant implications for social services and healthcare |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- The urban population accounts for around 56.4% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city of Belgrade\n- Novi Sad, Niš, and Kragujevac are other significant urban centers, with growing economies and populations\n- The fastest-growing cities are primarily located in the northern region of Vojvodina, driven by economic investment and migration\n- The diaspora community plays a significant role in Serbia's economy, with many expatriates contributing to the country's development through remittances and investments\n- Urbanization trends present opportunities for economic growth and development, particularly in the service sector, but also pose challenges for infrastructure and resource management.",
