[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Serbian healthcare system is based on a mixed model, combining elements of both public and private healthcare. The public system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and social health insurance, which covers the majority of the population. Private healthcare options are also available, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality services, often at a higher cost. The quality of care in Serbia is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical equipment. However, there are some challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to healthcare services can be limited.

In urban areas, such as **Belgrade**, the capital city, there are many high-quality hospitals and clinics, including some that specialize in specific areas of medicine, such as **cardiology** or **oncology**. These facilities often have modern equipment and well-trained staff, and offer a wide range of medical services. In contrast, rural areas often have more limited access to healthcare services, with fewer hospitals and clinics, and less specialized care available.

Despite these challenges, the Serbian healthcare system is generally well-organized, with a strong network of primary care providers, including general practitioners and specialists. Patients can usually access medical care quickly, and the cost of services is generally lower than in many other European countries.
