[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Serbia's infrastructure development level is generally considered to be moderate, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas. The country has made notable progress in recent years, with investments in transportation infrastructure, energy, and telecommunications. However, much work remains to be done to bring the country's infrastructure up to European standards. The urban-rural gap is a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity, clean water, and high-speed internet. The government has launched several initiatives aimed at addressing these disparities and promoting economic development in rural areas.

Despite these challenges, Serbia has made significant progress in recent years, with major investments in transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new highways and the modernization of the country's rail network. The energy sector has also seen significant investments, with a focus on increasing the use of renewable energy sources and improving the reliability of the power grid. The telecommunications sector has also experienced rapid growth, with the rollout of 4G and 5G networks and significant investments in fiber-optic infrastructure.

Serbia's infrastructure development is also influenced by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, making it an important transit country for goods and people. The country's infrastructure is being developed with the aim of increasing regional connectivity and promoting economic growth. The government has set ambitious targets for infrastructure development, including the construction of new highways, the modernization of the rail network, and the development of the country's energy and telecommunications sectors.
