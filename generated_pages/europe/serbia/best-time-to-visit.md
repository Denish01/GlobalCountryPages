[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Serbia is a landlocked country located in Southeastern Europe, with a temperate climate and four distinct seasons. The country can be divided into several climate zones, including the Pannonian Plain in the north, the Dinaric Alps in the west, and the Carpathian Mountains in the east. The climate varies greatly depending on the region, with the north being generally colder and more humid than the south. The dry season in Serbia typically runs from May to October, while the wet season takes place from November to April. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Serbia, with the spring and autumn being the best times to visit due to the mild weather and fewer crowds.

The summer months are peak tourist season in Serbia, with warm weather and long days making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking and swimming. However, the heat can be oppressive, especially in the cities, and the crowds can be overwhelming. The winter months, on the other hand, are much colder, with significant snowfall in the mountains, making it a great time for skiing and other winter sports. However, some tourist attractions and businesses may be closed during this time, and the roads can be treacherous.

The spring and autumn seasons are the best times to visit Serbia if you want to avoid the crowds and enjoy the mild weather. The temperatures are pleasant, ranging from 15°C to 25°C, making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities. The spring is also a great time to see the country's beautiful flora and fauna, with the blooming of flowers and trees, while the autumn is a great time to enjoy the harvest season and the vibrant colors of the changing leaves.
