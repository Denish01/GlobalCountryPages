Public education is generally considered to be of good quality, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. The language of instruction is Serbian, but some schools may offer additional languages such as English, French, or German. Compulsory education in Serbia lasts for 12 years, starting from the age of 7 and ending at the age of 18. International schools are available in larger cities such as Belgrade, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and the British A-level.\n\nThe quality of private education in Serbia can vary depending on the institution, but many private schools offer a high level of education with smaller class sizes and more individualized attention. Some private schools may also offer additional amenities such as sports facilities, libraries, and computer labs. International schools in Serbia often have a more diverse student body and teaching staff, and may offer a range of extracurricular activities and programs. However, the cost of private and international education in Serbia can be prohibitively expensive for many families, with tuition fees ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, but may lack resources and facilities |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range of quality and amenities, from basic to premium |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Similar to public primary, with a strong emphasis on core subjects |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | More advanced facilities and resources, with a focus on university preparation |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | High-quality education with a range of curricula and extracurricular activities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $0-$500 | $1,000-$3,000 | Low tuition fees for local students, with a range of programs and specializations |\n| Private University | $1,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$10,000 | Higher tuition fees, with a focus on business, law, and other professional programs |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$10,000 | $5,000-$20,000 | University of Belgrade, with a range of programs and research opportunities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$500 | Range of quality and amenities, from basic to premium |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | One-on-one instruction, with a focus on specific subjects or skills |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Group or individual instruction, with a range of languages and levels |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$200 | Basic supplies such as textbooks, notebooks, and pens |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Mandatory for many schools, with a range of prices and quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The University of Belgrade is considered one of the top universities in the region, with a range of programs and research opportunities.\n- International schools in Serbia often have a high level of education quality, with a range of curricula and extracurricular activities.\n- Private tutoring is a popular option for students who need additional support or want to improve their grades.\n- Scholarship opportunities are available for local and international students, with a range of programs and funding options.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular in Serbia, with a range of courses and programs available.\n- Expats and international students may want to consider enrolling in a private or international school, which can offer a more familiar curriculum and teaching style.",
