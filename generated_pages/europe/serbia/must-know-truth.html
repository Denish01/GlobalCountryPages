        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Serbia has a rich and complex history, with various empires and dynasties vying for control over the region. The <strong>Serbian Kingdom</strong> was established in the 13th century, and it reached its peak during the reign of <strong>Stefan Nemanja</strong>. The kingdom was later absorbed into the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong>, which ruled Serbia from the 14th to the 19th century. Serbia gained autonomy from the Ottoman Empire in 1835 and became a principality, with <strong>Miloš Obrenović</strong> as its first ruler. The country declared independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, following the <strong>Congress of Berlin</strong>.</p>
        <p>The 20th century saw Serbia become part of various state formations, including the <strong>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</strong>, which was formed in 1918 and included present-day Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Kosovo. During <strong>World War II</strong>, Yugoslavia was invaded by the <strong>Axis powers</strong>, and Serbia was occupied by Germany and its allies. After the war, Yugoslavia became a socialist state under the leadership of <strong>Josip Broz Tito</strong>, with Serbia as one of its six republics. The country began to break apart in the 1990s, with Serbia declaring independence in 2006, following the dissolution of <strong>Serbia and Montenegro</strong>.</p>
