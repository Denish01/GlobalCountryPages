[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Serbia operates on the principle of separation of powers, where the legislative, executive, and judicial branches are separate and independent. The **parliamentary system** allows for the National Assembly to elect the prime minister, who is then responsible for appointing ministers to the government. The president, while serving as head of state, has limited powers compared to the prime minister and plays a largely ceremonial role. Serbia is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and no federal divisions, although there are two autonomous provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo, with varying degrees of autonomy.

The **constitution** of Serbia, adopted in 2006, outlines the framework of government and the relationship between the branches. It also guarantees certain **fundamental rights** and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. The government is responsible for ensuring the **rule of law** and protecting the rights of citizens.

The political system in Serbia has been shaped by the country's history, including its experience under communist rule and the subsequent transition to democracy. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with a focus on **European integration** and **economic development**. However, challenges remain, including **corruption** and **organized crime**, which can undermine the stability of the government and the economy.
