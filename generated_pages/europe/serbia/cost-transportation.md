[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Serbia has a well-developed public transportation system, with buses, trams, and trolleys connecting major cities and towns. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent and reliable services. Most people in Serbia get around using public transportation, with buses being the most popular mode of transport. The country's capital, Belgrade, has a comprehensive public transportation network, including a bus and tram system, as well as a commuter train connecting the city to surrounding suburbs.

In addition to public transportation, many Serbians own cars, and driving is a common mode of transport, especially in rural areas where public transportation may be limited. However, traffic in major cities like Belgrade can be congested, and parking can be challenging. Ride-hailing services, such as Car:Go and TaxiX, are also available in major cities, providing an alternative to traditional taxis.
