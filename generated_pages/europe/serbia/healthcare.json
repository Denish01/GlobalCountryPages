The public system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and social health insurance, which covers the majority of the population. Private healthcare options are also available, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality services, often at a higher cost. The quality of care in Serbia is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical equipment. However, there are some challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to healthcare services can be limited.\n\nIn urban areas, such as **Belgrade**, the capital city, there are many high-quality hospitals and clinics, including some that specialize in specific areas of medicine, such as **cardiology** or **oncology**. These facilities often have modern equipment and well-trained staff, and offer a wide range of medical services. In contrast, rural areas often have more limited access to healthcare services, with fewer hospitals and clinics, and less specialized care available.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Serbian healthcare system is generally well-organized, with a strong network of primary care providers, including general practitioners and specialists. Patients can usually access medical care quickly, and the cost of services is generally lower than in many other European countries.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clinical Center of Serbia | Belgrade | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Belgrade Military Medical Academy | Belgrade | Public | General medicine, surgery, trauma | Limited |\n| St. Sava Clinical Center | Belgrade | Private | Cardiology, oncology, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Medika General Hospital | Belgrade | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Kragujevac Clinical Center | Kragujevac | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Niš Clinical Center | Niš | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Compulsory health insurance** is required for all citizens and residents, and covers a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions.\n- **Voluntary health insurance** is also available, and can provide additional coverage for services not included in the compulsory insurance, such as **dental care** or **vision care**.\n- **Private health insurance** is another option, and can provide more comprehensive coverage, often with higher premiums.\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for visitors to Serbia, and can provide coverage for unexpected medical expenses.\n- **Expats** can often purchase private health insurance, which can provide more comprehensive coverage than the compulsory insurance.\n- **Costs** vary depending on the type of insurance and the level of coverage, but are generally lower than in many other European countries.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Serbia, with many pharmacies located throughout the country.\n- **Prescriptions** are usually required for most medications, and can be obtained from a doctor or other medical professional.\n- **Common brands** of medications are often available, including **European** and **American** brands.\n- **Costs** are generally lower than in many other European countries, with many medications available at a lower cost.\n- **Availability** of medications can vary, particularly in rural areas, where some medications may not be readily available.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Routine vaccinations**, such as **measles** and **tetanus**, are recommended for all travelers to Serbia.\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are also recommended, particularly for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be spending time outdoors, or who will be working with animals.\n- **Tick-borne encephalitis** is a risk in some areas of Serbia, particularly in rural areas, and vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be spending time outdoors.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Serbia, with tap water safe to drink in most areas.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, with most restaurants and hotels following proper food handling and preparation procedures.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Serbia** is becoming increasingly popular as a destination for **medical tourism**, with many high-quality hospitals and clinics offering a wide range of medical services.\n- **Popular procedures** include **dental care**, **cosmetic surgery**, and **orthopedic surgery**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the **Clinical Center of Serbia** and the **Belgrade Military Medical Academy**.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many medical procedures available at a lower cost than in other European countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, call **112**, the national emergency number, for assistance.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with ambulances available in most areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or by using a mapping app, such as **Google Maps**.\n- **Insurance claims** can usually be filed with the insurance company, and may require documentation from the hospital or clinic.\n- **Language** can be a barrier in some areas, particularly in rural areas, where English may not be widely spoken.",
