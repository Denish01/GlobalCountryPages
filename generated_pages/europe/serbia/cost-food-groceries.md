[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, Serbia offers a mix of supermarkets and local markets, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and often have longer opening hours. However, prices can be higher compared to local markets, where fresh produce and meat can be found at lower prices. Local markets, also known as **green markets**, are a great place to buy fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as dairy products and baked goods. The prices at local markets can vary depending on the season and the quality of the products, but overall, they offer great value for money.

In general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods, household essentials, and imported products. Bargaining is not common in Serbia, but it's always a good idea to ask the vendor about the quality and origin of the products. Additionally, many local markets offer a **discount** for bulk purchases, so it's worth asking about this if you're planning to buy in large quantities.
