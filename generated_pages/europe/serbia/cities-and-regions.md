[SECTION] How Serbia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Serbia is divided into 138 municipalities and 24 districts, with the capital city of Belgrade being a separate administrative unit. The country is further divided into two autonomous provinces: Vojvodina in the north and Kosovo and Metohija in the south, although the latter declared independence in 2008 and is not under Serbian control. The administrative structure of Serbia is based on a system of decentralization, with municipalities and districts having a significant degree of autonomy in managing local affairs.

The division of Serbia into districts and municipalities is primarily based on geographical and historical factors. The districts are responsible for coordinating the activities of municipalities and providing support in areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. The municipalities, on the other hand, are responsible for providing local services such as waste management, public transportation, and social services. This system of decentralization allows for more effective governance and decision-making at the local level.
