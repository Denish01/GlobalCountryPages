[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Serbia has been steadily declining over the past few decades, with a negative growth rate of approximately -0.4% per annum. This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including low fertility rates, aging population, and migration to other countries. The urban population accounts for around 56.4% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city of Belgrade. The population density of Serbia is relatively low, with an average of 85 people per square kilometer.

The decline in population has significant implications for the country's economy and social security system. The aging population, in particular, poses a challenge for the pension system and healthcare services. On the other hand, the urbanization trend presents opportunities for economic growth and development, particularly in the service sector. However, it also puts a strain on the infrastructure and resources of urban areas.

Serbia's migration patterns are complex, with a significant number of people emigrating to other European countries in search of better economic opportunities. This brain drain has resulted in a loss of skilled and educated workforce, which can have long-term consequences for the country's economic development. On the other hand, Serbia has also received a significant number of refugees and migrants from neighboring countries, which has put a strain on the country's resources and social services.
