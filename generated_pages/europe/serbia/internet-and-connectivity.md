[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Serbia is generally of good quality, with average download speeds of 24 Mbps, which is relatively fast compared to some other European countries. However, there is a notable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in cities like Belgrade, Novi Sad, and Niš, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite these inconsistencies, the overall reliability of the internet in Serbia is relatively high, with most users experiencing few issues with their connections.

In terms of internet infrastructure, Serbia has made significant investments in recent years, with a focus on expanding fiber-optic networks and improving mobile coverage. As a result, most of the country is now covered by 4G networks, and limited 5G services are available in some areas. However, the quality of the internet can still vary depending on the location and the service provider, so it's a good idea to research the best options for your specific needs.

To buy a SIM card, you'll typically need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, although some providers may have additional requirements.
