        <h2>Visa Policy Overview</h2>
        <p>Serbia has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa. Citizens of over 90 countries can enter Serbia without a visa, including all European Union countries, the United States, Canada, and Australia. The visa policy is designed to promote tourism and economic cooperation with other countries, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. Serbia is a member of the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations, and its visa policy is aligned with international standards and best practices.</p>
        <p>The visa-free stay period varies depending on the country of citizenship, but it is typically 90 days within a 180-day period. Citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free entry can apply for a visa at a Serbian embassy or consulate in their home country. The application process typically involves submitting a completed application form, paying the required fee, and providing supporting documents such as a valid passport, proof of travel arrangements, and proof of sufficient funds. Serbia also offers an e-visa system for citizens of certain countries, which allows them to apply for a visa online and receive an electronic visa approval.</p>
        <h2>Requirements By Nationality</h2>
        <div class="table-wrapper"><table>

        <h2>By Visitor Type</h2>
        <p><strong>Tourists:</strong> Tourists can stay in Serbia for up to 90 days within a 180-day period without a visa, provided they have a valid passport and proof of onward travel. Extensions are possible, but must be applied for at a local police station. Tourists are also required to register with the local authorities within 24 hours of arrival.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Travelers:</strong> Business travelers may require a visa, depending on the purpose and duration of their stay. They will need to provide an invitation letter from a Serbian company, as well as proof of their business activities. The application process typically involves submitting a completed application form, paying the required fee, and providing supporting documents such as a valid passport, proof of travel arrangements, and proof of sufficient funds.</p>
        <p><strong>Students:</strong> Students who wish to study in Serbia will need to apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment at a Serbian university, as well as proof of sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay. The student visa is typically valid for one year, and can be renewed annually.</p>
        <p><strong>Workers:</strong> Workers who wish to work in Serbia will need to apply for a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a Serbian employer. The application process typically involves submitting a completed application form, paying the required fee, and providing supporting documents such as a valid passport, proof of travel arrangements, and proof of sufficient funds.</p>
        <h2>Documents Checklist</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Valid passport with at least six months' validity</li>
        <li>Completed visa application form (if required)</li>
        <li>Proof of onward travel</li>
        <li>Proof of sufficient funds</li>
        <li>Health insurance certificate</li>
        <li>Invitation letter (for business travelers)</li>
        <li>Proof of enrollment (for students)</li>
        <li>Sponsorship letter (for workers)</li>
        <li>Police certificate (for certain nationalities)</li>
        <li>Proof of accommodation</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Entry Points & Procedures</h2>
        <p>The main entry points to Serbia are Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade, as well as several land borders with neighboring countries. When arriving at the airport, visitors will need to proceed to the immigration counter, where they will need to present their passport and complete a customs declaration form. The immigration officer will then stamp their passport and provide a receipt, which must be kept until departure. Visitors who arrive by land will need to stop at a border crossing point, where they will need to present their passport and complete a customs declaration form.</p>
        <p>At the border crossing point, visitors will also need to provide proof of onward travel, as well as proof of sufficient funds. The border crossing process typically takes around 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the time of day and the number of visitors. Visitors who are required to register with the local authorities will need to do so within 24 hours of arrival. This can be done at a local police station, and requires the presentation of a valid passport and proof of accommodation.</p>
        <h2>Common Mistakes To Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Not having a valid passport with at least six months' validity</li>
        <li>Not having proof of onward travel</li>
        <li>Not having sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay</li>
        <li>Not registering with the local authorities within 24 hours of arrival</li>
        <li>Not having the required documents, such as a health insurance certificate or police certificate</li>
        <li>Not checking the visa requirements for your nationality before traveling to Serbia</li>
        </ul>
