[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Serbian cuisine is a reflection of the country's geographic location, with Mediterranean, Balkan, and Central European influences. The country's history, with periods of Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian rule, has also had a significant impact on its culinary traditions. As a result, Serbian cuisine is characterized by a mix of spices, herbs, and ingredients, with a focus on meat, bread, and dairy products. Regional variations are also notable, with different parts of the country having their own unique specialties and cooking styles.

The use of **paprika**, **garlic**, and **black pepper** is common in many Serbian dishes, and the country is also famous for its **rakia**, a type of fruit brandy. Serbian cuisine is often associated with hearty, comforting dishes, such as stews, soups, and roasted meats. The country's **peasant cuisine** has also had a significant impact on its culinary traditions, with many dishes made with locally sourced ingredients and traditional cooking methods.

In recent years, Serbian cuisine has experienced a resurgence in popularity, with many restaurants and chefs working to promote and preserve the country's culinary heritage.
