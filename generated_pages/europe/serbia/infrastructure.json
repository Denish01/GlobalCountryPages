  "content": "Serbia's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made in recent years to improve the country's transportation networks, energy sector, and telecommunications.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99.5% of population\nInternet Penetration: 73%\nRoad Network: 45,419 km, with 28% of roads in poor condition\nRail Network: 3,764 km\nMajor Airports: 2 international, 7 domestic\nMajor Ports: 1 major, on the Danube River\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSerbia's infrastructure development level is generally considered to be moderate, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas. The country has made notable progress in recent years, with investments in transportation infrastructure, energy, and telecommunications. However, much work remains to be done to bring the country's infrastructure up to European standards. The urban-rural gap is a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity, clean water, and high-speed internet. The government has launched several initiatives aimed at addressing these disparities and promoting economic development in rural areas.\n\nDespite these challenges, Serbia has made significant progress in recent years, with major investments in transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new highways and the modernization of the country's rail network. The energy sector has also seen significant investments, with a focus on increasing the use of renewable energy sources and improving the reliability of the power grid. The telecommunications sector has also experienced rapid growth, with the rollout of 4G and 5G networks and significant investments in fiber-optic infrastructure.\n\nSerbia's infrastructure development is also influenced by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, making it an important transit country for goods and people. The country's infrastructure is being developed with the aim of increasing regional connectivity and promoting economic growth. The government has set ambitious targets for infrastructure development, including the construction of new highways, the modernization of the rail network, and the development of the country's energy and telecommunications sectors.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 45,419 km | Moderate | 28% of roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 3,764 km | Good | Electrified rail network, with modern trains |\n| Airports | 2 international, 7 domestic | Good | Modern airport facilities, with expanding route networks |\n| Ports | 1 major, on the Danube River | Moderate | Limited capacity, with plans for expansion |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Power generation** is primarily based on coal and natural gas, with a growing focus on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.\n- The **reliability of the power grid** has improved in recent years, with significant investments in modernizing the grid and reducing power outages.\n- **Renewable energy** is becoming an increasingly important part of Serbia's energy mix, with the government setting ambitious targets for the development of wind and solar power.\n- **Energy efficiency** is also a key focus area, with efforts to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of energy-efficient technologies.\n- **Electricity access** is available to 99.5% of the population, with efforts to extend access to the remaining 0.5% of the population.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is generally good, with 95% of the population having access to safe drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also good, with 90% of the population having access to modern sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access in rural areas** is a challenge, with many rural communities lacking access to reliable and safe drinking water.\n- **Water quality** is also a concern, with many rivers and lakes polluted due to industrial and agricultural activities.\n- **Wastewater treatment** is a key focus area, with efforts to improve the treatment of wastewater and reduce pollution.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with 98% of the population having access to mobile networks.\n- **Fiber-optic infrastructure** is being rolled out, with significant investments in expanding the country's fiber-optic network.\n- **4G and 5G rollout** is underway, with several operators offering high-speed mobile services.\n- **Internet penetration** is 73%, with a growing number of people accessing the internet through mobile devices.\n- **Postal services** are also available, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Corridor 10 highway project** is a major infrastructure development project, aimed at improving road connectivity between Belgrade and the border with Bulgaria.\n- The **Belgrade-Niš highway project** is another major infrastructure development project, aimed at improving road connectivity between Belgrade and the southern city of Niš.\n- The **Serbia-Bulgaria gas pipeline project** is a key energy infrastructure project, aimed at increasing the country's energy security and promoting regional cooperation.\n- The **Kostolac power plant project** is a major energy infrastructure project, aimed at increasing the country's power generation capacity and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.\n- The **Belgrade water supply project** is a key water infrastructure project, aimed at improving the city's water supply and reducing water losses.",
