[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nSerbia has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa. Citizens of over 90 countries can enter Serbia without a visa, including all European Union countries, the United States, Canada, and Australia. The visa policy is designed to promote tourism and economic cooperation with other countries, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. Serbia is a member of the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations, and its visa policy is aligned with international standards and best practices.\n\nThe visa-free stay period varies depending on the country of citizenship, but it is typically 90 days within a 180-day period. Citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free entry can apply for a visa at a Serbian embassy or consulate in their home country. The application process typically involves submitting a completed application form, paying the required fee, and providing supporting documents such as a valid passport, proof of travel arrangements, and proof of sufficient funds.
