[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Netherlands has a highly competitive rental market, particularly in cities like Amsterdam, where demand often exceeds supply. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 24 months, with a standard deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights in the Netherlands are well-protected by law, with strict regulations governing rent increases, lease terminations, and landlord-tenant disputes. Compared to regional neighbors like Belgium and Germany, the Netherlands has relatively high housing costs, driven by its strong economy, high standard of living, and limited housing supply.

The rental market in the Netherlands is characterized by a mix of modern apartments, historic canal houses, and suburban family homes. Many expats and students prefer to rent apartments in city centers, while families often opt for suburban homes with more space and a quieter environment. The government has implemented various measures to control rent increases and promote affordable housing, but the market remains highly competitive. As a result, renters should be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property, and be aware of their rights and obligations under Dutch tenancy law.
