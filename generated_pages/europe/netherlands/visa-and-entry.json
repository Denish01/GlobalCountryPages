[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Netherlands has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter the country without a visa. The country is part of the Schengen Area, which permits visa-free travel for up to 90 days within a 180-day period for citizens of 62 countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The Netherlands also has a visa waiver program for certain nationalities, making it relatively easy for tourists and business travelers to visit the country.\n\nThe Netherlands' visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate travel and trade. The country has a points-based system for assessing visa applications, which takes into account factors such as the applicant's purpose of travel, their financial resources, and their ties to their home country. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa waiver agreement with the Netherlands will need to apply for a visa at a Dutch embassy or consulate before traveling to the country.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | Unlimited | Must have a valid passport or ID card |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at a Dutch embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at a Dutch embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can stay in the Netherlands for up to 90 days without a visa, as long as they have a valid passport and proof of onward travel.
