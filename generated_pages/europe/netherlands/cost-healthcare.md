[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The Netherlands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering high-quality medical care. The system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. For locals, the system is largely based on a mandatory health insurance system, where everyone is required to have a basic insurance package that covers essential medical care. This package includes doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is highly recommended that they have some form of health insurance to cover any medical expenses.

The quality of public and private healthcare in the Netherlands is generally high, with both options offering good medical care. However, private healthcare is often considered to be of higher quality, with shorter waiting times and more personalized care. Public healthcare, on the other hand, is generally less expensive, but may have longer waiting times. It is worth noting that the Netherlands has a system of **healthcare allowances**, which are government-funded subsidies that help low-income individuals pay for their healthcare costs.
