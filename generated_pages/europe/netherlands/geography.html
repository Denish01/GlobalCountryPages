        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>The Netherlands is located in Northwestern Europe, bordering the North Sea to the north and west. It shares its borders with two countries: Belgium to the south and Germany to the east. The country is situated at the delta of the Rhine, Maas, and Waal rivers, which flow into the North Sea. The Netherlands is a relatively small country, with a total area of approximately 41,543 square kilometers. Its strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and commerce in Europe.</p>
        <p>The Netherlands is also bordered by the Wadden Sea to the north, which is a shallow sea that separates the mainland from the West Frisian Islands. The country's coastline is approximately 451 kilometers long, with a mix of sandy beaches, dunes, and coastal wetlands. The Netherlands is a member of the European Union and is connected to the rest of Europe through a network of roads, railways, and waterways. Its location at the heart of Europe makes it an attractive destination for tourists and business travelers alike.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>The Netherlands is a low-lying country, with much of its terrain below sea level. The country's landscape is characterized by flat plains, coastal dunes, and river deltas. The highest point in the Netherlands is the Vaalserberg, which is located in the southeastern part of the country and stands at an elevation of 322.7 meters. The lowest point is the Zuidplaspolder, which is a polder (a low-lying area of land reclaimed from water) located near the city of Rotterdam and has an elevation of -7 meters.</p>
        <p>The Netherlands is also home to a number of rivers, including the Rhine, Maas, and Waal, which flow through the country and empty into the North Sea. The country's coastline is protected by a series of dunes and dikes, which have been built to prevent flooding and erosion. The Netherlands is also famous for its <strong>polders</strong>, which are areas of land that have been reclaimed from the sea and are protected by dikes and canals. These polders are used for agriculture, housing, and other purposes.</p>
        <p>The country's landscape is also characterized by a number of <strong>canals</strong>, which are used for transportation, drainage, and irrigation. The Netherlands is often referred to as the "land of water," due to its extensive network of canals, rivers, and lakes. The country's unique landscape has been shaped by its history, geography, and climate, and is a major part of its identity and charm.</p>
