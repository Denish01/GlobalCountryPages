[SECTION] How Netherlands Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Netherlands is divided into 12 provinces, each with its own capital and governing body.

The provinces are: Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe, Overijssel, Flevoland, Gelderland, Utrecht, Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Zeeland, Noord-Brabant, and Limburg. This administrative structure allows for a balance of power between the central government and the regional authorities.
