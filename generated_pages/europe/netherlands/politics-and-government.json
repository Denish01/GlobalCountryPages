The **Constitution** of the Netherlands, adopted in 1815, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the monarch, the parliament, and the council of ministers. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **parliamentary system** gives significant power to the legislature, which is composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nThe Netherlands is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government that has authority over the entire country. However, the country is divided into **provinces** and **municipalities**, which have some degree of autonomy. The government has implemented a system of **decentralization**, giving more powers to the provinces and municipalities to manage their own affairs. This system allows for more local decision-making and flexibility in addressing regional issues.\n\nThe Netherlands has a **multi-party system**, with several parties represented in the parliament. This leads to coalition governments, where parties must work together to form a majority and pass legislation. The government is accountable to the parliament, which has the power to approve or reject laws and budgets. The **independent judiciary** plays a crucial role in ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the constitution and the law.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Prime Minister Mark Rutte | Head of government, responsible for policy-making and implementation |\n| Legislative | States General | President of the House of Representatives Vera Bergkamp | Makes laws, approves budgets, and exercises parliamentary control over the government |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court Dineke de Leyen | Interprets laws, ensures that the government acts in accordance with the constitution and the law |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) | Center-right | Mark Rutte | 34 | Liberal party, advocates for free market economy and individual freedom |\n| Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) | Center-right | Wopke Hoekstra | 19 | Christian democratic party, emphasizes social justice and Christian values |\n| Democrats 66 (D66) | Center-left | Sigrid Kaag | 24 | Liberal party, advocates for progressive policies and European integration |\n| Party for Freedom (PVV) | Right-wing | Geert Wilders | 17 | Populist party, advocates for anti-immigration and anti-EU policies |\n| Socialist Party (SP) | Left-wing | Lilian Marijnissen | 9 | Socialist party, emphasizes social justice and workers' rights |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The Netherlands has a **proportional representation** electoral system, where voters elect representatives to the parliament based on the number of votes received by each party.\n- Elections are held every four years, with the most recent election taking place in 2021.\n- The next election is scheduled to take place in 2025.\n- Voter participation is generally high, with around 80% of eligible voters casting their ballots in the 2021 election.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The Netherlands is considered a stable democracy, with a strong tradition of **consensus politics** and **coalition-building**.\n- However, the country faces challenges related to **immigration and integration**, with debates over asylum policies and the role of Islam in Dutch society.\n- The Netherlands is also addressing issues related to **climate change**, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable energy.\n- The country has a high level of **social cohesion**, with a strong emphasis on social welfare and public services.\n- The Netherlands is also dealing with the impact of **Brexit**, with trade and economic relations with the UK being an important aspect of its foreign policy.\n- The country is committed to **European integration**, with a strong role in the European Union and a supporter of further EU cooperation.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- The Netherlands is a member of the **European Union** and the **United Nations**, and plays an active role in international organizations.\n- The country has a strong **transatlantic relationship** with the United States, with cooperation on issues such as trade, security, and climate change.\n- The Netherlands is also a member of the **NATO** alliance, with a commitment to collective defense and security cooperation.\n- The country has a **diplomatic stance** that emphasizes multilateralism, human rights, and sustainable development, with a focus on promoting peace and stability in regions such as the Middle East and Africa.\n- The Netherlands is also an active participant in **international trade agreements**, with a strong emphasis on promoting free trade and economic cooperation.",
