  "content": "The cost of healthcare in the Netherlands can vary depending on the type of care and insurance, with the average health expenditure per capita being around $6,845 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $6,845\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 11.8%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Netherlands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering high-quality medical care. The system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. For locals, the system is largely based on a mandatory health insurance system, where everyone is required to have a basic insurance package that covers essential medical care. This package includes doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. For foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is highly recommended that they have some form of health insurance to cover any medical expenses.\n\nThe quality of public and private healthcare in the Netherlands is generally high, with both options offering good medical care. However, private healthcare is often considered to be of higher quality, with shorter waiting times and more personalized care. Public healthcare, on the other hand, is generally less expensive, but may have longer waiting times. It is worth noting that the Netherlands has a system of **healthcare allowances**, which are government-funded subsidies that help low-income individuals pay for their healthcare costs.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $25-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$60 | $60-$120 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$40 | $40-$80 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$40 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $100-$200 | Essential medical care, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | All medical care, including specialist consultations, dental care, and **alternative therapies** |\n| International / Expat | $300-$600 | Global medical coverage, including emergency evacuations and **repatriation** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally less expensive in the Netherlands than in other countries, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 per prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with prices ranging from $5 to $10 per item.\n- Pharmacists in the Netherlands are highly trained and can provide advice on **medication management** and **disease prevention**.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a doctor, while others can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- Pharmacy hours are generally long, with many pharmacies open from 8am to 6pm, Monday to Friday.\n- Medication prices can vary depending on the pharmacy and location, so it's a good idea to shop around for the best prices.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the emergency number 112, which is available 24/7.
