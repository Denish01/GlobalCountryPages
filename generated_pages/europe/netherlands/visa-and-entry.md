# Netherlands Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Netherlands before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The Netherlands has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter the country without a visa. The country is part of the Schengen Area, which permits visa-free travel for up to 90 days within a 180-day period for citizens of 62 countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The Netherlands also has a visa waiver program for certain nationalities, making it relatively easy for tourists and business travelers to visit the country.

The Netherlands' visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate travel and trade. The country has a points-based system for assessing visa applications, which takes into account factors such as the applicant's purpose of travel, their financial resources, and their ties to their home country. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa waiver agreement with the Netherlands will need to apply for a visa at a Dutch embassy or consulate before traveling to the country.
