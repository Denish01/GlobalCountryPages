[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Netherlands has a temperate maritime climate, with cool winters and mild summers. The country's climate is influenced by its location in Northwestern Europe, with the North Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The climate is generally mild, with average temperatures ranging from 2°C in winter to 22°C in summer. The Netherlands has a distinct wet and dry season, with most of the rainfall occurring between October and March. The spring and summer months are the best time to visit, with long days and mild weather, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as cycling and hiking.

The country's climate is also characterized by its wind, with the prevailing winds coming from the northwest. The winds can be strong, especially in the coastal areas, and can make the temperature feel cooler than it actually is. The Netherlands is also known for its fog, which can occur in the winter months, especially in the morning. The fog can be dense and can reduce visibility, making it difficult to navigate.

The seasons in the Netherlands have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season being the summer months. During this time, the country's tourist attractions are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are high. The spring and autumn months are also popular, with many tourists visiting the country to see the flowers and enjoy the mild weather.
