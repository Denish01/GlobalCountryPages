[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Netherlands' government is based on the principles of **separation of powers**, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches each having distinct roles. The **Constitution** of the Netherlands, adopted in 1815, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the monarch, the parliament, and the council of ministers. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **parliamentary system** gives significant power to the legislature, which is composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The Netherlands is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government that has authority over the entire country. However, the country is divided into **provinces** and **municipalities**, which have some degree of autonomy. The government has implemented a system of **decentralization**, giving more powers to the provinces and municipalities to manage their own affairs. This system allows for more local decision-making and flexibility in addressing regional issues.

The Netherlands has a **multi-party system**, with several parties represented in the parliament. This leads to coalition governments, where parties must work together to form a majority and pass legislation. The government is accountable to the parliament, which has the power to approve or reject laws and budgets. The **independent judiciary** plays a crucial role in ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the constitution and the law.
