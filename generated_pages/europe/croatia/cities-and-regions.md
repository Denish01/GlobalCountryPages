[SECTION] How Croatia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Croatia is divided into 20 counties, also known as županije, and the capital city of Zagreb, which has a special status. The counties are further divided into cities and municipalities, with a total of 128 cities and 428 municipalities. The administrative structure is based on a combination of historical, geographical, and economic factors. The counties have a significant degree of autonomy, with their own governments and responsibilities for areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

The division of Croatia into counties and municipalities has its roots in the country's history, with many of the counties corresponding to historical regions or provinces. The current administrative structure was established in 1992, after Croatia gained independence from Yugoslavia. Since then, there have been some changes to the boundaries and responsibilities of the counties, but the overall structure has remained the same.
