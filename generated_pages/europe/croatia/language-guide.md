Croatian is the primary language spoken in Croatia, with the majority of the population speaking it as their first language. The linguistic landscape of Croatia is diverse, with several regional dialects and minority languages spoken throughout the country. The most widely spoken dialects are Shtokavian, Chakavian, and Kajkavian, each with its own distinct pronunciation and vocabulary. Additionally, many Croatians speak English as a second language, particularly in tourist areas and among the younger population. English proficiency is generally high, making it easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the country.

Croatia has a significant number of minority languages, including Serbian, Hungarian, and Italian, which are spoken by smaller communities throughout the country. These languages are recognized and protected by the Croatian government, and many signs and official documents are translated into these languages. Despite the diversity of languages spoken in Croatia, Croatian is the dominant language and is used in all official contexts, including government, education, and media.

The widespread use of English in Croatia has made it a popular destination for tourists, with many restaurants, hotels, and attractions catering to English-speaking visitors.
