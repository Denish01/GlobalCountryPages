However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural regions often lacking access to high-quality infrastructure.

The country's strategic location in Southeastern Europe also makes it an important hub for trade and transportation in the region.\n\nCroatia's infrastructure development has been driven in part by its accession to the European Union in 2013, which has provided access to significant funding and investment opportunities. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including investments in renewable energy and telecommunications.
