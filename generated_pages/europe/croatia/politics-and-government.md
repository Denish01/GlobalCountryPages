[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Croatian government is based on the principle of **separation of powers**, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches each having distinct roles. The **Croatian Parliament (Sabor)** is the unicameral legislature, composed of 151 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **President** serves as the head of state, while the **Prime Minister** is the head of government, responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration. The **judicial system** is independent, with the **Constitutional Court** ensuring that laws are in line with the constitution.

The Croatian political system is characterized by a **multi-party system**, with several parties represented in the parliament. The government is formed by a coalition of parties, which must have the confidence of the parliament. The **opposition** plays a crucial role in holding the government accountable and providing alternative policies. The **electoral system** is based on proportional representation, which allows for a diverse representation of parties in the parliament.

Croatia's **unitary system** means that the central government has significant powers, with some decentralization to local authorities. The country is divided into **20 counties** and the **City of Zagreb**, which has a special status. The counties have some autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, but the central government retains significant control over key policy areas.
