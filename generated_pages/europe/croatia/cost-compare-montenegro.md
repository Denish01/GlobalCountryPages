[SECTION] Overview: Croatia vs Montenegro [/SECTION]
Croatia and Montenegro are two neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe, both offering a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. However, when it comes to cost of living, there are significant differences between the two countries. Croatia, with its stronger economy and higher standard of living, tends to be more expensive than Montenegro. The GDP per capita in Croatia is significantly higher than in Montenegro, which is reflected in the prices of goods and services. On the other hand, Montenegro, with its smaller economy and lower cost of living, offers a more affordable alternative for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Croatia has a more developed tourism industry, which drives up prices in popular destinations like Dubrovnik and Split. In contrast, Montenegro's tourism industry is still developing, which means that prices are generally lower. Additionally, the cost of living in Montenegro is also influenced by its proximity to Serbia and the use of the euro as a de facto currency. Overall, Montenegro is generally 10-20% cheaper than Croatia, making it an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable lifestyle.
