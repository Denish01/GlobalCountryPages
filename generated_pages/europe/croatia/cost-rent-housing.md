[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Croatia's rental market is relatively competitive, especially in the capital city of Zagreb and other tourist destinations like Split and Dubrovnik. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and landlords are required to provide a written contract outlining the terms of the agreement. Compared to regional neighbors like Slovenia and Hungary, Croatia's housing costs are relatively moderate, although prices have been increasing in recent years due to tourism and foreign investment.

The housing market in Croatia is also influenced by the country's **seasonal tourism industry**, which can drive up prices in coastal areas during the summer months. However, outside of the peak season, renters can often find more affordable options. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights, making it a more attractive option for expats and locals alike. With an **inflation rate** of 3.0% (2024) and a **health expenditure per capita** of $1,548 (2023), Croatia offers a relatively high standard of living, although out-of-pocket health expenses can be significant, making up 9.4% of total health expenditure (2023).
