[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Croatia has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, with the climate varying across different regions. The coastal regions have a Mediterranean climate with mild winters and warm summers, while the inland regions have a continental climate with colder winters and hotter summers. The country experiences a dry season from June to September, with most of the rainfall occurring during the winter months. The summer months are the peak tourist season, with warm weather and long days, making it ideal for beachgoers and island-hoppers. However, the crowds and prices can be overwhelming, especially in popular destinations like Dubrovnik and Split. The shoulder season, which includes the spring and autumn months, offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices, making it perfect for exploring the country's historic cities, national parks, and cultural events.

The weather in Croatia can be quite unpredictable, especially during the spring and autumn months. The **Bora** wind, a strong northeasterly wind, can bring cold and rainy weather, especially in the coastal regions. On the other hand, the **Sirocco** wind, a warm and humid wind, can bring hot and sunny weather, especially during the summer months. Understanding the local weather patterns can help you plan your trip and make the most of your time in Croatia.

The seasons in Croatia also affect the travel options and activities available. During the peak season, the ferry schedules are more frequent, and the tourist infrastructure is in full swing. However, during the off-season, some tourist facilities and attractions may be closed, and the ferry schedules may be reduced. The spring and autumn months are ideal for hiking, biking, and outdoor activities, while the summer months are perfect for swimming, snorkeling, and water sports.
