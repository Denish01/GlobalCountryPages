  "content": "Healthcare costs in Croatia can vary significantly depending on whether you are using the public or private healthcare system, with the average health expenditure per capita being $1,548.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,548\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 9.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: EUR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nCroatia's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining elements of both public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the system can be slow and bureaucratic, with long waiting times for non-emergency procedures. Locals are covered by the public healthcare system, which is funded through a combination of payroll taxes and government subsidies. Foreigners, on the other hand, may need to purchase private health insurance or pay out-of-pocket for medical services. While it is not mandatory for foreigners to have health insurance, it is highly recommended to avoid high medical bills.\n\nThe quality of private healthcare in Croatia is generally higher than that of the public system, with shorter waiting times and more modern facilities. However, private healthcare is also more expensive, and many medical services are not covered by the public healthcare system. Foreigners who plan to stay in Croatia for an extended period may want to consider purchasing private health insurance to ensure they have access to quality medical care. It's also worth noting that some medical services, such as dental care and prescription medications, may not be covered by the public healthcare system, and may need to be paid for out-of-pocket or through private insurance.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist consultations, advanced medical procedures, dental care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, emergency medical evacuations, maternity care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications can cost between $5-$20 per month, depending on the type and quantity of medication.\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as pain relievers and antihistamines, can cost between $5-$15 per package.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in Croatia, with many locations open 24 hours a day.\n- Some medications, such as antibiotics and strong painkillers, may require a prescription from a doctor.\n- Prices for medications can vary depending on the pharmacy and location, with larger cities tend to have higher prices.\n- It's recommended to always check the prices and availability of medications before purchasing, as they can vary significantly.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the emergency number, 112, which is available 24 hours a day. Ambulances are widely available, and emergency medical services are generally of good quality. For foreigners, it's recommended to visit one of the larger hospitals in the major cities, such as Zagreb or Split, which have better facilities and more English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners include the University Hospital Zagreb and the Split University Hospital, which offer a range of medical services, including emergency care, surgery, and specialist consultations. It's also a good idea to have a basic knowledge of Croatian, as not all medical staff may speak English. Additionally, it's recommended to have a list of important phone numbers, such as your embassy and insurance provider, in case of an emergency.",
