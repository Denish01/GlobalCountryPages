  "content": "Croatia's property market is open to foreigners, with various investment opportunities available, particularly in the coastal regions and major cities. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nCan Foreigners Buy?: Yes\nAverage Price (Capital, per sqm): $2,500 USD\nRental Yield: 4-6%\nProperty Tax: 1.1-1.5%\nPopular Areas: Dubrovnik, Split, Zagreb\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]\nCroatia's property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by tourism and foreign investment. The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a focus on renovation and redevelopment of historic properties. The coastal regions, particularly Dubrovnik, Split, and the islands, are highly sought after by tourists and investors alike, resulting in higher prices and rental yields. In contrast, the rural areas and inland regions offer more affordable options, but with lower demand and slower price growth. The urban areas, such as Zagreb, are also experiencing growth, driven by a strong economy and a growing expat community.\n\nThe current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from apartments and houses to commercial spaces and land. However, the market is expected to continue growing, driven by Croatia's accession to the EU and the increasing popularity of the country as a tourist destination. As a result, prices are likely to rise, making it essential for investors to act quickly to secure the best deals. The price trajectory is expected to be steady, with an annual growth rate of around 5-7%, driven by demand from foreign buyers and the limited supply of properties in prime locations.\n\nThe difference between urban and rural areas is significant, with urban areas offering a wider range of amenities, services, and job opportunities, but also higher prices and living costs. In contrast, rural areas offer a more relaxed pace of life, lower prices, and a stronger sense of community, but with limited access to amenities and services. As a result, investors need to carefully consider their priorities and goals when choosing between urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Zagreb | $2,500 | $400-600 | Apartment |\n| Dubrovnik | $4,000 | $800-1,200 | Apartment |\n| Split | $3,000 | $500-800 | Apartment |\n| Plitvice Lakes | $1,500 | $200-300 | House |\n| Istria | $2,000 | $300-500 | Apartment |\n| Hvar | $3,500 | $600-1,000 | House |\n| Rijeka | $1,800 | $250-400 | Apartment |\n| Sibenik | $2,200 | $300-500 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Croatia, but they need to obtain a **permit** from the Ministry of Justice, which can take several months to process.\n- EU citizens do not need a permit, but they still need to register with the local authorities.\n- Non-EU citizens can also buy property through a **company structure**, which can simplify the process and reduce the need for permits.\n- Foreigners can also lease property, with a typical lease term of 1-5 years, and a **security deposit** of 1-2 months' rent.\n- It is essential to work with a **reputable lawyer** to ensure that all paperwork and permits are in order.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
