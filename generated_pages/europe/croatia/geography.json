It shares borders with several countries, including Slovenia to the northwest, Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the southeast, and Montenegro to the south. The country also has a long coastline along the Adriatic Sea, which provides access to the Mediterranean Sea. Croatia's unique position at the crossroads of Europe makes it an important cultural and economic hub in the region.\n\nCroatia's borders are characterized by a mix of mountains, forests, and coastal areas. The country's geography has played a significant role in shaping its history and culture, with the Dinaric Alps running along the eastern coast and the Pannonian Plain covering much of the northeastern part of the country. The Adriatic Sea has also had a profound impact on Croatia's development, with many of its major cities, including Dubrovnik and Split, located along the coast. The country's borders have been shaped by its complex history, with various empires and kingdoms vying for control over the region throughout the centuries.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nCroatia's terrain is diverse and varied, with a range of different landscapes and ecosystems. The country can be divided into three main regions: the Pannonian Plain, the Dinaric Alps, and the Adriatic coast. The Pannonian Plain is a fertile region in the northeast, covering much of the area near the Hungarian border. This region is characterized by rolling hills, vast plains, and numerous rivers, including the Danube and the Sava. The Dinaric Alps, on the other hand, are a rugged and mountainous range that runs along the eastern coast, with peaks reaching elevations of over 1,800 meters.\n\nThe Adriatic coast is a narrow strip of land that runs along the western edge of the country, with a range of islands, bays, and inlets. This region is known for its stunning natural beauty, with crystal-clear waters, rocky shores, and picturesque villages. The coast is also home to many of Croatia's most popular tourist destinations, including Dubrovnik, Split, and Plitvice Lakes National Park. In addition to these main regions, Croatia is also home to a number of forests, including the Velebit Mountains, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe country's landscape has been shaped by a combination of tectonic activity, erosion, and human settlement. The Dinaric Alps, for example, were formed as a result of the collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, while the Pannonian Plain was created by the flooding of the Pannonian Sea during the Miocene epoch. Human settlement has also had a significant impact on the landscape, with many areas being cleared for agriculture, urbanization, and other human activities.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 10-20°C | moderate | mild, sunny |\n| Summer | June to August | 22-28°C | low | hot, dry |\n| Autumn | September to November | 10-20°C | moderate | mild, rainy |\n| Winter | December to February | 0-10°C | high | cold, snowy |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: June to September.
