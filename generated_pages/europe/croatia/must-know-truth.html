        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Croatia, a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in <strong>Europe</strong>, has a rich and complex history that spans over a thousand years. The area that is now Croatia was inhabited by various tribes, including the <strong>Illyrians</strong> and <strong>Celts</strong>, before being conquered by the <strong>Romans</strong> in the 1st century BC. The Roman Empire ruled Croatia for several centuries, leaving a lasting legacy in the country's architecture, language, and culture. In the 7th century AD, <strong>Slavic tribes</strong> arrived in the region, and Croatia became a medieval kingdom in the 10th century.</p>
        <p>In the 12th century, Croatia formed a union with <strong>Hungary</strong>, which lasted for nearly 900 years. During this period, Croatia was also influenced by the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong>, which controlled parts of the country from the 16th to the 19th century. In the 20th century, Croatia became part of <strong>Yugoslavia</strong>, a socialist federal republic that included several other countries in the region. Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, which led to a brutal <strong>civil war</strong> that lasted from 1991 to 1995.</p>
        <p>Croatia's history has been marked by various periods of foreign rule, including the <strong>Austro-Hungarian Empire</strong> and the <strong>Nazi</strong> and <strong>Fascist</strong> regimes during World War II. The country's complex history has had a significant impact on its culture, language, and national identity. Today, Croatia is a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> and a member of the <strong>European Union</strong> and <strong>NATO</strong>. The country has a population of approximately <strong>3.9 million people</strong>, with the majority being <strong>Croatian</strong>.</p>
        <p>Croatia's history has also been shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of <strong>Central Europe</strong>, <strong>Southeastern Europe</strong>, and the <strong>Mediterranean</strong>. The country's unique cultural and geographical position has made it an important center for trade, commerce, and tourism. From the <strong>Roman ruins</strong> in <strong>Split</strong> to the <strong>medieval walls</strong> in <strong>Dubrovnik</strong>, Croatia's rich history is evident in its many historical landmarks and cultural attractions.</p>
