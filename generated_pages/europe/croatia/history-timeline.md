# Croatia History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Croatia is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans over a thousand years, from the arrival of the **Croats** in the 7th century to the country's modern-day status as a **sovereign state**.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of Croatia began with the arrival of the Croats, a Slavic tribe, in the 7th century. The Croats settled in the region and established the **Duchy of Croatia**, which eventually became a kingdom in the 10th century. In the 12th century, Croatia formed a union with **Hungary**, which lasted for nearly 900 years. During this period, Croatia maintained a significant degree of autonomy, but it was also subject to Hungarian rule. In the 16th century, Croatia became a battleground in the conflict between the **Habsburg Empire** and the **Ottoman Empire**, with the Ottomans eventually conquering much of the country. The 19th century saw a surge in Croatian nationalism, with the country seeking greater autonomy and eventually independence from Hungary.

In the 20th century, Croatia became part of the **Kingdom of Yugoslavia**, which was formed after World War I. However, the country's experience in Yugoslavia was marked by tension and conflict, particularly during World War II, when Croatia was occupied by the **Axis powers**. After the war, Croatia became a **socialist republic** within the **Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia**, led by **Josip Broz Tito**. With Tito's death in 1980, Yugoslavia began to unravel, and Croatia declared its independence in 1991, leading to a brutal conflict with the **Yugoslav People's Army**. The country has since transitioned to a **democratic system** and has become a member of the **European Union** and **NATO**.

The medieval period in Croatia was marked by the construction of numerous **fortresses** and **castles**, which still dot the country's landscape today. The **Catholic Church** played a significant role in Croatian history, with the country maintaining a strong Catholic tradition to this day. The **Ottoman Empire's** conquest of Croatia had a profound impact on the country's culture, with many Croatian cities and towns still bearing the architectural and cultural marks of Ottoman rule.

In recent years, Croatia has experienced significant economic growth and has become a popular tourist destination, with visitors drawn to its stunning natural beauty, rich history, and vibrant culture. The country's **coastline** along the **Adriatic Sea** is particularly popular, with cities like **Dubrovnik** and **Split** attracting millions of visitors each year.
