Croatia's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with a focus on improving the country's transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications.

Despite this, Croatia's infrastructure is generally well-maintained and reliable, making it an attractive destination for tourists and businesses alike. The country's strategic location in Southeastern Europe also makes it an important hub for trade and transportation in the region.

Croatia's infrastructure development has been driven in part by its accession to the European Union in 2013, which has provided access to significant funding and investment opportunities. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including investments in renewable energy and telecommunications. As a result, Croatia's infrastructure is becoming increasingly modern and efficient, with a focus on sustainability and environmental protection.

This has included investments in hotel development, tourism facilities, and infrastructure such as roads, airports, and ports. As a result, Croatia has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, with over 13 million visitors per year.
