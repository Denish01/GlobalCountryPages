The counties are further divided into cities and municipalities, with a total of 128 cities and 428 municipalities. The administrative structure is based on a combination of historical, geographical, and economic factors. The counties have a significant degree of autonomy, with their own governments and responsibilities for areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\nThe division of Croatia into counties and municipalities has its roots in the country's history, with many of the counties corresponding to historical regions or provinces. The current administrative structure was established in 1992, after Croatia gained independence from Yugoslavia. Since then, there have been some changes to the boundaries and responsibilities of the counties, but the overall structure has remained the same.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Zagreb** (792,875)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic upper town, vibrant cultural scene, and bustling markets\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and urban exploration\n\n**Split** (161,312)\nRole: port city, cultural center, tourist hub\nKnown For: its stunning Diocletian's Palace, beautiful beaches, and lively atmosphere\nBest For: visitors interested in history, beach activities, and nightlife\n\n**Rijeka** (128,314)\nRole: port city, industrial center, cultural hub\nKnown For: its rich history, vibrant cultural scene, and stunning natural surroundings\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n**Osijek** (96,378)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, university town\nKnown For: its beautiful baroque architecture, lively cultural scene, and rich history\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and education\n\n**Zadar** (70,779)\nRole: port city, tourist hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning old town, beautiful beaches, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, beach activities, and cultural exploration\n\n**Dubrovnik** (42,615)\nRole: tourist hub, cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its stunning medieval old town, beautiful beaches, and rich history\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and luxury tourism\n\n**Varaždin** (46,649)\nRole: cultural center, historic city, tourist hub\nKnown For: its stunning baroque architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and beautiful natural surroundings\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Istria | hilly, coastal, tourist-friendly | truffles, wine, beaches | Pula |\n| Dalmatia | coastal, mountainous, historic | Dubrovnik, Split, islands | Split |\n| Slavonia | flat, agricultural, cultural | Osijek, Vukovar, wine | Osijek |\n| Lika-Senj | mountainous, rural, natural | Plitvice Lakes, Velebit Mountains | Gospić |\n| Kvarner | coastal, mountainous, tourist-friendly | Rijeka, Opatija, islands | Rijeka |\n| Zagorje | hilly, rural, cultural | Zagreb, Varaždin, castles | Zagreb |\n| Dubrovnik-Neretva | coastal, historic, tourist-friendly | Dubrovnik, islands, beaches | Dubrovnik |\n| Šibenik-Knin | coastal, historic, cultural | Šibenik, Krka National Park, islands | Šibenik |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Croatia differ significantly in terms of culture, with the coastal regions having a more Mediterranean influence and the inland regions having a more Central European influence.\n- The economy of Croatia's regions varies, with the coastal regions relying heavily on tourism and the inland regions relying on agriculture and industry.\n- The climate of Croatia's regions differs, with the coastal regions having a Mediterranean climate and the inland regions having a continental climate.\n- The language spoken in Croatia's regions is predominantly Croatian, but there are also minority languages spoken in some regions, such as Italian in Istria and Hungarian in Slavonia.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nCroatia has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and ferries connecting the major cities and regions.
