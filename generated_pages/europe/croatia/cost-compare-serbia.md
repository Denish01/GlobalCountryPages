[SECTION] Overview: Croatia vs Serbia [/SECTION]
Croatia and Serbia are two neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living. Croatia, a member of the European Union, has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed tourism industry, which contributes to its higher cost of living. Serbia, on the other hand, has a lower GDP per capita and a more modest economy, resulting in a lower cost of living. The overall cost of living in Croatia is around 20-30% higher than in Serbia, with notable differences in housing, food, and transportation costs.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. Croatia's economy is more service-based, with a strong focus on tourism, while Serbia's economy is more industry-based, with a focus on manufacturing and agriculture. This difference in economic structure contributes to the variations in cost of living between the two countries. Additionally, Croatia's membership in the European Union has led to increased prices for certain goods and services, particularly in the tourism sector.
