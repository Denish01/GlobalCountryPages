[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Iceland's government is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Althing, the national parliament, is a unicameral body composed of 63 members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The President serves as the head of state, while the Prime Minister is the head of government, responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration. Iceland's system of government is **unitary**, with the central government holding significant powers, although local municipalities have some autonomy.

The **principle of direct democracy** is also an essential aspect of Iceland's political system, with citizens having the right to initiate national referendums and participate in **citizens' assemblies**. This approach has been instrumental in shaping key policies, such as the country's **constitution** and its **European Union** membership referendum. The government's commitment to transparency and citizen engagement has contributed to Iceland's high ranking in various **democracy indices**.

Iceland's **electoral system** is based on proportional representation, which ensures that smaller parties have a voice in the Althing. This has led to a **multiparty system**, with several parties represented in the parliament. The **independence of the judiciary** is also a cornerstone of Iceland's political system, with the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal ensuring that the rule of law is upheld.
