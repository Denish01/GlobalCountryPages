        <h2>Visa Policy Overview</h2>
        <p>Iceland has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter without a visa, while others require a visa in advance. As a member of the Schengen Area, Iceland's visa policy is aligned with that of other Schengen countries. Citizens of around 60 countries can enter Iceland visa-free for a maximum stay of 90 days within a 180-day period. This includes citizens of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, among others. However, it's essential to note that visa-free access does not guarantee entry, and travelers must still meet specific requirements, such as having a valid passport and proof of onward travel.</p>
        <p>Iceland's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel and tourism with the need to maintain national security and control immigration. The country's unique natural beauty and growing popularity as a tourist destination have led to an increase in visitor numbers in recent years. As a result, the Icelandic government has implemented measures to manage the flow of tourists and ensure that visitors comply with the country's regulations and respect its environment.</p>
        <h2>Requirements By Nationality</h2>

        <h2>By Visitor Type</h2>
        <p><strong>Tourists:</strong> Tourists can enter Iceland visa-free for a maximum stay of 90 days within a 180-day period.

        <p><strong>Business Travelers:</strong> Business travelers may require a visa, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit. They must provide an invitation letter from an Icelandic company, proof of business activities, and other supporting documents. Business travelers may be required to register with the Icelandic authorities and obtain a residence permit if they plan to stay in the country for an extended period.</p>
        <p><strong>Students:</strong> Students must apply for a residence permit and a student visa to study in Iceland.

Upon arrival, travelers must go through immigration and customs, where they will be required to present their travel documents and answer questions about their stay. Travelers must also declare any goods they are bringing with them, including gifts, food, and other items. It's essential to note that Iceland has strict regulations regarding the importation of certain goods, such as meat and dairy products. Travelers can also enter Iceland by land or sea, but these entry points are less common.</p>
        <p>At immigration, travelers will be required to present their passport and other travel documents, and answer questions about their stay, including the purpose of their visit, their accommodation arrangements, and their plans for onward travel. Travelers may also be asked to provide proof of sufficient funds for their stay and health insurance that covers the entire stay in Iceland. It's essential to ensure that all travel documents are in order and that travelers have all the necessary information and documents to facilitate a smooth entry process.</p>
