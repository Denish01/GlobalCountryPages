[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Iceland's healthcare system is a universal, publicly-funded system that provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens. The system is primarily funded through taxes, and citizens are entitled to a wide range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. The quality of care in Iceland is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. In terms of access, urban areas tend to have more medical facilities and specialists than rural areas, but the country's small size and well-developed transportation network make it relatively easy to access medical care from anywhere in the country. The public healthcare system is supplemented by a private healthcare sector, which offers additional services and faster access to care for those who can afford it.

The Icelandic healthcare system is administered by the Ministry of Welfare, which is responsible for setting healthcare policy and overseeing the provision of medical services. The system is largely decentralized, with most medical services provided by local health clinics and hospitals. The country has a high ratio of doctors to patients, and medical professionals are generally well-trained and experienced. The healthcare system is also supported by a network of community health services, including home care and rehabilitation services.

Iceland's healthcare system has been consistently ranked as one of the best in the world, with high ratings for quality, accessibility, and patient satisfaction. The country has a strong focus on preventive care, with a range of programs and services aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing illness. Overall, Iceland's healthcare system is a model of excellence, providing high-quality, comprehensive care to all citizens.
