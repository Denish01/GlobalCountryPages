[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Iceland is easily accessible by air, with Keflavik International Airport (KEF) being the main gateway for international flights. The airport is located about 50 kilometers west of the capital city Reykjavik and offers direct flights to many European and North American destinations. Some of the major airlines that operate direct flights to Iceland include Icelandair, Wow Air, and Delta Air Lines. If you're planning to drive to Iceland, you can take a ferry from Denmark or the UK, but this option is less common and usually more time-consuming.

Reykjavik is also a popular port of call for cruise ships, and many passengers use this opportunity to explore the city and its surroundings. For those who prefer to travel by land and sea, there are also ferry services available from Denmark and the UK, although these routes are less frequent and often more expensive than flying. Additionally, Iceland has several smaller airports that cater to domestic flights and private charters, making it easier to explore the country's more remote areas.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Iceland has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between Reykjavik and other parts of the country. The main domestic airlines are Icelandair and Eagle Air, which offer regular flights to destinations such as Akureyri, Egilsstadir, and Hofn. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be relatively high. A one-way ticket can cost anywhere from $100 to $300, depending on the route and time of year. It's also worth noting that some domestic flights may involve a short layover in Reykjavik, so be sure to check the itinerary before booking.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Iceland has no rail network, which makes it one of the few countries in Europe without a railway system. As a result, trains are not an option for getting around the country, and visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation such as buses, cars, or flights. However, there are some tourist trains and scenic railways that operate in certain areas, such as the **Icelandic Wagon Trails**, which offer a unique way to explore the countryside.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Iceland has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity routes and sightseeing tours. The main bus companies are Strætó, Reykjavik Excursions, and SBA-Norðurleið, which offer regular services to destinations such as the Golden Circle, South Coast, and Akureyri. The quality of the buses is generally good, with comfortable seating and ample luggage space. Prices vary depending on the route and operator, but a one-way ticket can cost anywhere from $10 to $50. It's also possible to buy a **bus pass**, which can be a convenient and cost-effective way to explore the country.
