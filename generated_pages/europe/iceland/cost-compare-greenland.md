[SECTION] Overview: Iceland vs Greenland [/SECTION]
Iceland and Greenland are two Nordic countries with distinct economic profiles. Iceland has a high-income economy, driven by tourism, fishing, and renewable energy, while Greenland's economy is primarily based on fishing and subsidies from Denmark. The cost of living in Iceland is significantly higher than in Greenland, mainly due to the country's remote location and limited self-sufficiency. In contrast, Greenland's cost of living is relatively lower, but still higher than in many other countries, due to its harsh climate and limited connectivity.

The overall cost of living in Iceland is around 20-30% higher than in Greenland, making it a more expensive destination for expats, tourists, and locals alike. However, both countries offer unique experiences and opportunities, and the cost difference may be worth it for those who value Iceland's vibrant culture, stunning landscapes, and high standard of living. On the other hand, Greenland offers a more laid-back and traditional way of life, with a strong sense of community and a unique cultural heritage.
