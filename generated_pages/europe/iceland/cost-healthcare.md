[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Iceland's healthcare system is universal, providing comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents. The system is primarily publicly funded, with a small private sector catering to those who prefer additional services or shorter wait times. For locals, the system is generally efficient, with easy access to medical care and a wide range of services covered. However, foreigners may face some challenges navigating the system, particularly if they do not speak Icelandic. It is recommended that visitors and expats purchase health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses, as some services may not be fully covered by the public system.

The quality of healthcare in Iceland is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between public and private providers. Public healthcare services are generally of high quality, but may have longer wait times for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, may offer more personalized care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. It is essential for foreigners to research and understand the healthcare system in Iceland, including the services covered by the public system and the options available for private care.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 112, for immediate assistance.
