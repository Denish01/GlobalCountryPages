[SECTION] Overview: Iceland vs Norway [/SECTION]
Iceland and Norway are both Nordic countries with high standards of living, but they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Iceland has a smaller economy and a more limited job market, which can drive up prices for goods and services. In contrast, Norway has a larger and more diversified economy, with a strong focus on oil and gas production, which contributes to its higher GDP per capita. As a result, Norway tends to have lower prices for many everyday items, making it a more affordable option for expats and travelers.

The cost of living in Iceland is particularly high due to its remote location and limited imports, which can make everyday items like food and clothing more expensive. Additionally, Iceland's popularity as a tourist destination has driven up prices for accommodation and activities, making it challenging for visitors to find affordable options. In contrast, Norway has a more developed infrastructure and a larger population, which can help to keep prices lower. However, Norway's high taxes and strict labor laws can also drive up costs for certain goods and services, such as food and transportation.
