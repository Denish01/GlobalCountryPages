# Iceland Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Iceland before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Iceland has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter without a visa, while others require a visa in advance. As a member of the Schengen Area, Iceland's visa policy is aligned with that of other Schengen countries. Citizens of around 60 countries can enter Iceland visa-free for a maximum stay of 90 days within a 180-day period. This includes citizens of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, among others. However, it's essential to note that visa-free access does not guarantee entry, and travelers must still meet specific requirements, such as having a valid passport and proof of onward travel.

Iceland's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel and tourism with the need to maintain national security and control immigration. The country's unique natural beauty and growing popularity as a tourist destination have led to an increase in visitor numbers in recent years. As a result, the Icelandic government has implemented measures to manage the flow of tourists and ensure that visitors comply with the country's regulations and respect its environment.
