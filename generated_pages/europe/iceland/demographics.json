The population is predominantly urban, with around 93.7% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Reykjavik and its surrounding municipalities. The country's population growth is driven by a combination of natural increase and net migration, with a significant number of foreigners moving to Iceland for work or education. The population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow pace, due to the country's high standard of living, excellent education system, and stunning natural environment.\n\nThe population of Iceland is also characterized by a high level of education and a strong economy, with a high percentage of the workforce employed in the service sector. The country's unique cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty also make it an attractive destination for tourists, with a significant number of visitors arriving each year. However, the population growth and urbanization also pose challenges, such as housing shortages and pressure on public services, particularly in the capital city.\n\nIceland's population is also aging, with a median age of 37.5 years, which is higher than the European average. This demographic trend is expected to continue, with significant implications for the country's pension system, healthcare, and social services.
