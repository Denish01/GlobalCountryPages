  "content": "Healthcare costs in Iceland are generally high, with an average health expenditure per capita of $7,642, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 14.9% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $7,642\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 14.9%\nHealthcare System: Universal\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Yes\nCurrency: ISK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nIceland's healthcare system is universal, providing comprehensive coverage to all citizens and residents. The system is primarily publicly funded, with a small private sector catering to those who prefer additional services or shorter wait times. For locals, the system is generally efficient, with easy access to medical care and a wide range of services covered. However, foreigners may face some challenges navigating the system, particularly if they do not speak Icelandic. It is recommended that visitors and expats purchase health insurance to cover any unexpected medical expenses, as some services may not be fully covered by the public system.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Iceland is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between public and private providers. Public healthcare services are generally of high quality, but may have longer wait times for non-emergency procedures. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, may offer more personalized care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. It is essential for foreigners to research and understand the healthcare system in Iceland, including the services covered by the public system and the options available for private care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $30-$50 | $100-$150 | Public sector prices vary by location |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $200-$300 | Private sector prices may include additional tests or services |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Public sector prices may not include additional procedures |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private sector prices may include additional tests or services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public sector prices may vary by location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Public sector prices may vary by location |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Private sector prices may include additional services or amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Public sector prices may vary by procedure and location |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | Private sector prices may include additional services or amenities |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | Public sector prices may vary by location |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Private sector prices may include additional tests or services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public sector services, including GP visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private sector services, including specialist consultations and additional tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-$300 | Emergency medical evacuation, repatriation, and other international services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies, with prices varying by medication and brand.\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics may cost between $10-$50.\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with some medications requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Pharmacies are widely available, particularly in urban areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are generally available without a prescription, but may be more expensive than in other countries.\n- Some medications may be subsidized by the public healthcare system, reducing the cost to patients.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 112, for immediate assistance.
