[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Iceland has a relatively small population, and as a result, the public transportation system is not as extensive as in other European countries. However, the main transportation modes in Iceland include buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit is generally good, with modern buses and a reliable schedule. Most people in Iceland get around by driving their own cars, as the country's geography and lack of public transportation in rural areas make it difficult to rely solely on public transport. The capital city, Reykjavik, has a more comprehensive public transportation system, with buses connecting the city center to the surrounding neighborhoods and suburbs.

The bus system in Iceland is operated by several companies, including Strætó and Reykjavik Excursions, which offer routes throughout the country. The buses are modern and comfortable, with free Wi-Fi and ample legroom. However, the frequency of buses can be limited in rural areas, and it's often necessary to plan ahead and book tickets in advance. Taxis and ride-hailing services are also widely available, although they can be more expensive than public transportation. Ride-hailing apps like BSR, Hopp, and CabDirect are popular in Reykjavik and offer a convenient way to get around the city.
