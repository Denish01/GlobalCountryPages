# The Truth About Iceland - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Iceland was first inhabited by Viking settlers in the late 9th century. The first permanent settler is believed to be **Ingólfur Arnarson**, a Norwegian Viking who arrived in 870 AD. The **Althing**, Iceland's national parliament, was established in 930 AD, making it one of the oldest parliaments in the world. Iceland was a free state until 1262, when it entered into a union with Norway. In 1380, Iceland, along with Norway, came under Danish rule. This union lasted for nearly 600 years, until Iceland gained home rule in 1918. On June 17, 1944, Iceland declared its independence from Denmark and became a **sovereign republic**.

The country's early history is well-documented in the **Icelandic Sagas**, a collection of medieval manuscripts that tell the stories of the Vikings and their descendants. These sagas provide valuable insights into the country's language, culture, and customs. Iceland's unique **cultural heritage** is a result of its Viking roots and its geographical isolation.

In 1918, Iceland was granted home rule, but it wasn't until 1944 that the country declared its full independence.
