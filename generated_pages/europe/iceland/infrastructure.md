[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Iceland's infrastructure development level is high, with significant investments in recent years to improve and expand its transportation networks, energy systems, and public services. The country's unique geography and climate pose challenges, but the government has implemented various initiatives to address these issues and ensure that all citizens have access to essential services. There is a notable urban-rural gap in infrastructure development, with the capital city Reykjavik and surrounding areas having better access to services and amenities than rural regions. However, efforts are being made to bridge this gap and provide equal opportunities for all citizens.

Iceland's infrastructure is also characterized by a strong focus on sustainability and environmental protection. The country aims to be carbon neutral by 2040 and has made significant progress in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. This is reflected in its energy sector, where **geothermal power** and **hydroelectric power** are the primary sources of electricity. The government has also implemented policies to promote the use of renewable energy, increase energy efficiency, and reduce waste.

Despite the challenges posed by its remote location, Iceland's infrastructure is well-connected to the rest of the world. The country has a modern transportation system, with several international airports and seaports that facilitate the import and export of goods. The lack of a rail network is compensated by a well-developed road network, which connects all major towns and cities.
