[SECTION] Overview: Iceland vs United Kingdom [/SECTION]
Iceland and the United Kingdom are two distinct countries with different economic contexts, which impact their cost of living. Iceland is a small, island nation with a highly developed economy, while the United Kingdom is a larger, more diverse country with a broader range of industries. The cost of living in Iceland is generally higher due to its remote location, limited natural resources, and high demand for imported goods. In contrast, the United Kingdom has a more extensive range of affordable options, particularly in larger cities like London. On average, the cost of living in Iceland is around 20-30% higher than in the United Kingdom.

The main factors contributing to the higher cost of living in Iceland include housing, food, and transportation. The country's unique geography and harsh climate make it challenging to produce and transport goods, resulting in higher prices for everyday items. Additionally, Iceland's strong economy and high standard of living have driven up demand for housing, particularly in the capital city of Reykjavik. In contrast, the United Kingdom has a more established infrastructure and a larger market, which helps to keep prices competitive. However, it's essential to note that both countries have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and the cost of living can vary significantly depending on individual lifestyles and preferences.
