[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
Iceland has one of the best internet infrastructures in the world, with an average internet speed of 155 Mbps download. The country's small size and low population density have allowed for a high level of investment in telecommunications, resulting in a reliable and fast internet connection throughout the country. While there is a slight divide between urban and rural areas, with cities like Reykjavik tend to have faster speeds and more reliable connections, the overall quality of the internet is still very high. The reliability of the internet in Iceland is also noteworthy, with minimal downtime and a robust network that can handle high demand.

The internet quality in Iceland is also reflected in the country's high ranking in terms of internet penetration, with over 95% of the population having access to the internet. This has enabled the country to develop a strong digital economy, with many businesses and services available online. Additionally, the Icelandic government has invested heavily in digital infrastructure, including the development of a national fiber-optic network, which has further improved the country's internet connectivity.
