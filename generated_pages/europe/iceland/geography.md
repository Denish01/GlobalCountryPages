The **Vatnajökull** glacier, Europe's largest glacier, covers over 8% of the country's land area.

Iceland's coastline is equally impressive, with a mix of **fjords**, **bays**, and **black sand beaches**. The **Westfjords** region in the northwest is known for its rugged and remote landscape, with numerous **fjords** and **glaciers**. The southern coast is more populated, with the capital city **Reykjavik** located on the southwestern shore.
