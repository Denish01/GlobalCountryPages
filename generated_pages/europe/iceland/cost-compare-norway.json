  "content": "Iceland is generally more expensive than Norway, with a difference of around 10-20% in overall cost of living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nIceland GDP per Capita (PPP): $52,150\nNorway GDP per Capita (PPP): $70,591\nIceland Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nNorway Inflation Rate: 1.8%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Norway\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Iceland vs Norway [/SECTION]\nIceland and Norway are both Nordic countries with high standards of living, but they have distinct economic contexts that affect their cost of living. Iceland has a smaller economy and a more limited job market, which can drive up prices for goods and services. In contrast, Norway has a larger and more diversified economy, with a strong focus on oil and gas production, which contributes to its higher GDP per capita. As a result, Norway tends to have lower prices for many everyday items, making it a more affordable option for expats and travelers.\n\nThe cost of living in Iceland is particularly high due to its remote location and limited imports, which can make everyday items like food and clothing more expensive. Additionally, Iceland's popularity as a tourist destination has driven up prices for accommodation and activities, making it challenging for visitors to find affordable options. In contrast, Norway has a more developed infrastructure and a larger population, which can help to keep prices lower. However, Norway's high taxes and strict labor laws can also drive up costs for certain goods and services, such as food and transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iceland (USD) | Norway (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $1,200 | $1,000 | 20% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $900 | $700 | 28% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $2,500 | $2,000 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iceland (USD) | Norway (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $20 | $15 | 33% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $800 | $600 | 33% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | $8 | $6 | 33% more expensive |\n| Coffee | $5 | $4 | 25% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iceland (USD) | Norway (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $100 | $80 | 25% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2.50 | $2.00 | 25% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.80 | $1.50 | 20% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iceland (USD) | Norway (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $150 | $120 | 25% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $50 | $40 | 25% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | $30 | $25 | 20% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iceland (USD) | Norway (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $2,500 | $2,000 | 20% |\n| Mid-Range | $3,500 | $2,800 | 21% |\n| Comfortable | $5,000 | $4,000 | 20% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iceland is cheaper for:**\n- Outdoor activities like hiking and camping, which are generally free or low-cost\n- Unique cultural experiences, such as visiting the Blue Lagoon or attending a music festival\n- High-end shopping, with a range of luxury boutiques and designer stores\n- Whale watching and other marine tours, which can be less expensive than in Norway\n- **Norway is cheaper for:**\n- Food and groceries, with a wider range of affordable options\n- Transportation, with a more developed public transit system and lower fuel prices\n- Accommodation, with a larger range of affordable housing options\n- Utilities and internet, with lower prices for basic services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIceland and Norway are both unique and attractive destinations, but they cater to different lifestyles and priorities.
