[SECTION] How Iceland Is Divided [/SECTION]
Iceland is divided into 8 regions, each with its own unique character and attractions. These regions are further subdivided into 23 counties and 79 municipalities. The country's administrative structure is relatively straightforward, with the capital city of Reykjavik serving as the center of government and commerce. The regions are largely defined by their geographical features, such as the coastal areas, the highlands, and the glaciers.

The division of Iceland into regions is also influenced by the country's history and culture. For example, the region of Suðurland is home to many of Iceland's most famous natural wonders, including the Gullfoss waterfall and the Geysir geothermal area. In contrast, the region of Vestfirðir is known for its rugged coastline and traditional fishing villages.
