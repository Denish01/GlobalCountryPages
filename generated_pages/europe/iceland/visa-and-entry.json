[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nIceland has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter without a visa, while others require a visa in advance. As a member of the Schengen Area, Iceland's visa policy is aligned with that of other Schengen countries. Citizens of around 60 countries can enter Iceland visa-free for a maximum stay of 90 days within a 180-day period. This includes citizens of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, among others. However, it's essential to note that visa-free access does not guarantee entry, and travelers must still meet specific requirements, such as having a valid passport and proof of onward travel.\n\nIceland's visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel and tourism with the need to maintain national security and control immigration. The country's unique natural beauty and growing popularity as a tourist destination have led to an increase in visitor numbers in recent years. As a result, the Icelandic government has implemented measures to manage the flow of tourists and ensure that visitors comply with the country's regulations and respect its environment.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport or national ID card |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 90 days | Must apply for a visa in advance through the Icelandic embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 90 days | Must apply for a visa in advance through the Icelandic embassy or consulate |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Iceland visa-free for a maximum stay of 90 days within a 180-day period.
