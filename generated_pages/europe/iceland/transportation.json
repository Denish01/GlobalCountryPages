  "content": "To get around in Iceland, you can use a combination of flights, buses, and car rentals, as the country has a well-developed transportation network that caters to its unique landscape and relatively small population.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Keflavik International Airport (KEF)\nDomestic Air Network: moderate\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: Bolt, local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nIceland is easily accessible by air, with Keflavik International Airport (KEF) being the main gateway for international flights. The airport is located about 50 kilometers west of the capital city Reykjavik and offers direct flights to many European and North American destinations. Some of the major airlines that operate direct flights to Iceland include Icelandair, Wow Air, and Delta Air Lines. If you're planning to drive to Iceland, you can take a ferry from Denmark or the UK, but this option is less common and usually more time-consuming.\n\nReykjavik is also a popular port of call for cruise ships, and many passengers use this opportunity to explore the city and its surroundings. For those who prefer to travel by land and sea, there are also ferry services available from Denmark and the UK, although these routes are less frequent and often more expensive than flying. Additionally, Iceland has several smaller airports that cater to domestic flights and private charters, making it easier to explore the country's more remote areas.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nIceland has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between Reykjavik and other parts of the country. The main domestic airlines are Icelandair and Eagle Air, which offer regular flights to destinations such as Akureyri, Egilsstadir, and Hofn. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be relatively high. A one-way ticket can cost anywhere from $100 to $300, depending on the route and time of year. It's also worth noting that some domestic flights may involve a short layover in Reykjavik, so be sure to check the itinerary before booking.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nIceland has no rail network, which makes it one of the few countries in Europe without a railway system. As a result, trains are not an option for getting around the country, and visitors will need to rely on other modes of transportation such as buses, cars, or flights. However, there are some tourist trains and scenic railways that operate in certain areas, such as the **Icelandic Wagon Trails**, which offer a unique way to explore the countryside.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIceland has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity routes and sightseeing tours. The main bus companies are Strætó, Reykjavik Excursions, and SBA-Norðurleið, which offer regular services to destinations such as the Golden Circle, South Coast, and Akureyri. The quality of the buses is generally good, with comfortable seating and ample luggage space. Prices vary depending on the route and operator, but a one-way ticket can cost anywhere from $10 to $50. It's also possible to buy a **bus pass**, which can be a convenient and cost-effective way to explore the country.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | none | - | Iceland has no metro or subway system |\n| City Bus | Reykjavik, Akureyri | $3-$5 | Strætó operates regular bus services in Reykjavik and Akureyri |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $2-$3/km | Taxis are widely available, but can be expensive |\n| Ride-Hailing | Reykjavik, Akureyri | $10-$20 | Bolt and local alternatives operate in major cities |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | none | - | Not available in Iceland |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Iceland, you'll need a valid **driver's license** from your home country, as well as a credit card to rent a car.\n- The road quality in Iceland is generally good, but some roads can be narrow and winding, especially in rural areas.\n- Fuel costs can be high in Iceland, so it's a good idea to budget accordingly and consider renting a fuel-efficient vehicle.\n- Car rental companies such as **Avis**, **Hertz**, and **Europcar** operate in Iceland, and it's recommended to book in advance to ensure availability.\n- When driving in Iceland, be aware of the unique road conditions, such as **gravel roads** and **single-lane bridges**, and take necessary precautions to stay safe.\n- It's also important to check the **weather forecast** before embarking on a road trip, as Iceland's weather can be unpredictable and hazardous.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced taxi rides or fake tour operators.\n- Use a **credit card** or **debit card** to pay for transportation services, as cash may not be accepted everywhere.\n- Download the **Strætó** app to plan your bus routes and track your journey in real-time.\n- Consider purchasing a **bus pass** or **travel card** to save money on transportation costs.\n- Be prepared for **delays** or **cancellations** due to weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances.\n- Respect Iceland's unique **environment** and **wildlife** by following local guidelines and regulations.\n- Learn some basic **Icelandic phrases**, such as \"þakka þér\" (thank you), to show appreciation for the local culture and hospitality.\n- Stay **informed** about road conditions and weather forecasts to stay safe and plan your itinerary accordingly.",
