[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Iceland's housing market is characterized by high demand and limited supply, particularly in the capital city of Reykjavik. The rental market is highly competitive, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months. Deposits are usually equivalent to one to two months' rent, and tenants have relatively strong rights, with protection against unfair eviction and rent increases. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Greenland and the United Kingdom, Iceland's housing costs are among the highest, reflecting the country's unique combination of natural beauty, limited land availability, and high standard of living.

The high cost of housing in Iceland is driven by a range of factors, including the country's remote location, limited construction capacity, and strong demand from tourists and expatriates. As a result, renters and buyers must be prepared to pay a premium for accommodation in desirable locations. However, the country's stunning natural beauty, vibrant culture, and high quality of life make it an attractive destination for many, despite the high costs. Renters can expect to pay around 30-40% of their income on housing, although this can vary depending on individual circumstances and lifestyle choices.
