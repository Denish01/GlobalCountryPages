However, the main transportation modes in Iceland include buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit is generally good, with modern buses and a reliable schedule. Most people in Iceland get around by driving their own cars, as the country's geography and lack of public transportation in rural areas make it difficult to rely solely on public transport. The capital city, Reykjavik, has a more comprehensive public transportation system, with buses connecting the city center to the surrounding neighborhoods and suburbs.\n\nThe bus system in Iceland is operated by several companies, including Strætó and Reykjavik Excursions, which offer routes throughout the country. The buses are modern and comfortable, with free Wi-Fi and ample legroom. However, the frequency of buses can be limited in rural areas, and it's often necessary to plan ahead and book tickets in advance. Taxis and ride-hailing services are also widely available, although they can be more expensive than public transportation. Ride-hailing apps like BSR, Hopp, and CabDirect are popular in Reykjavik and offer a convenient way to get around the city.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $3-$4 | $134 | Good coverage in Reykjavik, limited in rural areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Iceland |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $10-$15 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in rural areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Iceland |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $8-$10 | $2-$3 | $15-$25 | Available throughout the country |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5-$7 | $1.50-$2.50 | $10-$20 | BSR, Hopp, and CabDirect available in Reykjavik |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $40-$60 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $2.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $2.20 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-$100 | Economy car, depending on the rental company and season |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking spaces in Reykjavik, free parking in rural areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Some roads, like the Ring Road, have tolls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $30-$60 | Reykjavik to Akureyri or Hofn |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Reykjavik to Akureyri or Egilsstadir |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Iceland |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass or using ride-hailing apps instead of taxis.\n- Download the Strætó or Reykjavik Excursions app to plan your bus route and track your journey in real-time.\n- Be aware of the limited public transportation options in rural areas and plan ahead to avoid getting stranded.\n- Always negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before starting your journey, especially for longer trips.\n- Consider renting a car for a day or two to explore the countryside, but be mindful of the high fuel costs and limited parking options.\n- Use the BSR, Hopp, or CabDirect app to book a ride-hailing service, which can be more convenient and affordable than taxis.",
