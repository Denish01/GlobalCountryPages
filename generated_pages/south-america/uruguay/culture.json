The country's strategic location on the Atlantic coast, bordering Argentina and Brazil, has also contributed to its cultural diversity. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Uruguay is predominantly Spanish-speaking, with a small but significant African and indigenous influence. The country has a strong sense of national pride and a relaxed attitude towards life, which is often referred to as \"Uruguayan tranquility.\" This unique cultural blend has given rise to a distinct Uruguayan identity, which is characterized by its warm hospitality, love of music and dance, and strong sense of community.\n\nUruguay's cultural identity is also shaped by its history, which has been marked by periods of immigration, colonization, and independence. The country's struggle for independence from Spain in the early 19th century had a profound impact on its cultural development, as it led to the creation of a distinct Uruguayan identity that was separate from its European roots.
