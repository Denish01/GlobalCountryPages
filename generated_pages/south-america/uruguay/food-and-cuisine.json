The country's **gauchos**, or cowboys, have played a significant role in shaping the national cuisine, with their traditional **asado** barbecues and **parrilladas** (grilled meats) remaining popular to this day. Regional variations can be seen in the different departments, or provinces, of Uruguay, with the coastal areas specializing in fresh seafood and the inland regions focusing on meat and dairy products. The country's cuisine is also known for its **merienda**, a mid-afternoon snack that typically consists of coffee, tea, or **mate**, a traditional caffeinated drink, accompanied by sweet or savory pastries.\n\nThe key influences on Uruguayan cuisine can be seen in its use of **pasta**, **pizza**, and other Italian staples, as well as its **empanadas**, **tortas fritas**, and other Spanish-inspired dishes. The country's **ferias**, or street fairs, often feature traditional foods like **choripan**, a grilled sausage sandwich, and **provoleta**, a melted provolone cheese dish. Uruguayan cuisine is also known for its **postres**, or desserts, which often feature **dulce de leche**, a sweet caramel-like sauce made from sweetened condensed milk.\n\nUruguay's food culture is also shaped by its **estancias**, or ranches, which offer traditional **asado** experiences and **cabalgatas**, or horseback rides, through the countryside. Visitors can sample local specialties like **carne asada**, or grilled beef, and **chorizo**, a spicy sausage, while learning about the country's rich **gaucho** heritage. The country's **vino**, or wine, is also worth trying, with many **bodegas**, or wineries, offering tours and tastings.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description |
