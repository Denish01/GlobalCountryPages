[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Uruguay's tax system is based on a territorial taxation principle, where individuals and companies are taxed on their income earned within the country. This means that individuals who are residents of Uruguay are taxed on their worldwide income, but non-residents are only taxed on their Uruguayan-sourced income. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must have a permanent home in Uruguay, or spend more than 183 days in the country in a calendar year.

The Uruguayan tax system is administered by the **Dirección General Impositiva (DGI)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax guidance to individuals and businesses. Uruguay has a relatively complex tax system, with multiple tax rates and exemptions, so it's essential to seek professional advice to ensure compliance with all tax laws and regulations.
