The language of instruction is Spanish, and compulsory education lasts for 14 years, from preschool to the end of secondary school. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, and the quality of education is considered to be high. Private schools, on the other hand, offer an alternative for those who can afford it, with some institutions offering bilingual or international curricula. International schools are also available, mainly in the capital city of Montevideo, catering to the expat community and offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate.\n\nThe education system in Uruguay is divided into several stages, including preschool, primary school, secondary school, and higher education. The public education system is overseen by the Ministry of Education and Culture, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards and overseeing the administration of schools. Private schools, on the other hand, are regulated by the Ministry of Education and Culture, but have more autonomy in terms of curriculum and administration. International schools in Uruguay offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate, the British curriculum, and the American curriculum, among others.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, Spanish language of instruction |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of quality, bilingual or international curricula available |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, Spanish language of instruction |\n| Private Secondary | $3,000-$7,000 | Range of quality, bilingual or international curricula available |\n| International School | $8,000-$15,000 | International curricula, English language of instruction, high-quality facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $0 (free) | $2,000-$5,000 | High-quality education, Spanish language of instruction |\n| Private University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Range of quality, bilingual or international curricula available |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000-$10,000 | $8,000-$15,000 | Universidad de la República, high-quality education, Spanish language of instruction |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Range of quality, Spanish language of instruction |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Range of quality, subjects, and languages available |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Spanish language courses, range of quality and levels available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100-$300 | Basic supplies, range of quality and prices available |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Mandatory in some schools, range of quality and prices available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The education system in Uruguay is considered to be of high quality, with a strong emphasis on public education.\n- Expats often choose to send their children to international schools, which offer a range of curricula and languages.\n- Scholarships are available for local and international students, particularly for postgraduate studies.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular, with some universities offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The quality of education in Uruguay is considered to be higher than in many other countries in the region, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and critical thinking.\n- [CALLOUT] It is recommended to research and visit schools before making a decision, as the quality and prices can vary significantly.",
