  "content": "The official language spoken in Uruguay is Spanish, and it is the primary language used for communication in all aspects of life, from government and education to business and everyday conversation.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Spanish\nWidely Spoken: Portuguese, English\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nUruguay's linguistic landscape is dominated by Spanish, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. The country's geographical location, nestled between Argentina and Brazil, has led to the influence of other languages, particularly Portuguese, which is widely spoken in the north. However, Spanish remains the primary language used in all official contexts, including government, education, and media. Regional dialects exist, with the most notable being the Rioplatense dialect, which is spoken in the capital city of Montevideo and is similar to the dialect spoken in Buenos Aires, Argentina. English is not as widely spoken as in other South American countries, but it is still understood by many in the tourism and business sectors.\n\nDespite the prevalence of Spanish, there are minority languages spoken in Uruguay, including Portuguese and Italian, which are spoken by immigrant communities. However, these languages are not widely spoken outside of specific communities, and Spanish remains the primary language used for communication. English is becoming more widely spoken, particularly among younger people and those in the tourism industry, but it is still not as widely understood as in other countries.\n\nThe level of English proficiency in Uruguay is moderate, with many people able to understand and speak basic English, particularly in tourist areas. However, it is still a good idea to learn some basic Spanish phrases to help navigate the country and communicate with locals. Many Uruguayans appreciate the effort to speak Spanish, and it can go a long way in enhancing the travel experience.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola | OH-lah | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Gracias | GRAH-see-ahs | formal/informal |\n| Please | Por favor | paw-FAH-vor | formal/informal |\n| Yes / No | Sí / No | SEE / NOH | formal/informal |\n| Excuse me | Con permiso | kohn pehr-MEE-soh | formal |\n| How much? | Cuánto cuesta | KWAHN-toh KWEHS-tah | formal/informal |\n| Where is...? | Dónde está...? | DOHN-deh EH-stah | formal/informal |\n| I don't understand | No entiendo | noh ehn-tee-EHN-doh | formal/informal |\n| Do you speak English? | ¿Habla inglés? | AHB-lah eeng-lee-EHZ | formal/informal |\n| Help! | ¡Ayuda! | ah-YOO-dah | formal/informal |\n| Goodbye | Adiós | ah-DEE-yos | formal/informal |\n| Sorry | Lo siento | LOH see-en-toh | formal/informal |\n| How are you? | ¿Cómo estás? | KOH-moh eh-STAH | formal/informal |\n| What's your name? | ¿Cómo te llamas? | KOH-moh teh YAH-mahs | formal/informal |\n| I'm lost | Estoy perdido | eh-STOH pehr-DEE-thoh | formal/informal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Uno | oo-noh |\n| 2 | Dos | dohs |\n| 3 | Tres | trays |\n| 4 | Cuatro | kwah-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | sing-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | say-is |\n| 7 | Siete | see-eht-eh |\n| 8 | Ocho | oh-choh |\n| 9 | Nueve | nway-vay |\n| 10 | Diez | dee-ez |\n| 100 | Cien | see-EHN |\n| 1000 | Mil | meel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it's customary to use formal language, such as using the formal \"you\" (usted) instead of the informal \"you\" (tú).\n- Uruguayans tend to be friendly and welcoming, but they also value personal space and physical touch is generally reserved for close friends and family.\n- Gestures such as waving goodbye or beckoning someone with the palm facing upwards are common in Uruguay.\n- Avoid using gestures that involve the hands, such as pointing or waving, as these can be seen as rude.\n- When asking for help or directions, it's a good idea to approach someone who appears to be a local, such as a shopkeeper or a police officer.\n- Uruguayans tend to be patient and willing to help, so don't be afraid to ask for assistance if you need it.\n- When communicating with locals, try to speak clearly and slowly, and avoid using complex vocabulary or idioms.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Google Translate is a useful app for translating Spanish phrases on the go.\n- Phrasebooks and dictionaries can be helpful for learning basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Many Uruguayans appreciate the effort to learn Spanish, so consider taking a language course or using online resources to learn the basics before traveling.\n- For more complex translations, consider hiring a professional translator or using a translation service.\n- The Uruguayan government also provides some tourist information in English, including maps and brochures, which can be helpful for navigating the country.",
