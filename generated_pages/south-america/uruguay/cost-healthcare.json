  "content": "In Uruguay, the cost of healthcare can range from $20 to $200 for a doctor's visit, depending on whether you choose public or private healthcare, with the overall health expenditure per capita being $2,076 as of 2023.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,076 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 17.1% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 105\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: UYU\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nUruguay has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is available to all citizens, including foreigners who have obtained residency. The public system is funded through a combination of government funding and social security contributions. Private healthcare, on the other hand, is also widely available and is often preferred by those who can afford it, as it typically offers shorter wait times and more modern facilities. For locals, the healthcare system is generally easy to navigate, with many healthcare professionals speaking Spanish as their primary language. For foreigners, it may be more challenging, but many private healthcare providers have English-speaking staff, and some even offer translation services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Uruguay is generally well-regarded, with a strong emphasis on preventative care and a wide range of specialized services available. However, as with any healthcare system, there are pros and cons to consider. The public system can be slow, with long wait times for non-emergency procedures, while the private system can be expensive. Additionally, some medical specialties may not be available in all areas of the country, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, Uruguay's healthcare system is generally considered to be one of the best in South America, with high-quality care available to those who need it.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, specialized procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Worldwide coverage, including Uruguay, with comprehensive benefits and emergency evacuation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally affordable, with prices ranging from $5 to $50 for a month's supply.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available and relatively inexpensive, with prices ranging from $2 to $10.\n- Pharmacies are common in urban areas, but may be less available in rural areas.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a Uruguayan doctor, even if you have a prescription from your home country.\n- Generic medications are often available and can be significantly cheaper than brand-name medications.\n- Some pharmacies may offer delivery or online ordering services, making it easier to get the medications you need.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, you should call 105, the local emergency number, or go to the nearest hospital. Ambulances are available, but may not always be equipped with the latest medical technology. The best hospitals for foreigners are typically private hospitals, which often have English-speaking staff and more modern facilities. Some of the top private hospitals in Uruguay include the British Hospital, the Spanish Hospital, and the Italian Hospital. These hospitals offer a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, surgery, and specialized treatments. It's a good idea to research these hospitals and their services before you need them, so you know where to go in case of an emergency. Additionally, many private hospitals have international accreditation and are recognized by international insurance companies, making it easier to get the care you need if you have insurance.",
