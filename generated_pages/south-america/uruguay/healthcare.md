[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Uruguay's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all citizens have access to medical care, regardless of their income or social status. The public healthcare system is managed by the Ministry of Public Health, and it provides a wide range of services, including primary care, specialized care, and hospitalization. The public system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained professionals and modern equipment. However, there may be some waiting times for non-emergency procedures. In addition to the public system, there are also many private healthcare providers, including hospitals, clinics, and medical centers, which offer high-quality care and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost.

The quality of care in Uruguay is generally good, with many medical professionals having received training in Europe or North America. Urban areas, such as Montevideo, tend to have better access to healthcare services and specialized care, while rural areas may have more limited options. However, the government has made efforts to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the establishment of community health centers and mobile health units.

Overall, Uruguay's healthcare system is well-regarded, and it is considered to be one of the best in South America. The country has a high life expectancy, low infant mortality rates, and good control of infectious diseases. However, as with any healthcare system, there are some challenges, including long waiting times for non-emergency procedures and a shortage of certain medical specialties.
