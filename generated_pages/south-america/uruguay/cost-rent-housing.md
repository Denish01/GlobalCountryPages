[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Uruguay's housing market is characterized by a mix of modern and colonial-style buildings, with a strong demand for rentals in the capital city of Montevideo. The rental market is relatively stable, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months, and a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are well-protected in Uruguay, with laws governing rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Uruguay's housing costs are slightly higher than those in Argentina, but lower than those in Brazil. The country's relatively high **GDP per capita** and **low inflation rate** contribute to a stable and attractive housing market for expats and locals alike.

The housing market in Uruguay is also influenced by the country's **education spend** and **health expenditure**, which are relatively high compared to other countries in the region. This has led to a high demand for housing in areas with good access to schools and healthcare facilities. Additionally, the country's **out-of-pocket health spend** is relatively low, which means that many Uruguayans have more disposable income to spend on housing. As a result, the housing market in Uruguay is relatively buoyant, with a wide range of options available for renters and buyers.
