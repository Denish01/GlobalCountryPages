[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Uruguay is easily accessible by air, with Carrasco International Airport (MVD) in Montevideo being the main entry point for most visitors. The airport is served by several major airlines, including American Airlines, LATAM, and Aerolineas Argentinas, with direct flights from key hubs such as Miami, Buenos Aires, and Santiago. You can also enter Uruguay overland from neighboring Argentina and Brazil, with several border crossings available, including the busy border town of Fray Bentos.

If you're coming from elsewhere in South America, you may also consider taking a bus or a ferry, with several companies operating services from Argentina and Brazil. The ferry ride from Buenos Aires to Montevideo, for example, takes around 8 hours and offers a scenic route along the Rio de la Plata. Alternatively, you can take a bus from major cities such as Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, which can take around 24-30 hours depending on the route and traffic conditions.
