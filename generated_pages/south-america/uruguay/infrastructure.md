[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Uruguay's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with investments in roads, energy, and telecommunications. The country's urban areas, such as the capital Montevideo, have a high level of infrastructure development, with access to modern amenities and services. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The government has been working to address this gap, with initiatives such as the expansion of rural electrification and the development of new water treatment plants.

Uruguay's infrastructure development has been driven by a combination of public and private investment. The government has invested heavily in infrastructure projects, such as the construction of new roads and the expansion of the country's port facilities. Private investment has also played a significant role, with companies investing in areas such as telecommunications and energy. The country's infrastructure development has been supported by international organizations, such as the Inter-American Development Bank, which has provided funding for a range of infrastructure projects.

Overall, Uruguay's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on providing access to basic services. However, there is still a need for ongoing investment and development, particularly in rural areas. The government and private sector are working together to address these challenges and ensure that all Uruguayan citizens have access to modern infrastructure and services.
