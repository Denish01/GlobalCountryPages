[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Uruguay has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. Citizens of over 70 countries, including the US, Canada, and most European countries, can enter Uruguay visa-free for tourism and business purposes. The country aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel for visitors, making it a popular destination in South America. Uruguay's visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to attract visitors and promote economic growth.

The visa policy is based on a system of reciprocity, where citizens of countries that offer visa-free access to Uruguayan citizens are also granted visa-free access to Uruguay. This approach has helped to simplify the visa process and make it easier for visitors to enter the country. Additionally, Uruguay offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, which cater to different types of visitors and their specific needs.
