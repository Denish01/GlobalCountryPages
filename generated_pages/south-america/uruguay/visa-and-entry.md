[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Uruguay has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of over 70 countries to enter the country without a visa for tourism or business purposes. These visa-free countries include many European nations, as well as the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Citizens of these countries can stay in Uruguay for up to 90 days without a visa, although they may be required to show proof of onward travel or sufficient funds. Uruguay's visa policy is designed to promote tourism and economic development, while also maintaining national security and immigration controls.

Uruguay's visa policy is relatively straightforward, with clear guidelines for tourists, business travelers, students, and workers. The country's immigration authority, the Dirección Nacional de Migración, is responsible for enforcing visa regulations and ensuring that all visitors comply with Uruguayan immigration laws. Visitors who plan to stay in Uruguay for more than 90 days or engage in activities other than tourism or business may need to apply for a different type of visa.
