  "content": "Uruguay's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on providing access to basic services such as electricity, water, and telecommunications to its population of 3.4 million people.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 75%\nRoad Network: 77,732 km, with 36% paved\nRail Network: 2,835 km\nMajor Airports: 9\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nUruguay's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with investments in roads, energy, and telecommunications. The country's urban areas, such as the capital Montevideo, have a high level of infrastructure development, with access to modern amenities and services. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water. The government has been working to address this gap, with initiatives such as the expansion of rural electrification and the development of new water treatment plants.\n\nUruguay's infrastructure development has been driven by a combination of public and private investment. The government has invested heavily in infrastructure projects, such as the construction of new roads and the expansion of the country's port facilities. Private investment has also played a significant role, with companies investing in areas such as telecommunications and energy. The country's infrastructure development has been supported by international organizations, such as the Inter-American Development Bank, which has provided funding for a range of infrastructure projects.\n\nOverall, Uruguay's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on providing access to basic services. However, there is still a need for ongoing investment and development, particularly in rural areas. The government and private sector are working together to address these challenges and ensure that all Uruguayan citizens have access to modern infrastructure and services.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 77,732 km | Good | 36% paved, with a focus on improving rural road networks |\n| Railways | 2,835 km | Moderate | Primarily used for freight transport, with some passenger services |\n| Airports | 9 international, 12 domestic | Good | Major airports include Carrasco International Airport and Punta del Este International Airport |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | Major ports include the Port of Montevideo and the Port of Nueva Palmira |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Uruguay's power generation is primarily based on **renewable energy sources**, with a focus on wind and hydroelectric power.\n- The country has a **reliable electricity supply**, with a low frequency of power outages.\n- Uruguay has made significant progress in recent years in increasing its use of **renewable energy**, with a target of generating 30% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\n- The country's energy sector is dominated by the state-owned company UTE, which is responsible for generating and distributing electricity.\n- Uruguay is also exploring the potential for **biomass energy**, with a number of biomass power plants currently under construction.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Uruguay has a **high level of access to clean water**, with 98% of the population having access to improved water sources.\n- The country's **sanitation coverage** is also high, with 95% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- However, there are still challenges in providing access to clean water and sanitation in **rural areas**, where many communities rely on wells and septic systems.\n- The government has implemented a number of initiatives to improve access to clean water and sanitation, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the expansion of rural water supply systems.\n- Uruguay has also made significant progress in reducing **water pollution**, with a focus on reducing the amount of wastewater discharged into the country's rivers and lakes.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Uruguay has a **high level of mobile penetration**, with over 150 mobile subscriptions per 100 people.\n- The country's **fiber-optic network** is also well-developed, with over 70% of the population having access to fiber-optic broadband.\n- Uruguay has been at the forefront of **4G and 5G rollout**, with a number of mobile operators offering high-speed mobile services.\n- The country's **postal services** are provided by the state-owned company Correo Uruguayo, which offers a range of services including mail delivery and parcel delivery.\n- Uruguay has also made significant progress in **bridging the digital divide**, with a number of initiatives aimed at increasing access to the internet and digital technologies in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government is currently implementing a **major road development program**, with a focus on improving rural road networks and reducing congestion in urban areas.\n- Uruguay is also investing in the development of its **port facilities**, with a number of projects aimed at increasing the capacity and efficiency of the country's ports.\n- The country is exploring the potential for **offshore wind energy**, with a number of companies currently conducting feasibility studies for offshore wind farms.\n- The government has also launched a **national broadband plan**, with a focus on increasing access to high-speed internet in rural areas.\n- Uruguay is also investing in the development of its **public transportation systems**, with a number of projects aimed at improving the efficiency and reliability of bus and rail services.",
