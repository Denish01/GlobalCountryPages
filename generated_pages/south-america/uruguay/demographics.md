[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Uruguay has a relatively small population compared to other countries in South America, but its population size has been steadily increasing over the years. The population growth rate is relatively low, at approximately 0.3% per annum, which is attributed to a combination of factors including a low fertility rate and an aging population. The country is highly urbanized, with over 93% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Montevideo. This has led to a significant rural-urban migration trend, with many young people moving to cities in search of better job opportunities and higher standards of living. The population is also aging, with a median age of 35.4 years, which has significant implications for the country's pension and healthcare systems.

The urbanization trend in Uruguay is driven by the country's economic and social development, with many people seeking better living conditions, education, and employment opportunities in urban areas. However, this has also led to challenges such as overcrowding, poverty, and inequality in urban areas. The government has implemented policies to address these issues, including investments in housing, transportation, and social services. Despite these challenges, Uruguay's population is known for its high level of education and social cohesion, with a strong emphasis on community and family ties.

Uruguay's population is also characterized by a high level of social mobility, with many people able to access education and job opportunities that were previously unavailable to them. This has led to a significant increase in the country's middle class, with many people enjoying a relatively high standard of living. However, there are still significant disparities in income and access to resources, particularly between urban and rural areas.
