[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Uruguay has a temperate climate, with four distinct seasons, each with its own characteristics and effects on travel. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal region, which has a more moderate climate, and the inland region, which has a more extreme climate. The dry season, from October to March, is the best time to visit Uruguay, with warm and sunny weather, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and beach trips. The wet season, from April to September, is characterized by cooler temperatures and more rainfall, making it less ideal for outdoor activities, but still a good time to visit the country's cities and cultural attractions.

The seasons in Uruguay also affect the crowds and prices, with the peak season, from December to February, being the busiest and most expensive time to visit. During this time, many Uruguayans take their summer vacations, and tourists from neighboring countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, flock to the country's beaches and resorts. The shoulder season, from April to June and September to November, is a good time to visit Uruguay, with fewer crowds and lower prices, making it ideal for budget-conscious travelers.

The seasons in Uruguay also have an impact on the country's festivals and events, with many taking place during the spring and summer months. The country's famous **Carnival** celebrations, for example, take place in February and March, while the **Uruguay Jazz Festival** takes place in September. Understanding the seasons and their effects on travel is essential to planning a trip to Uruguay and making the most of your time in the country.
