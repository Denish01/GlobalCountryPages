[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Uruguay is known for its high quality, with a strong emphasis on public education. The language of instruction is Spanish, and compulsory education lasts for 14 years, from preschool to the end of secondary school. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, and the quality of education is considered to be high. Private schools, on the other hand, offer an alternative for those who can afford it, with some institutions offering bilingual or international curricula. International schools are also available, mainly in the capital city of Montevideo, catering to the expat community and offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate.

The education system in Uruguay is divided into several stages, including preschool, primary school, secondary school, and higher education. The public education system is overseen by the Ministry of Education and Culture, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards and overseeing the administration of schools. Private schools, on the other hand, are regulated by the Ministry of Education and Culture, but have more autonomy in terms of curriculum and administration. International schools in Uruguay offer a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate, the British curriculum, and the American curriculum, among others.
