  "content": "Uruguay has a well-regarded healthcare system, with a strong public sector and good access to private healthcare options, making it an attractive destination for those seeking quality medical care in South America.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: [RATING] 4/5\nEmergency Number: 105\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nUruguay's healthcare system is based on a universal model, where all citizens have access to medical care, regardless of their income or social status. The public healthcare system is managed by the Ministry of Public Health, and it provides a wide range of services, including primary care, specialized care, and hospitalization. The public system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained professionals and modern equipment. However, there may be some waiting times for non-emergency procedures. In addition to the public system, there are also many private healthcare providers, including hospitals, clinics, and medical centers, which offer high-quality care and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe quality of care in Uruguay is generally good, with many medical professionals having received training in Europe or North America. Urban areas, such as Montevideo, tend to have better access to healthcare services and specialized care, while rural areas may have more limited options. However, the government has made efforts to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the establishment of community health centers and mobile health units.\n\nOverall, Uruguay's healthcare system is well-regarded, and it is considered to be one of the best in South America. The country has a high life expectancy, low infant mortality rates, and good control of infectious diseases. However, as with any healthcare system, there are some challenges, including long waiting times for non-emergency procedures and a shortage of certain medical specialties.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital de Clínicas | Montevideo | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Hospital Británico | Montevideo | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Hospital Italiano | Montevideo | Private | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Yes |\n| Hospital Español | Montevideo | Private | General medicine, surgery, neurology | Yes |\n| Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell | Montevideo | Public | Maternity, pediatrics, gynecology | Limited |\n| Sanatorio Americano | Montevideo | Private | General medicine, surgery, emergency medicine | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for those who want to have access to private healthcare services and shorter waiting times.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including plans offered by private insurance companies and mutual aid societies.\n- **Expats** can purchase private health insurance plans that cover them for medical care in Uruguay and other countries.\n- **Costs** of health insurance vary depending on the type of plan, age, and health status, but expect to pay around $500-1000 per month for a comprehensive plan.\n- **Social security** is available for Uruguayan citizens and residents, which provides access to public healthcare services.\n- **Supplemental insurance** is also available, which can provide additional coverage for services not included in the public system.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in pharmacies, including many international brands.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** include many international pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline.\n- **Costs** of medications are generally lower than in many other countries, with many generic options available.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies located throughout urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid fever, as well as routine vaccinations such as MMR and DTaP.\n- **Required vaccinations** include yellow fever for travelers coming from certain countries.\n- **Endemic diseases** include dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus, which are all mosquito-borne illnesses.\n- **Water safety** is generally good, with tap water being safe to drink in most areas.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, with many restaurants and food establishments following proper food handling and preparation procedures.\n- **Other health risks** include altitude sickness in the northern part of the country, as well as sun exposure and heat stroke during the summer months.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and dental care.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Hospital Británico and the Hospital Italiano, which have international accreditation and offer high-quality care.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many procedures costing 50-70% less than in the US or Europe.\n- **Tourist facilities** are available, including hotels and apartments, which can provide comfortable accommodations for patients and their families.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 105, which can be called from any phone.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with many private ambulance services available.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by calling the emergency number or by asking locals.\n- **Insurance claims** can be filed with private insurance companies, which can provide reimbursement for medical expenses.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, which can be arranged through private insurance companies or medical evacuation services.",
