[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Colombia offers a range of transportation options, including buses, taxis, ride-hailing services, and a metro system in major cities like Bogota and Medellin. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities generally having more comprehensive and efficient systems. Most people in Colombia get around using a combination of public transportation and walking, with many cities having pedestrian-friendly areas and bike paths. However, traffic congestion is a significant issue in many cities, particularly during rush hour, so it's essential to plan ahead and allow plenty of time for travel.

In addition to public transportation, many Colombians own cars, and the country has a well-developed road network. However, driving in Colombia can be challenging, especially for foreigners, due to the country's unique traffic laws and customs. For example, many cities have "pico y placa" restrictions, which limit the days and times that certain cars can be driven based on their license plate numbers. It's also common for roads to be closed or restricted due to protests, construction, or other events, so it's a good idea to stay informed about local conditions before heading out.
