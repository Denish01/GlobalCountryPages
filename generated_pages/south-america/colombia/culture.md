# Colombia Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Colombia's culture is a rich and diverse blend of indigenous, Spanish, and African influences. The country's unique cultural identity is shaped by its complex history, geography, and the interactions between different ethnic and linguistic groups. The majority of the population is of mixed European and indigenous descent, with a significant African influence in the coastal regions. The official language is Spanish, but there are over 60 indigenous languages spoken in the country, reflecting the diversity of the native communities.

The cultural identity of Colombia is also defined by its regional variations, with distinct customs, traditions, and dialects in different parts of the country. The Andean region, which includes the capital city of Bogota, is known for its conservative and traditional values, while the coastal regions are more laid-back and influenced by African and Caribbean rhythms. The country's cultural diversity is also reflected in its vibrant arts scene, with a mix of traditional and contemporary styles in music, dance, literature, and visual arts.

Colombia's cultural identity is deeply rooted in its history and traditions, with a strong emphasis on family, community, and social relationships. The country's cultural heritage is also influenced by its indigenous and African roots, with many traditional practices and customs still observed today. From the colorful textiles and handicrafts of the indigenous communities to the vibrant music and dance of the African-influenced coastal regions, Colombia's cultural diversity is a key aspect of its identity and a major draw for visitors.
