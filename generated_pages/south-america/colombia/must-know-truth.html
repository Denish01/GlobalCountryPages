        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Colombia has a rich and complex history that spans over 20,000 years, with the first human settlements dating back to the <strong>Pre-Ceramic Period</strong>. The Spanish colonization of Colombia began in the early 16th century, with the arrival of Spanish conquistador <strong>Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada</strong> in 1538. The Spanish established the <strong>New Kingdom of Granada</strong>, which included present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and parts of Brazil and Peru. Colombia declared its independence from Spain on July 20, 1810, and after a long and tumultuous process, it finally achieved independence in 1819 under the leadership of <strong>Simón Bolívar</strong>.</p>
        <p>The 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by periods of civil war, instability, and foreign intervention. Colombia became a <strong>sovereign state</strong> in 1886, with the adoption of a new constitution. The country experienced a period of rapid economic growth and modernization in the early 20th century, driven by the coffee and oil industries. However, this growth was accompanied by social and economic inequalities, which contributed to the country's ongoing struggles with poverty, inequality, and violence.</p>
        <p>Colombia's history has been shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of South America, with borders shared by <strong>Venezuela</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Peru</strong>, <strong>Ecuador</strong>, and <strong>Panama</strong>. The country's geography has played a significant role in its development, with the <strong>Andes Mountains</strong> dividing the country into distinct regions and the <strong>Amazon Rainforest</strong> covering a significant portion of its territory. Colombia's history has also been marked by the influence of <strong>indigenous cultures</strong>, <strong>African slavery</strong>, and <strong>European immigration</strong>, which have all contributed to the country's diverse cultural heritage.</p>
        <p>The country's recent history has been marked by a decades-long conflict between the government and <strong>left-wing guerrilla groups</strong>, including the <strong>Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)</strong> and the <strong>National Liberation Army (ELN)</strong>. This conflict has had a profound impact on Colombian society, resulting in significant human rights abuses, displacement, and economic costs. The Colombian government has made significant progress in recent years in addressing these challenges, including the signing of a <strong>peace agreement</strong> with the FARC in 2016.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Colombia is a war-torn country with no tourist infrastructure"</p>
        <p>Reality: While Colombia has faced significant security challenges in the past, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with many cities and towns now considered safe for tourists. Colombia has a well-developed tourist infrastructure, with many <strong>hostels</strong>, <strong>hotels</strong>, and <strong>tour operators</strong> catering to visitors. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Colombia is only known for coffee and cocaine"</p>
        <p>Reality: While coffee and cocaine are both significant industries in Colombia, the country has a diverse economy and a rich cultural heritage. Colombia is also known for its <strong>vibrant cities</strong>, <strong>beautiful beaches</strong>, <strong>snow-capped mountains</strong>, and <strong>lively festivals</strong>, such as the <strong>Carnival of Barranquilla</strong>. [/CALLOOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All Colombians are Spanish-speaking and Catholic"</p>
        <p>Reality: While the majority of Colombians are <strong>Spanish-speaking</strong> and <strong>Catholic</strong>, the country has a significant <strong>indigenous population</strong>, with over 80 distinct ethnic groups. Colombia also has a growing <strong>African Colombian</strong> population, and a significant <strong>Protestant</strong> minority. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Colombia is a poor and underdeveloped country"</p>
        <p>Reality: While Colombia still faces significant economic challenges, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing <strong>middle class</strong> and a <strong>diversified economy</strong>. Colombia is also home to a number of <strong>world-class universities</strong> and <strong>research institutions</strong>, and has a highly developed <strong>infrastructure</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Colombia is not a safe country for women"</p>
        <p>Reality: While Colombia has faced significant challenges related to <strong>gender-based violence</strong>, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing <strong>women's rights movement</strong> and a number of <strong>initiatives</strong> aimed at promoting <strong>gender equality</strong>. Many Colombian cities are considered safe for women, with a strong <strong>police presence</strong> and a <strong>thriving nightlife</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <h2>Challenges & Context</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Colombia faces significant challenges related to <strong>poverty and inequality</strong>, with over 27% of the population living below the poverty line.</li>
        <li>The country has a significant <strong>displacement crisis</strong>, with over 7 million people displaced due to conflict and violence.</li>
        <li>Colombia is also vulnerable to <strong>natural disasters</strong>, including earthquakes, floods, and landslides, due to its location in a <strong>seismically active region</strong>.</li>
        <li>The country has a significant <strong>deficit in its education system</strong>, with a lack of access to quality education in many rural areas.</li>
        <li>Colombia also faces challenges related to <strong>corruption and governance</strong>, with a number of high-profile corruption scandals in recent years.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Gets Overlooked</h2>
