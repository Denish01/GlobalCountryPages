  "content": "Colombia is generally cheaper than Peru, with an overall cost of living that is around 10-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nColombia GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,400\nPeru GDP per Capita (PPP): 13,400\nColombia Inflation Rate: 3.8%\nPeru Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Colombia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Colombia vs Peru [/SECTION]\nColombia and Peru are two countries in South America that offer a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. When it comes to the cost of living, both countries have their own strengths and weaknesses. Colombia has a more developed economy and a stronger currency, which can make some imported goods and services more expensive. However, the country also has a lower cost of living overall, with affordable housing, food, and transportation options. Peru, on the other hand, has a more tourist-oriented economy, which can drive up prices in popular areas like Lima and Cusco. Despite this, Peru still offers a relatively low cost of living, especially outside of the major cities.\n\nIn general, Colombia is around 10-20% cheaper than Peru, depending on the specific location and lifestyle. This is due in part to Colombia's larger economy and more developed infrastructure, which can make it easier to find affordable options for housing, food, and transportation. However, Peru has its own advantages, including a more stable currency and a lower cost of living in some areas. Overall, both countries offer a great value for expats, students, and retirees, but Colombia is generally the more affordable option.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Colombia (USD) | Peru (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 300 | 16.7% cheaper in Colombia |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 200 | 25% cheaper in Colombia |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 550 | 18.2% cheaper in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Colombia (USD) | Peru (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 6 | 16.7% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 200 | 250 | 20% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33.3% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Coffee | 1.50 | 2 | 25% cheaper in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Colombia (USD) | Peru (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 25 | 20% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.50 | 2 | 25% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1 | 20% cheaper in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Colombia (USD) | Peru (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 60 | 16.7% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 25 | 20% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33.3% cheaper in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Colombia (USD) | Peru (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 500 | 20% savings in Colombia |\n| Mid-Range | 700 | 900 | 22.2% savings in Colombia |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,500 | 20% savings in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Colombia is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 25% lower than in Peru\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices up to 16.7% lower than in Peru\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares up to 25% lower than in Peru\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices up to 20% lower than in Peru\n- **Peru is cheaper for:**\n  - Some tourist activities, such as visiting Machu.
