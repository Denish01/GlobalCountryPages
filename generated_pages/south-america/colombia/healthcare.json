The public system, known as the **Sistema Único de Salud (SUS)**, provides universal coverage to all citizens, while private providers offer additional options for those who can afford them. The quality of care in Colombia is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics meeting international standards, especially in urban areas like Bogota, Medellin, and Cali. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where resources and facilities may be scarce.\n\nThe Colombian government has made significant efforts to improve the healthcare system in recent years, increasing funding and implementing reforms to expand coverage and improve quality. As a result, Colombia has seen significant improvements in health outcomes, including a decline in infant mortality and an increase in life expectancy. Despite these advances, there are still challenges to be addressed, including disparities in access to care and the quality of services provided.\n\nIn terms of access, urban areas tend to have a higher concentration of healthcare providers and facilities, while rural areas may have limited options. However, the government has implemented programs to expand access to care in rural areas, including the use of **telemedicine** and mobile health units.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá | Bogota | Private | Cardiology, Oncology, Neurosurgery | Yes |\n| Clinica del Country | Bogota | Private | General Medicine, Pediatrics, Orthopedics | Yes |\n| Hospital Universitario San Ignacio | Bogota | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Care | Limited |\n| Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe | Medellin | Private | Cardiology, Oncology, Orthopedics | Yes |\n| Clinica Las Américas | Medellin | Private | General Medicine, Pediatrics, Gynecology | Yes |\n| Hospital General de Cali | Cali | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Care | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **International health insurance** is recommended for foreigners, as it provides coverage for emergency medical evacuations and repatriation.\n- **Local health insurance** options are available, including **SURA** and **Seguros del Estado**, which offer a range of plans for individuals and families.\n- **Expats** can purchase private health insurance plans, which often include coverage for dental and vision care.\n- **Costs** for health insurance vary depending on the provider and the level of coverage, but expect to pay between 500,000 and 2,000,000 COP per month.\n- **Group plans** are available for companies and organizations, which can provide discounted rates for employees.\n- **Private health insurance** plans often require a **deductible** and may have **co-payments** for certain services.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacies** are widespread in Colombia, with many locations open 24 hours a day.\n- **Prescription medications** are available at most pharmacies, but may require a prescription from a licensed physician.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including **Pfizer**, **GlaxoSmithKline**, and **Merck**.\n- **Costs** for medications vary depending on the type and brand, but expect to pay between 10,000 and 50,000 COP per prescription.\n- **Generic medications** are available at a lower cost than brand-name medications.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever vaccination** is required for travel to certain areas of Colombia, including the departments of Amazonas, Arauca, and Guainía.\n- **Hepatitis A and B vaccinations** are recommended for all travelers to Colombia.\n- **Typhoid vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Colombia, including the departments of Chocó and Nariño.\n- **Dengue fever** is present in some areas of Colombia, including the departments of Antioquia and Caldas.\n- **Zika virus** is present in some areas of Colombia, including the departments of Atlántico and Bolívar.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Cosmetic surgery** is a popular procedure for medical tourists in Colombia, with many clinics offering services such as **breast augmentation** and **rhinoplasty**.\n- **Dental care** is also a popular service for medical tourists, with many clinics offering **dental implants** and **orthodontic care**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the **Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá** and the **Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe**.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists, with prices often 50-75% lower than in the US or Europe.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, call 123 or go to the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** varies depending on the location, but many private hospitals and clinics have their own ambulance services.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by searching online or asking locals for directions.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed as soon as possible after an emergency, with all necessary documentation and receipts.\n- **Emergency care** is generally available at public and private hospitals, including **trauma care** and **emergency surgery**.",
