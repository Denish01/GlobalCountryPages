[SECTION] Overview: Colombia vs Ecuador [/SECTION]
Colombia and Ecuador are two neighboring countries in South America that offer a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, Colombia is generally cheaper than Ecuador, with a difference of around 10-20% in favor of Colombia. This is largely due to the fact that Colombia has a more developed economy and a larger population, which has led to increased competition and lower prices in many sectors. Additionally, Colombia has a more favorable exchange rate, which makes it easier for foreigners to afford goods and services.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Colombia has a more diversified economy, with a strong service sector and a growing manufacturing industry, which has led to increased economic growth and stability. Ecuador, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a strong dependence on oil exports, which has made it more vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. As a result, Colombia is generally considered a more affordable and stable destination for expats, students, and retirees.
