  "content": "The official language spoken in Colombia is Spanish, and it is the primary language used for communication in the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Spanish\nWidely Spoken: English, particularly in tourist areas and among businesspeople\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Colombia is dominated by Spanish, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. There are several regional dialects, including the **Andean dialect** spoken in the central highlands, the **Costeño dialect** spoken along the Caribbean coast, and the **Llanero dialect** spoken in the eastern plains. These dialects can vary significantly from one another, with distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammatical structures. In addition to Spanish, there are over 60 **indigenous languages** spoken in Colombia, including Wayúu, Paez, and Quechua, which are spoken by the country's various indigenous communities. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of major cities and tourist areas, so visitors who speak some Spanish will have a much easier time communicating and navigating the country.\n\nWhile Spanish is the dominant language, English is becoming more widely spoken, particularly among younger people and those in the service industry. However, English proficiency is still relatively low, and visitors should not assume that everyone they meet will speak English. In fact, many Colombians are eager to practice their English skills, so visitors who make an effort to speak Spanish may find that locals are more willing to engage with them in English. In addition to Spanish and English, there are also several **Creole languages** spoken in Colombia, including San Andrés-Providencia Creole, which is spoken on the islands of San Andrés and Providencia.\n\nColombia's linguistic diversity is also reflected in its **sign language**, which is used by the country's deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. While sign language is not widely used, it is an important part of Colombian culture and is recognized as an official language. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Colombia is complex and diverse, with a range of languages and dialects spoken across the country. Visitors who take the time to learn some basic Spanish phrases will find that it enhances their travel experience and allows them to connect more deeply with the people and culture of Colombia.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola | OH-lah | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Gracias | GRAH-see-ahs |  |\n| Please | Por favor | paw-FAH-vor |  |\n| Yes / No | Sí / No | SEE / noh |  |\n| Excuse me | Con permiso | kohn pehr-MEE-soh |  |\n| How much? | Cuánto cuesta | KWAHN-toh KWEHS-tah |  |\n| Where is...? | Dónde está... | DOHN-deh EH-stah |  |\n| I don't understand | No entiendo | noh ehn-tee-EHN-doh |  |\n| Do you speak English? | ¿Habla inglés? | AHB-lah eeng-lee-EHZ |  |\n| Help! | ¡Ayuda! | ah-YOO-dah |  |\n| Goodbye | Adiós | ah-DEE-yos | formal |\n| Sorry | Lo siento | loh see-en-toh |  |\n| How are you? | ¿Cómo estás? | KOH-moh eh-STAH | informal |\n| What's your name? | ¿Cómo te llamas? | KOH-moh teh YAH-mahs |  |\n| I'm from... | Soy de... | SOH-ee deh |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Uno | oo-noh |\n| 2 | Dos | dohs |\n| 3 | Tres | trays |\n| 4 | Cuatro | kwah-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | SIHN-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | says |\n| 7 | Siete | see-EH-teh |\n| 8 | Ocho | OH-choh |\n| 9 | Nueve | nwEH-vay |\n| 10 | Diez | dee-EHZ |\n| 100 | Cien | see-EHN |\n| 1000 | Mil | meel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be prepared to use **hand gestures** and **body language** to communicate, as many Colombians are expressive and use nonverbal cues to convey meaning.\n- Avoid using **informal language** or slang, as it may be perceived as disrespectful or unprofessional.\n- Use **formal titles** such as \"señor\" or \"señora\" when addressing older people or those in positions of authority.\n- Be patient and **don't get frustrated** if you don't understand something - Colombians are generally friendly and willing to help.\n- Use **visual aids** such as maps or pictures to help communicate, especially when discussing directions or locations.\n- Avoid **talking loudly** or using loud gestures, as this may be seen as rude or aggressive.\n- Be **respectful of cultural differences** and traditions, and try to learn about Colombian customs and norms.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a **translation app** such as Google Translate or iTranslate to help with communication.\n- Carry a **phrasebook** or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a **language course** or use online resources to learn basic Spanish before traveling to Colombia.\n- Use **online translation tools** such as language exchange websites or forums to connect with native speakers and get language help.\n- Consider hiring a **local guide** or translator to help with communication and navigation, especially in rural areas or when dealing with complex situations.",
