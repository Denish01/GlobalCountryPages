  "content": "The population of Colombia is approximately 52 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that reflect the country's rich cultural heritage. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: (52.0 million)\nPopulation Growth Rate: (0.9%)\nMedian Age: (30.4 years)\nUrban Population: (76.4%)\nPopulation Density: (46 per km2)\nLife Expectancy: (77.1 years)\nFertility Rate: (1.8 children per woman)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nColombia has a large and growing population, with the majority of its citizens residing in urban areas. The country's population size is significant in the context of South America, with Colombia being the third-most populous country in the region. The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the past few decades, from 1.4% in 2000 to 0.9% in 2020. This decline can be attributed to a decrease in fertility rates and an increase in urbanization. Colombia's urban population is approximately 76.4%, with many citizens migrating from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe country's population is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 30.4 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large youth population can contribute to a vibrant workforce and drive economic growth. However, it also poses challenges in terms of providing adequate education, healthcare, and employment opportunities for young people. Colombia's population density is approximately 46 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high compared to other countries in South America.\n\nColombia's population has been shaped by various migration patterns throughout its history. The country has experienced significant internal migration, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Additionally, Colombia has also been a destination for refugees and migrants from neighboring countries, particularly Venezuela. This has put a strain on the country's resources and infrastructure, but has also contributed to the country's cultural diversity.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mestizo | 58% | Nationwide | Mixed European and indigenous ancestry |\n| European | 20% | Urban areas | Primarily of Spanish, Italian, and German descent |\n| Afro-Colombian | 10% | Coastal regions | Descendants of African slaves |\n| Indigenous | 3% | Rural areas | Over 80 distinct indigenous groups |\n| Raizal | 1% | San Andres and Providencia | English-speaking, Afro-Caribbean community |\n| Palenquero | 0.2% | San Basilio de Palenque | Creole-speaking, Afro-Colombian community |\n[/TABLE]\nColombia is a culturally diverse country, with a mix of ethnic groups that reflect the country's complex history.
