[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Colombia is a country with a diverse geography, spanning from the **Andes Mountains** to the **Amazon rainforest** and the **Caribbean coast**. The country's climate varies greatly depending on the region, with different areas experiencing different dry and wet seasons. The dry season, which typically runs from December to March, is characterized by clear skies, warm temperatures, and low humidity, making it the best time to visit Colombia. The wet season, which runs from April to November, is marked by heavy rainfall, flooding, and higher temperatures, making it a less desirable time to visit.

The seasons in Colombia are influenced by the country's geography, with the **Andes Mountains** creating a range of microclimates. The highlands, including the capital city **Bogota**, have a cool and dry climate year-round, while the low-lying areas, such as the **Caribbean coast**, are hot and humid. The **Amazon rainforest**, which covers a significant portion of the country, has a tropical climate with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year.

The seasons in Colombia can greatly affect travel plans, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's many **national parks**, **hiking trails**, and **beaches**. The wet season, on the other hand, can make it difficult to access certain areas, especially in the **Amazon rainforest**, where flooding can be severe. However, the wet season can also be a great time to visit Colombia's many **cities**, which are less crowded and offer a more relaxed atmosphere.
