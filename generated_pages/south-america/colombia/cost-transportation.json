The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities generally having more comprehensive and efficient systems. Most people in Colombia get around using a combination of public transportation and walking, with many cities having pedestrian-friendly areas and bike paths. However, traffic congestion is a significant issue in many cities, particularly during rush hour, so it's essential to plan ahead and allow plenty of time for travel.\n\nIn addition to public transportation, many Colombians own cars, and the country has a well-developed road network. However, driving in Colombia can be challenging, especially for foreigners, due to the country's unique traffic laws and customs. For example, many cities have \"pico y placa\" restrictions, which limit the days and times that certain cars can be driven based on their license plate numbers. It's also common for roads to be closed or restricted due to protests, construction, or other events, so it's a good idea to stay informed about local conditions before heading out.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Good coverage in major cities, less frequent in rural areas |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.60-$1.20 | $25-$40 | Available in Bogota, Medellin, and Cali, with expansion plans in other cities |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Common in smaller cities and rural areas, often with fixed routes |\n| Commuter Train | $1.50-$3.00 | $30-$50 | Limited availability, mainly in Bogota and surrounding areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.25 | $5-$10 | Available in most cities, but be sure to use a licensed taxi |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.30 | $5-$15 | Uber and Cabify are widely available, with competitive pricing |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$30 | Private transfers and shuttles available, often with fixed rates |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.70 | Prices vary depending on location and type of fuel |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.60 | Commonly used for buses and trucks |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-$60 | Economy cars available, with discounts for longer rentals |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$3 | Prices vary depending on location and time of day |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Some highways and roads have tolls, often with cash or card payment options |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | Comfortable and affordable, with frequent departures |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$150 | Faster but more expensive, with multiple daily flights between major cities |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited availability, mainly for tourist routes like the Coffee Region |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Research your transportation options in advance to find the best deals and most convenient routes.\n- Consider purchasing a rechargeable **Civica** card for public transportation in major cities, which can save you money and time.\n- Always use licensed taxis or ride-hailing services, and be sure to check the fare before you start your journey.\n- Be prepared for traffic congestion and potential delays, especially during peak hours or in areas with roadwork.\n- If you plan to drive, make sure you have a valid driver's license and are familiar with local traffic laws and customs.\n- Download transportation apps like **Moovit** or **Waze** to help navigate the city and find the best routes.",
