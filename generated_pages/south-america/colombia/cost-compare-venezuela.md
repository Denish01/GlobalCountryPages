[SECTION] Overview: Colombia vs Venezuela [/SECTION]
Colombia and Venezuela are two neighboring countries in South America with distinct economic contexts. Colombia has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, driven by a thriving services sector, a growing middle class, and a relatively stable government. In contrast, Venezuela has faced severe economic challenges, including hyperinflation, a decline in oil production, and a humanitarian crisis. As a result, the cost of living in Colombia is generally lower than in Venezuela, with prices for goods and services around 20-30% lower. This is due in part to Colombia's more stable economy and its ability to maintain a relatively low inflation rate.

The economic context of the two countries has a significant impact on the cost of living. In Colombia, the government has implemented policies to promote economic growth and stability, such as investing in infrastructure and education. In contrast, Venezuela's economic crisis has led to a shortage of basic goods and services, resulting in higher prices and a lower quality of life. For example, the price of a meal at a restaurant in Colombia is around $3-5, while in Venezuela it can cost $10-20. Similarly, the cost of a 1-bedroom apartment in the city center in Colombia is around $200-300 per month, while in Venezuela it can cost $500-1000 per month.
