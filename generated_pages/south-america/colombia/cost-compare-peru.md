[SECTION] Overview: Colombia vs Peru [/SECTION]
Colombia and Peru are two countries in South America that offer a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. When it comes to the cost of living, both countries have their own strengths and weaknesses. Colombia has a more developed economy and a stronger currency, which can make some imported goods and services more expensive. However, the country also has a lower cost of living overall, with affordable housing, food, and transportation options. Peru, on the other hand, has a more tourist-oriented economy, which can drive up prices in popular areas like Lima and Cusco. Despite this, Peru still offers a relatively low cost of living, especially outside of the major cities.

In general, Colombia is around 10-20% cheaper than Peru, depending on the specific location and lifestyle. This is due in part to Colombia's larger economy and more developed infrastructure, which can make it easier to find affordable options for housing, food, and transportation. However, Peru has its own advantages, including a more stable currency and a lower cost of living in some areas. Overall, both countries offer a great value for expats, students, and retirees, but Colombia is generally the more affordable option.
