[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Colombia's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers to offer a range of healthcare services to its citizens and foreigners. The public system, known as the **Sistema Único de Salud (SUS)**, is generally more affordable and accessible to locals, while private healthcare providers offer higher-quality services, often with bilingual staff and more modern facilities, catering to foreigners and affluent Colombians. The public system is funded through a combination of government subsidies and individual contributions, while private healthcare is typically paid out-of-pocket or through private insurance. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance to access quality healthcare, as the public system may have limitations and waiting times.

The Colombian healthcare system is generally well-regarded, with many qualified medical professionals and modern facilities, particularly in major cities like Bogota and Medellin. However, there can be significant disparities in the quality of care between public and private providers, as well as between urban and rural areas. For example, public hospitals in rural areas may have limited resources and outdated equipment, while private clinics in major cities may offer state-of-the-art facilities and specialized care. As a result, foreigners and affluent Colombians often opt for private healthcare, which can be more expensive but offers higher-quality services and shorter waiting times.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 123, or visit the nearest hospital or clinic. Ambulance services are widely available, but may not always be equipped with advanced life-support equipment. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including the embassy and insurance provider, in case of an emergency. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Colombia include the **Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá** and the **Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe** in Medellin, which offer high-quality care and bilingual staff.

When seeking emergency care, it is crucial to have a basic understanding of Spanish, as not all medical staff may speak English. Additionally, it is recommended to have a copy of your insurance documents and identification with you at all times, in case of an emergency. Many hospitals and clinics also offer 24/7 emergency services, including **Clínica del Country** in Bogota, which has a dedicated emergency room and offers advanced medical care. By being prepared and knowing where to go in case of an emergency, foreigners can receive quality medical care and stay safe while traveling in Colombia.
