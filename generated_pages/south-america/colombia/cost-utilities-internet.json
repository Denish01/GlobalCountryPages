However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the region, with cities like Bogota and Medellin tend to have higher costs than smaller towns. The country's inflation rate of 6.6% in 2024 can also impact the cost of utilities, leading to occasional price increases. Seasonal variation can also affect utility costs, with higher electricity bills during the dry season (December to March) due to increased energy consumption.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Colombia is generally good, with most providers offering reliable and efficient services. However, some areas may experience occasional power outages or water shortages, especially during periods of heavy rainfall or maintenance work. It's essential to research and compare prices among different providers to find the best deals and plans that suit your needs and budget. Additionally, some providers offer discounts or promotions for new customers, so it's worth shopping around to find the best option.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $40 | $60 | $80 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$65** | **$100** | **$135** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-25 | 10-20 Mbps | Claro, Movistar |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-50 | 50-100 Mbps | Claro, Movistar |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Claro, Movistar, Tigo |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10-20 GB | Claro, Movistar, Tigo |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $40-60 | varies | Claro, Movistar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's recommended to contact the provider directly or visit their website to schedule an appointment and provide necessary documents, such as a valid ID and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for those who want to control their energy consumption and avoid surprise bills, but postpaid plans may offer more flexible payment options and discounts for long-term contracts.\n- Claro and Movistar are two of the most popular internet providers in Colombia, offering reliable and fast services, but it's essential to research and compare prices and plans before choosing a provider.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and taking advantage of discounts or promotions offered by providers.\n- It's also a good idea to monitor your energy consumption and adjust your usage habits accordingly to avoid surprise bills and reduce your environmental impact.",
