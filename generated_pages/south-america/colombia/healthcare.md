[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Colombia's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining public and private providers to offer a wide range of services to its citizens and visitors. The public system, known as the **Sistema Único de Salud (SUS)**, provides universal coverage to all citizens, while private providers offer additional options for those who can afford them. The quality of care in Colombia is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics meeting international standards, especially in urban areas like Bogota, Medellin, and Cali. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where resources and facilities may be scarce.

The Colombian government has made significant efforts to improve the healthcare system in recent years, increasing funding and implementing reforms to expand coverage and improve quality. As a result, Colombia has seen significant improvements in health outcomes, including a decline in infant mortality and an increase in life expectancy. Despite these advances, there are still challenges to be addressed, including disparities in access to care and the quality of services provided.

In terms of access, urban areas tend to have a higher concentration of healthcare providers and facilities, while rural areas may have limited options. However, the government has implemented programs to expand access to care in rural areas, including the use of **telemedicine** and mobile health units.
