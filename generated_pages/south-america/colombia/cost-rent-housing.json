Typical lease terms in Colombia are for 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one or two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with renters having the right to a written contract, a safe and habitable living space, and protection from unfair eviction. Compared to its regional neighbors, Colombia's housing costs are generally lower, making it an attractive option for expats and foreigners. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Bogota and Medellin tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe Colombian housing market is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 6.6% and GDP per capita of $22,349 affecting the affordability of housing. Additionally, the government's investment in education and healthcare, with 5.3% of GDP spent on education and $644 per capita spent on healthcare, has contributed to an overall improvement in the standard of living, making Colombia an attractive option for those looking to relocate. The out-of-pocket health spend of 14.7% also indicates that there may be additional costs associated with healthcare that renters should consider.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $180-300 | $120-250 | small, basic apartments |\n| 1 Bedroom | $250-400 | $200-350 | typical quality, furnished or unfurnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $350-550 | $280-450 | family size, may include amenities like pool or gym |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-700 | $400-600 | spacious, may include additional features like balcony or parking |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-2,500 | prime locations, high-demand areas |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-2,000 | residential areas, may include amenities like parks or shopping centers |\n| Rural | $500-1,000 | rural areas, may require additional investment for infrastructure and services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **La Macarena** in Bogota: a trendy, upscale neighborhood with a range of restaurants and bars, rent range $250-400 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **El Poblado** in Medellin: a popular neighborhood for expats, with a range of amenities and services, rent range $200-350 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Usaquen** in Bogota: a charming, historic neighborhood with a range of shops and restaurants, rent range $200-350 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Envigado** in Medellin: a family-friendly neighborhood with a range of parks and outdoor spaces, rent range $180-300 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n- **Chapinero** in Bogota: a vibrant, eclectic neighborhood with a range of cultural attractions, rent range $250-400 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Colombia [/SECTION]\n- Research different neighborhoods and areas to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a reliable and affordable rental property\n- Be sure to inspect the property carefully before signing a lease, and negotiate the terms of the contract if necessary\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment, as this can be a more convenient and cost-effective option\n- Be aware of scams and fraudulent rental listings, and always verify the identity and credentials of the landlord or property manager\n- Utilities such as water, electricity, and gas are usually not included in the rent, so be sure to factor these costs into your budget",
