[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Colombia is dominated by Spanish, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. There are several regional dialects, including the **Andean dialect** spoken in the central highlands, the **Costeño dialect** spoken along the Caribbean coast, and the **Llanero dialect** spoken in the eastern plains. These dialects can vary significantly from one another, with distinct accents, vocabulary, and grammatical structures. In addition to Spanish, there are over 60 **indigenous languages** spoken in Colombia, including Wayúu, Paez, and Quechua, which are spoken by the country's various indigenous communities. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of major cities and tourist areas, so visitors who speak some Spanish will have a much easier time communicating and navigating the country.

While Spanish is the dominant language, English is becoming more widely spoken, particularly among younger people and those in the service industry. However, English proficiency is still relatively low, and visitors should not assume that everyone they meet will speak English. In fact, many Colombians are eager to practice their English skills, so visitors who make an effort to speak Spanish may find that locals are more willing to engage with them in English. In addition to Spanish and English, there are also several **Creole languages** spoken in Colombia, including San Andrés-Providencia Creole, which is spoken on the islands of San Andrés and Providencia.

Colombia's linguistic diversity is also reflected in its **sign language**, which is used by the country's deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. While sign language is not widely used, it is an important part of Colombian culture and is recognized as an official language. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Colombia is complex and diverse, with a range of languages and dialects spoken across the country. Visitors who take the time to learn some basic Spanish phrases will find that it enhances their travel experience and allows them to connect more deeply with the people and culture of Colombia.
