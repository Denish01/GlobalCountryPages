[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Colombia is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Typical lease terms in Colombia are for 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one or two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with renters having the right to a written contract, a safe and habitable living space, and protection from unfair eviction. Compared to its regional neighbors, Colombia's housing costs are generally lower, making it an attractive option for expats and foreigners. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Bogota and Medellin tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.

The Colombian housing market is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 6.6% and GDP per capita of $22,349 affecting the affordability of housing. Additionally, the government's investment in education and healthcare, with 5.3% of GDP spent on education and $644 per capita spent on healthcare, has contributed to an overall improvement in the standard of living, making Colombia an attractive option for those looking to relocate. The out-of-pocket health spend of 14.7% also indicates that there may be additional costs associated with healthcare that renters should consider.
