  "content": "Colombia's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with improvements in roads, energy, and telecommunications, although gaps remain between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 97.2% of population\nInternet Penetration: 58.1%\nRoad Network: 114,000 km, with 25% paved\nRail Network: 1,700 km\nMajor Airports: 11\nMajor Ports: 5\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nColombia's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a mix of modern and outdated systems. Recent investments have focused on upgrading roads, expanding energy generation, and improving telecommunications. However, a significant gap remains between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services like electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including programs to expand rural electrification and improve water supply systems.\n\nDespite these efforts, challenges persist, particularly in areas affected by conflict and poverty. The country's geography also poses significant infrastructure challenges, with mountainous terrain and dense rainforests making it difficult to build and maintain roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. Nevertheless, Colombia has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in infrastructure reaching record levels.\n\nThe government's focus on infrastructure development is expected to continue, with a emphasis on sustainable and environmentally-friendly projects. This includes initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and industries. Additionally, the government is investing in transportation infrastructure, including the expansion of airports, seaports, and highways, to facilitate trade and economic growth.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 114,000 km | Moderate | 25% paved, with many rural roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 1,700 km | Poor | Limited passenger services, mostly used for freight |\n| Airports | 11 international, 20 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, with some airports undergoing expansion |\n| Ports | 5 major | Moderate | Some ports have limited capacity and outdated facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Colombia's power generation mix is dominated by **hydroelectric power**, which accounts for over 60% of total electricity generation.\n- The country has made significant progress in expanding energy access, with over 97% of the population now having access to electricity.\n- However, **power outages** remain a problem, particularly in rural areas, where the grid is often unreliable and prone to disruptions.\n- Colombia has set ambitious targets to increase the share of **renewable energy** in its energy mix, including wind, solar, and geothermal power.\n- The government has implemented policies to promote energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, including incentives for the use of **energy-efficient appliances** and **green building** practices.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in some areas, particularly in rural communities where water treatment facilities may be inadequate or non-existent.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with over 80% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- However, **water access** remains a challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on wells, rivers, or other untreated water sources.\n- The government has implemented programs to improve water supply systems, including the construction of new water treatment plants and distribution networks.\n- **Wastewater treatment** is also a priority, with efforts to increase the percentage of wastewater that is treated before being released into the environment.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in many urban areas, although rural communities often have limited access to high-speed internet.\n- The rollout of **4G and 5G networks** is ongoing, with several major operators already offering these services in select areas.\n- **Postal services** are provided by the state-owned operator, although the use of postal services is declining with the increasing popularity of digital communication.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to promote **digital inclusion**, including programs to provide low-cost internet access and digital literacy training to disadvantaged communities.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major **transportation infrastructure program**, which includes the construction of new highways, bridges, and airports.\n- A **renewable energy development plan** is underway, which aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n- The **Bogota metro expansion** project is a major urban development initiative, which will increase the city's metro network and improve public transportation.\n- The government has also launched a **rural electrification program**, which aims to provide electricity to over 100,000 rural households by 2025.\n- A **water supply and sanitation project** is being implemented in several major cities, which will improve water treatment and distribution systems and increase access to sanitation facilities.",
