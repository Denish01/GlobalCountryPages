  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nColombia has a rich and complex history that spans over 20,000 years, with the first human settlements dating back to the **Pre-Ceramic Period**. The Spanish colonization of Colombia began in the early 16th century, with the arrival of Spanish conquistador **Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada** in 1538. The Spanish established the **New Kingdom of Granada**, which included present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and parts of Brazil and Peru. Colombia declared its independence from Spain on July 20, 1810, and after a long and tumultuous process, it finally achieved independence in 1819 under the leadership of **Simón Bolívar**.\n\nThe 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by periods of civil war, instability, and foreign intervention. Colombia became a **sovereign state** in 1886, with the adoption of a new constitution.

However, this growth was accompanied by social and economic inequalities, which contributed to the country's ongoing struggles with poverty, inequality, and violence.\n\nColombia's history has been shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of South America, with borders shared by **Venezuela**, **Brazil**, **Peru**, **Ecuador**, and **Panama**.
