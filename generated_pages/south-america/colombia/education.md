[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Colombia is divided into three main levels: **primary education**, which lasts for 5 years, **secondary education**, which lasts for 6 years, and **tertiary education**, which includes university and technical programs. The system is overseen by the Ministry of National Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, funding, and oversight. The quality of education in Colombia varies, with public schools often facing challenges such as limited resources and overcrowding, while private schools tend to offer higher-quality education and better facilities. Despite these challenges, Colombia has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with a literacy rate of over 95%.

The structure of the education system in Colombia is designed to provide students with a comprehensive education that prepares them for higher education or the workforce. The curriculum includes a range of subjects, such as mathematics, science, language, and social studies, as well as physical education and arts. Public education is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 18, although some private schools may offer alternative curricula and programs. The Colombian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including teacher training programs, infrastructure development, and partnerships with private organizations.

In recent years, Colombia has seen a significant increase in enrollment rates, particularly at the tertiary level, with many students pursuing degrees in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine. However, the system still faces challenges, such as inadequate funding, limited access to education in rural areas, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, Colombia is committed to improving its education system and providing its citizens with the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the global economy.
