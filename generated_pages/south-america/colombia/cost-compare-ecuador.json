  "content": "Colombia is generally cheaper than Ecuador, with an overall cost of living difference of around 10-20% in favor of Colombia.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nColombia GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,400\nEcuador GDP per Capita (PPP): 11,300\nColombia Inflation Rate: 3.2%\nEcuador Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Colombia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Colombia vs Ecuador [/SECTION]\nColombia and Ecuador are two neighboring countries in South America that offer a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, Colombia is generally cheaper than Ecuador, with a difference of around 10-20% in favor of Colombia. This is largely due to the fact that Colombia has a more developed economy and a larger population, which has led to increased competition and lower prices in many sectors. Additionally, Colombia has a more favorable exchange rate, which makes it easier for foreigners to afford goods and services.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Colombia has a more diversified economy, with a strong service sector and a growing manufacturing industry, which has led to increased economic growth and stability. Ecuador, on the other hand, has a more limited economy, with a strong dependence on oil exports, which has made it more vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. As a result, Colombia is generally considered a more affordable and stable destination for expats, students, and retirees.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Colombia (USD) | Ecuador (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 350 | 29% cheaper in Colombia |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 180 | 250 | 28% cheaper in Colombia |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 600 | 25% cheaper in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Colombia (USD) | Ecuador (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 7 | 29% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 400 | 25% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Coffee | 1.5 | 2.5 | 40% cheaper in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Colombia (USD) | Ecuador (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.5 | 2.5 | 40% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% cheaper in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Colombia (USD) | Ecuador (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 80 | 120 | 33% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% cheaper in Colombia |\n| Mobile Plan | 15 | 25 | 40% cheaper in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Colombia (USD) | Ecuador (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 600 | 800 | 25% savings in Colombia |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 1,600 | 25% savings in Colombia |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 2,600 | 23% savings in Colombia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Colombia is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 30% lower than in Ecuador\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices up to 40% lower than in Ecuador\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices up to 40% lower than in Ecuador\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices up to 40% lower than in Ecuador\n- **Ecuador is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain types of groceries, such as fresh produce and meat\n  - Some tourist activities, such as visiting national parks and museums\n  - Certain types of accommodation, such as hostels and guesthouses\n  - Some types of healthcare services, such as medical consultations and prescriptions\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nColombia and Ecuador are both great destinations for expats, students, and retirees, but they offer different advantages and disadvantages.
