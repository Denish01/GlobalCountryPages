[SECTION] How Colombia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Colombia is a sovereign country divided into 32 departments, which are further divided into municipalities. Each department has its own capital and is governed by a governor and a departmental assembly. The country also has four main geographical regions: the Andean region, the Caribbean region, the Pacific region, and the Amazon region. These regions are not administrative divisions but rather geographical and cultural areas that define the country's diversity.

The administrative structure of Colombia is designed to provide a balance of power between the central government and the departments. The central government is responsible for national policies, while the departments have a degree of autonomy to manage their local affairs. This structure allows for a more efficient distribution of resources and a better representation of the country's diverse regions.
