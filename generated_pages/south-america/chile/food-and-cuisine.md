[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Chile's cuisine is defined by its geographic location, with the Andes Mountains to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Atacama Desert to the north. This unique geography has created a diverse range of regional specialties, from the seafood-rich dishes of the coastal regions to the hearty meat stews of the Andean highlands. The indigenous **Mapuche** people have also had a significant influence on Chilean cuisine, introducing crops such as corn, potatoes, and beans. Additionally, Spanish and Italian immigrants have contributed to the development of Chilean cuisine, introducing new ingredients and cooking techniques.

Chilean cuisine is known for its bold flavors and hearty portions, with a focus on locally sourced ingredients. The country's long coastline provides an abundance of fresh seafood, which is often used in dishes such as **Chupe de Mariscos**, a rich seafood stew. The Andean highlands are home to a variety of **papas**, or potatoes, which are often used in dishes such as **Cazuela**, a hearty beef stew. The central region of Chile is known for its **vino**, or wine, which is often paired with meals.

The regional variations in Chilean cuisine are also worth noting. The northern region of Chile is known for its **Ch'arki**, a type of dried beef, while the southern region is famous for its **Cordero al Palo**, a whole roasted lamb. The Easter Island, a Chilean territory in the Pacific Ocean, has a unique cuisine that reflects its Polynesian heritage, with dishes such as **Tunah**, a raw fish dish marinated in coconut milk.
