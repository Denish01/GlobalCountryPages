[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Chile is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **Enseñanza Básica**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 14 and consists of eight years of schooling. Secondary education, or **Enseñanza Media**, is also compulsory and lasts for four years, typically from ages 15 to 18. Tertiary education, or **Educación Superior**, includes universities, professional institutes, and technical training centers, offering a wide range of academic programs, including bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. The quality of education in Chile is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.

The education system in Chile is a mix of public and private institutions, with a significant number of private schools and universities that offer high-quality education, often with a focus on **internationalization** and **bilingualism**. Public education, on the other hand, is free and accessible to all citizens, but often faces challenges related to funding and resources. Despite these challenges, Chile has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly for disadvantaged groups, and has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, such as the **National Education Strategy**.

Chile's education system has undergone significant reforms in recent years, aimed at improving the quality and equity of education, particularly for vulnerable populations. These reforms have included the introduction of **full-day schooling**, the expansion of **early childhood education**, and the implementation of **new teacher evaluation and training programs**. While these reforms have shown promise, the education system in Chile still faces challenges related to **inequality** and **access**, particularly in rural and disadvantaged areas.
