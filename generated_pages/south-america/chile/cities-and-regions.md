[SECTION] How Chile Is Divided [/SECTION]
Chile is a unitary presidential republic divided into 16 regions, each with its own capital and a certain degree of autonomy. These regions are further divided into provinces, which are then divided into communes. The regions are the primary administrative divisions, and each has its own governor and regional council. This structure allows for a balance between centralized governance and regional autonomy, enabling the country to address local needs while maintaining national cohesion.

The 16 regions of Chile are diverse, ranging from the arid Atacama Desert in the north to the rugged and icy landscapes of Patagonia in the south. Each region has its unique character, shaped by its geography, climate, and cultural heritage. The regional capitals serve as hubs for economic, cultural, and administrative activities, while the provinces and communes provide more localized governance and services.
