However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months (June to August) due to increased demand for heating. The overall quality of the utility infrastructure is good, with minimal disruptions to services. The costs of utilities in Chile are generally stable, but can be affected by inflation, which was 4.3% in 2024.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Chile can also vary depending on the region, with the central region, where the capital Santiago is located, tend to have higher costs than other regions. Additionally, the cost of utilities can also depend on the type of accommodation, with apartments in urban areas tend to have higher costs than houses in rural areas. It's worth noting that the Chilean government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, such as subsidies for low-income households.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$140** | **$215** | **$310** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Movistar, Entel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 50-100 Mbps | Movistar, Entel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Movistar, Entel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10-20 GB | Movistar, Entel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Movistar, Entel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Chile, it's recommended to contact the providers directly, such as Movistar or Entel, and provide the necessary documentation, such as a passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for those who want to control their costs, but postpaid plans can offer more flexibility.\n- The best internet providers in Chile are Movistar and Entel, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it's recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of subsidies for low-income households.\n- It's also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure you're getting the best deal.",
