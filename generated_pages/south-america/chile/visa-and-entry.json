Citizens of over 90 countries can enter Chile visa-free, making it a relatively accessible destination for tourists and business travelers. The country's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel while ensuring national security and controlling immigration flows. Chile's visa policy is also influenced by its membership in international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).\n\nChile's visa-free policy applies to citizens of countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most European countries, who can stay in the country for up to 90 days without a visa.
