[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Chile's healthcare system is considered mixed, offering both public and private options. The public healthcare system, known as the **National Health Fund (FONASA)**, provides universal access to healthcare services for all citizens, with a focus on primary care and preventive medicine. However, the quality of public healthcare can vary significantly depending on the region and the specific healthcare facility. Private healthcare, on the other hand, is generally of higher quality and offers more specialized services, but it can be expensive. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers private healthcare services, as public healthcare may not be readily available or of the same standard.

The healthcare system in Chile is designed to provide comprehensive coverage to all citizens, with a strong emphasis on preventive care. However, the public system can be overcrowded and underfunded, leading to long wait times and limited access to specialized services. Private healthcare, while more expensive, offers a wider range of services and shorter wait times, making it a popular option for those who can afford it. For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the healthcare system in Chile, including the costs and availability of services, to ensure they receive the best possible care.
