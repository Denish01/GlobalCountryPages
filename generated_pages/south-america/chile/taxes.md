[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Chile's tax system is based on a territorial taxation principle, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are taxed only on their Chilean-sourced income. Residents are considered to be individuals who have a permanent home in Chile, or who have been present in the country for more than six months in a calendar year. The tax authority in Chile is the Servicio de Impuestos Internos (SII), which is responsible for collecting and administering taxes, as well as providing guidance and support to taxpayers.

The Chilean tax system is relatively complex, with a range of taxes and rates applying to different types of income and activities. The tax year in Chile runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of April in the following year. Chile has a network of 32 tax treaties with other countries, which help to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion. These treaties also provide a range of benefits and exemptions for taxpayers, including reduced withholding tax rates on dividends, interest, and royalties.
