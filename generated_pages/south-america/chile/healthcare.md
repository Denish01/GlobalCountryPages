[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Chile's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining public and private providers to offer a wide range of medical services. The public healthcare system, known as **FONASA** (Fondo Nacional de Salud), provides coverage to approximately 70% of the population, while the remaining 30% opt for private insurance. The quality of care in Chile is generally high, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities, especially in urban areas like Santiago. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where resources and specialized services may be scarce. Despite these challenges, Chile's healthcare system is considered one of the best in Latin America, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and public health programs.

The public healthcare system in Chile is funded through a combination of employee and employer contributions, as well as government subsidies. Private insurance, on the other hand, is offered by a range of providers, including international companies and local insurers. Many Chileans choose to supplement their public coverage with private insurance to access additional services and amenities. Overall, Chile's mixed healthcare system provides a range of options for individuals and families, from basic public coverage to comprehensive private plans.

In terms of urban vs rural access, Chile's healthcare system faces significant challenges in providing equal access to medical care across the country. While urban areas like Santiago and Valparaíso have a high concentration of hospitals, clinics, and medical specialists, rural areas often rely on smaller, more basic facilities with limited resources. To address these disparities, the Chilean government has implemented programs to improve healthcare access in rural areas, including the deployment of mobile health units and the expansion of telemedicine services.
