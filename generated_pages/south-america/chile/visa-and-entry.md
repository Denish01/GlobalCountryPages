# Chile Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Chile before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Chile has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. Citizens of over 90 countries can enter Chile visa-free, making it a relatively accessible destination for tourists and business travelers. The country's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel while ensuring national security and controlling immigration flows. Chile's visa policy is also influenced by its membership in international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).

Chile's visa-free policy applies to citizens of countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most European countries, who can stay in the country for up to 90 days without a visa. However, citizens of other countries, such as India and China, require a visa prior to arrival. Chile also offers a visa on arrival for citizens of certain countries, which can be obtained at the airport or border crossing. The country's visa policy is subject to change, so it's essential to check the latest requirements before traveling.
