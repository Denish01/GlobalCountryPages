  "content": "In Chile, the cost of healthcare can vary significantly depending on whether you opt for public or private services, with the overall health expenditure per capita standing at $1,760.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,760\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 39.1%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 131\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: CLP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nChile's healthcare system is considered mixed, offering both public and private options. The public healthcare system, known as the **National Health Fund (FONASA)**, provides universal access to healthcare services for all citizens, with a focus on primary care and preventive medicine. However, the quality of public healthcare can vary significantly depending on the region and the specific healthcare facility. Private healthcare, on the other hand, is generally of higher quality and offers more specialized services, but it can be expensive. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers private healthcare services, as public healthcare may not be readily available or of the same standard.\n\nThe healthcare system in Chile is designed to provide comprehensive coverage to all citizens, with a strong emphasis on preventive care. However, the public system can be overcrowded and underfunded, leading to long wait times and limited access to specialized services. Private healthcare, while more expensive, offers a wider range of services and shorter wait times, making it a popular option for those who can afford it. For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the healthcare system in Chile, including the costs and availability of services, to ensure they receive the best possible care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor's expertise |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's expertise |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by dentist's expertise and location |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by optometrist's expertise and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by laboratory and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| X-Ray | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Covers public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Covers private healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and procedures |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Covers private healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and procedures, with international coverage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are widely available in Chile, with prices varying depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.\n- Over-the-counter medications are also readily available, with prices ranging from $5-$20.\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $10-$30.\n- Pharmacy chains such as **Cruz Verde** and **Farmacias Ahumada** offer a wide range of medications and competitive prices.\n- Prescription rules in Chile are strict, with many medications requiring a doctor's prescription.\n- Medication prices can vary significantly depending on the location and the pharmacy, with prices in larger cities tend to be higher.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 131, or visit the nearest hospital.
