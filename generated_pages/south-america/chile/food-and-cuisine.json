This unique geography has created a diverse range of regional specialties, from the seafood-rich dishes of the coastal regions to the hearty meat stews of the Andean highlands. The indigenous **Mapuche** people have also had a significant influence on Chilean cuisine, introducing crops such as corn, potatoes, and beans. Additionally, Spanish and Italian immigrants have contributed to the development of Chilean cuisine, introducing new ingredients and cooking techniques.\n\nChilean cuisine is known for its bold flavors and hearty portions, with a focus on locally sourced ingredients. The country's long coastline provides an abundance of fresh seafood, which is often used in dishes such as **Chupe de Mariscos**, a rich seafood stew. The Andean highlands are home to a variety of **papas**, or potatoes, which are often used in dishes such as **Cazuela**, a hearty beef stew. The central region of Chile is known for its **vino**, or wine, which is often paired with meals.\n\nThe regional variations in Chilean cuisine are also worth noting. The northern region of Chile is known for its **Ch'arki**, a type of dried beef, while the southern region is famous for its **Cordero al Palo**, a whole roasted lamb. The Easter Island, a Chilean territory in the Pacific Ocean, has a unique cuisine that reflects its Polynesian heritage, with dishes such as **Tunah**, a raw fish dish marinated in coconut milk.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pastel de Choclo** | Main Course | Corn pie filled with ground beef, onions, and chicken | Santiago, Valparaíso |\n| **Chupe de Mariscos** | Seafood Stew | Rich seafood stew with mussels, clams, and fish | Coastal regions, such as Valparaíso and La Serena |\n| **Empanadas** | Snack | Meat or cheese-filled pastries | Street food stalls, markets, and restaurants nationwide |\n| **Cazuela** | Stew | Hearty beef stew with potatoes, carrots, and peas | Traditional restaurants in Santiago and the Andean highlands |\n| **Ch'arki** | Appetizer | Dried beef, often served with cheese and bread | Northern region, particularly in the city of Arica |\n| **Cordero al Palo** | Main Course | Whole roasted lamb, often served with potatoes and vegetables | Southern region, particularly in the city of Punta Arenas |\n| **Tunah** | Appetizer | Raw fish dish marinated in coconut milk, inspired by Polynesian cuisine | Easter Island, a Chilean territory in the Pacific Ocean |\n| **Humitas** | Side Dish | Steamed corn pudding, often served with butter or cheese | Rural areas and traditional restaurants |\n| **Leche Asada** | Dessert | Caramelized milk pudding, often served with cinnamon and sugar | Traditional restaurants and cafes |\n| **Mote con Huesillos** | Dessert | Wheat berries with dried peaches, often served with cinnamon and sugar | Traditional restaurants and cafes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Empanadas**: Meat or cheese-filled pastries, $2-$3 USD\n- **Churros**: Fried dough pastries coated in sugar, $1-$2 USD\n- **Anticuchos**: Grilled beef heart skewers, $3-$4 USD\n- **Papas Fritas**: Fried potatoes, often served with cheese or chili sauce, $2-$3 USD\n- **Ch'arki**: Dried beef, often served with cheese and bread, $4-$5 USD\n- **Completo**: A hot dog topped with avocado, tomato, and mayonnaise, $3-$4 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Pisco Sour**: A cocktail made with **pisco**, a type of brandy, lemon juice, and egg white, $8-$10 USD\n- **Vino**: Chilean wine, with popular varieties such as **Carménère** and **Cabernet Sauvignon**, $10-$20 USD per bottle\n- **Cerveza**: Chilean beer, with popular brands such as **Cristal** and **Heineken**, $3-$5 USD per pint\n- **Chicha**: A sweet, fermented drink made from apples or grapes, $2-$3 USD\n- **Mote con Huesillos**: A sweet drink made from wheat berries and dried peaches, $2-$3 USD\n- **Fresh Juice**: Freshly squeezed juice made from fruits such as orange, grapefruit, or mango, $3-$5 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Reservation**: Reservations are recommended for high-end restaurants, especially on weekends\n- **Tipping**: 10% of the total bill is customary\n- **Dress Code**: Formal attire is required for high-end restaurants, while casual dress is acceptable for informal eateries\n- **Meal Times**: Breakfast is typically served between 8-10 am, lunch between 1-3 pm, and dinner between 8-10 pm\n- **Eating Etiquette**: Keep your hands visible on the table, and wait for the host to indicate where to sit\n- **Bread**: Bread is often served with meals, and it's customary to tear it into small pieces before eating\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Mercados**: Traditional markets, such as the **Mercado Central** in Santiago, offer a wide variety of fresh produce, meat, and seafood\n- **Food Courts**: Modern shopping malls, such as the **Costanera Center** in Santiago, often have food courts with a range of dining options\n- **Restaurants**: Traditional restaurants, such as **La Estación** in Santiago, offer a range of Chilean dishes\n- **Cafes**: Coffee shops, such as **Café Torres** in Santiago, offer a range of coffee drinks and pastries\n- **Street Food Stalls**: Informal eateries, such as **La Vega** in Santiago, offer a range of street food options\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Mercado Central**: A traditional market in Santiago, offering a wide variety of fresh produce, meat, and seafood\n- **La Vega**: A street food market in Santiago, offering a range of informal eateries and food stalls\n- **Feria Chilena**: A weekly market in Valparaíso, offering a range of local produce, crafts, and street food\n- **Vina del Mar**: A coastal town with a range of seafood restaurants and markets, offering fresh seafood and local specialties\n- **Easter Island**: A Chilean territory in the Pacific Ocean, offering a unique culinary experience with dishes such as **Tunah** and **Pescado Frito**",
