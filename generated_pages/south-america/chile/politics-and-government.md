[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Chile is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a four-year term and is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration of the government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Congress, which is a bicameral body consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies has 155 members, who are elected by proportional representation for four-year terms, while the Senate has 50 members, who are elected by proportional representation for eight-year terms. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 21 judges appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

The Chilean political system is characterized by a strong emphasis on the **separation of powers**, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and checks on the others. The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation, while the legislative branch has the power to approve or reject it. The judicial branch, meanwhile, is responsible for interpreting the constitution and ensuring that the government acts in accordance with the law. Chile's **unitary system** means that the central government has significant authority over the country's 16 regions, although there are also elected regional councils and governors who have some degree of autonomy.

The Chilean political system has undergone significant changes in recent years, particularly with the introduction of a new **constitution** in 2022. The new constitution establishes a number of important principles, including the recognition of **indigenous rights** and the protection of the **environment**. It also establishes a more **decentralized system** of government, with greater autonomy for regional governments.
