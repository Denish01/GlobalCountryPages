[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Chile's housing market is characterized by a high demand for rentals, particularly in the capital city of Santiago. The rental market is relatively stable, with typical lease terms ranging from 6-12 months. To secure a rental property, tenants usually need to provide a deposit equivalent to one or two months' rent, as well as proof of income and employment. Tenant rights in Chile are generally well-protected, with laws in place to regulate rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Chile's housing costs are relatively high, with Argentina and Peru offering more affordable options. However, Chile's strong economy and high standard of living make it an attractive destination for expats and foreigners.

The housing market in Chile is also influenced by the country's unique geography, with the Andes mountains running along the eastern edge of the country and the Pacific Ocean to the west. This has led to the development of distinct regions, each with its own character and housing market. The central region, which includes Santiago, is the most populous and economically developed, with a wide range of housing options available. In contrast, the southern regions are more rural and less developed, with lower housing costs and a more relaxed pace of life.
