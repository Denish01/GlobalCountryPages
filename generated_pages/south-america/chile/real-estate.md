[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Chilean property market has experienced steady growth over the past decade, driven by a strong economy, low interest rates, and a growing middle class. The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a focus on urban areas such as Santiago, Valparaiso, and Concepcion. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available at competitive prices. However, prices have been increasing in recent years, particularly in the capital city of Santiago, where the average price per square meter has risen to over $1,500 USD. The rental yield in Chile is relatively high, ranging from 4-6% per annum, making it an attractive option for investors.

The property market in Chile is largely driven by domestic demand, with a growing number of Chileans seeking to own their own homes. However, the market is also attracting international investors, particularly from other Latin American countries and the United States. The urban areas are the most popular, with modern apartments and houses in high demand, while rural areas are also gaining popularity, particularly among retirees and those seeking a more relaxed lifestyle.

The price trajectory in Chile has been steadily increasing, with a growth rate of around 5-7% per annum over the past decade. However, the market is expected to slow down in the coming years, due to a combination of factors, including rising interest rates and a slowdown in the economy. Despite this, the market is expected to remain stable, with a continued demand for properties, particularly in the urban areas.
