On the other hand, private education in Chile is known for its high standards and is often preferred by expats and locals alike, but it comes with a hefty price tag. The language of instruction in Chile is Spanish, and compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Santiago, offering a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.\n\nThe quality of education in Chile varies significantly depending on the type of institution and its location. Public schools in rural areas often struggle with limited resources and outdated facilities, while private schools in urban areas tend to have better infrastructure and more qualified teachers.
