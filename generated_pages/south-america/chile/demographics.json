The country's population growth rate is approximately 0.7%, which is lower than the regional average. Chile has a high level of urbanization, with around 87.7% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Santiago and other major cities like Valparaíso and Concepción. The country's population is also characterized by a relatively high life expectancy, with an average of 79.1 years, and a low fertility rate of 1.7 children per woman.\n\nChile's population growth trends are influenced by factors such as migration patterns, with many Chileans moving to urban areas in search of better job opportunities and living standards.

However, Chile's population growth rate is expected to slow down in the coming years due to declining fertility rates and an aging population.\n\nThe country's urbanization trends have significant implications for the development of cities and the provision of services such as housing, transportation, and healthcare.
