[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Chile's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being generally free or subsidized, but often criticized for its quality and limited resources. On the other hand, private education in Chile is known for its high standards and is often preferred by expats and locals alike, but it comes with a hefty price tag. The language of instruction in Chile is Spanish, and compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18. International schools are also available, particularly in larger cities like Santiago, offering a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.

The quality of education in Chile varies significantly depending on the type of institution and its location. Public schools in rural areas often struggle with limited resources and outdated facilities, while private schools in urban areas tend to have better infrastructure and more qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, Chile has made significant progress in improving its education system in recent years, with a growing number of students pursuing higher education and a increasing emphasis on **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** fields.
