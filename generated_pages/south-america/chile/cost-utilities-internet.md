[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Chile has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a high percentage of households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months (June to August) due to increased demand for heating. The overall quality of the utility infrastructure is good, with minimal disruptions to services. The costs of utilities in Chile are generally stable, but can be affected by inflation, which was 4.3% in 2024.

The cost of utilities in Chile can also vary depending on the region, with the central region, where the capital Santiago is located, tend to have higher costs than other regions. Additionally, the cost of utilities can also depend on the type of accommodation, with apartments in urban areas tend to have higher costs than houses in rural areas. It's worth noting that the Chilean government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, such as subsidies for low-income households.
