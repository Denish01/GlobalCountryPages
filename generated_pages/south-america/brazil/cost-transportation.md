[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Brazil is a vast and diverse country, and the transportation options available vary greatly depending on the region and city. In general, the quality of public transit is good in major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with a comprehensive network of buses, metro lines, and commuter trains. However, in smaller towns and rural areas, public transportation options may be limited, and **private vehicles** or **taxis** may be the primary mode of transportation. Most people in Brazil get around using a combination of public transportation and ride-hailing services, with many also relying on their own vehicles for personal transportation.

The transportation infrastructure in Brazil is constantly evolving, with new metro lines and bus systems being developed in major cities. However, traffic congestion is a significant issue in many urban areas, and **traffic jams** can be a major problem during peak hours. Despite these challenges, Brazil has made significant investments in its transportation infrastructure in recent years, and the country is now home to a number of modern and efficient transportation systems.
