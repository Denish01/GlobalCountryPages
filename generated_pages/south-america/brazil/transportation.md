[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Brazil has several major international airports, with Rio de Janeiro/Galeão International Airport (GIG) and São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (GRU) being the primary entry points for most travelers. These airports offer direct flights to and from many major cities in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. If you're coming from neighboring countries, you can also enter Brazil by land or sea, with several border crossings and ports along its extensive borders. The main overland entry points are located near the cities of Foz do Iguaçu, Ciudad del Este, and Manaus.

In addition to the main airports, Brazil has several other international airports, including those in Brasilia, Belo Horizonte, and Porto Alegre, which offer flights to and from nearby countries and domestic destinations. If you're traveling from within South America, you can also take buses or taxis from neighboring countries, which can be a more affordable option. However, be sure to research the safety and reliability of these services before booking, as some border crossings can be prone to crime and corruption.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Brazil has an extensive domestic air network, with several major airlines offering flights to and from most cities and towns. The main domestic airlines are **Gol Transportes Aéreos**, **LATAM Brasil**, and **Azul Brazilian Airlines**, which offer flights to over 100 destinations across the country. You can book domestic flights online through the airlines' websites or through travel agencies, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. On average, a one-way domestic flight can cost between $100 and $300 USD, depending on the distance and demand.

When booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to research and compare prices across different airlines and book in advance to get the best deals. You can also consider flying into smaller regional airports, which can be more convenient for traveling to rural areas or smaller towns. Additionally, some airlines offer discounts for students, seniors, or military personnel, so be sure to ask about any available promotions when booking.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Brazil's rail network is limited, with most trains operating on short routes in the southeast region. The main rail lines connect the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte, with several commuter trains and tourist trains operating on these routes. However, there are no high-speed trains in Brazil, and most trains are geared towards freight transport rather than passenger travel. If you're interested in taking the train, you can book tickets through the **Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos (CBTU)** website or at train stations.

While the train network is limited, it can be a scenic and relaxing way to travel, especially on tourist trains that operate on historic routes. However, be aware that trains can be slower and less frequent than buses or flights, and may not be as convenient for traveling long distances. Additionally, some trains may not offer food or beverage service, so be sure to bring your own snacks and drinks.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Brazil has an extensive network of intercity buses, with several major companies operating on routes across the country. The main bus companies are **Ormeño**, **Util**, and **Cometa**, which offer a range of services from basic to luxury. Bus travel can be a more affordable option than flying, with prices starting from around $20 USD for short routes and up to $100 USD for longer journeys. You can book bus tickets online through the companies' websites or at bus stations, and be sure to research the quality and safety of the service before booking.

When taking the bus, be aware that roads can be rough and winding, especially in rural areas, and journeys can take longer than expected. However, buses can be a convenient and affordable way to travel, especially for shorter routes or for those on a budget. Additionally, some bus companies offer onboard amenities such as food, drinks, and Wi-Fi, so be sure to research these services before booking.
