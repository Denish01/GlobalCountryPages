[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Brazil's government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the country's constitution, which ensures that each branch has distinct responsibilities and checks on the others. The federal system gives significant autonomy to the 26 states and over 5,500 municipalities, allowing them to manage their own affairs and provide public services. The **federal government**, on the other hand, is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, national defense, and macroeconomic policy. Brazil's **democratic system** is characterized by free and fair elections, an independent judiciary, and a free press.

The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is both the head of state and head of government. The president is directly elected by the people for a four-year term and is limited to two consecutive terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Congress, which is a bicameral legislature consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Federal Court, which is the highest court in the land and has the final say on constitutional matters.

The Brazilian **political system** is also characterized by a strong emphasis on **social welfare** and **human rights**. The country has a comprehensive system of social security, which includes programs such as Bolsa Família, which provides cash transfers to poor families who keep their children in school and receive regular health check-ups. Brazil is also a signatory to several international human rights treaties, including the American Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
