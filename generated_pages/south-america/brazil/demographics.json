  "content": "The population of Brazil is a diverse and complex mix of ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups, with approximately 216 million people living in the country, making it the largest population in both South America and the Latin American region.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 216.0 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.7%\nMedian Age: 33.5 years\nUrban Population: 87.5%\nPopulation Density: 25.4 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 75.6 years\nFertility Rate: 1.7 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nBrazil has the sixth-largest population in the world, and its population size is significant in the context of the South American continent. The country's population has been growing steadily, with an average annual growth rate of 0.7%, although this rate has been declining in recent years. The population is predominantly urban, with approximately 87.5% of the population living in cities, which has led to the growth of large metropolitan areas such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has also experienced significant migration patterns, both internally and internationally, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of Brazil is also characterized by a significant regional diversity, with different parts of the country experiencing different population growth trends and demographic characteristics. The northeastern region, for example, has a higher population growth rate than the southern region, which has a more aging population. The country's population is also affected by migration patterns, with many Brazilians moving to other countries in search of better economic opportunities, while at the same time, the country receives immigrants from other parts of the world.\n\nThe demographic trends in Brazil have significant implications for the country's economic and social development. The aging population, for example, will require significant investments in healthcare and social security, while the urbanization trend will require investments in infrastructure and urban planning. The country's population growth rate is also expected to decline in the coming years, which will have implications for the labor market and the country's economic growth.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| European | 47.7% | South and Southeast | Mostly of Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish descent |\n| African | 43.1% | Northeast and North | Brought to Brazil as slaves, many have mixed ancestry |\n| Multiracial | 7.6% | Throughout the country | Mixed European, African, and indigenous ancestry |\n| Indigenous | 0.4% | Amazon region | Over 300 distinct ethnic groups |\n| Asian | 2.2% | South and Southeast | Mostly of Japanese and Chinese descent |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity of Brazil is a significant aspect of the country's population, with a mix of European, African, and indigenous groups.
