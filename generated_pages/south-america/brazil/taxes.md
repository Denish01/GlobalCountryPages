[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Brazil's tax system is based on a **territorial taxation** principle, where individuals and companies are taxed on income earned within the country, regardless of their tax residency status. However, **worldwide taxation** applies to residents, who are taxed on their global income, with foreign income subject to taxation in Brazil, but foreign tax credits are available to avoid double taxation. Residency rules for tax purposes in Brazil are based on the **183-day rule**, where individuals who stay in the country for more than 183 days in a 12-month period are considered tax residents.

The tax system in Brazil is complex, with multiple taxes levied at the federal, state, and municipal levels. The **Brazilian Revenue Service** (Receita Federal) is responsible for collecting taxes, and taxpayers can file their tax returns online or through a tax professional. Brazil has a **tax identification number** (CPF) for individuals and a **company tax ID** (CNPJ) for businesses, which are required for tax purposes.
