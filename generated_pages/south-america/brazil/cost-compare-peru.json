Brazil is the largest economy in the region, with a strong service sector and a large industrial base, while Peru has a more diverse economy with a strong mining sector and a growing tourism industry. In terms of cost of living, Peru is generally cheaper than Brazil, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. The cost of living in Brazil is around 20-30% higher than in Peru, making Peru a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees on a budget.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Brazil has a more developed economy and a larger middle class, which drives up prices for goods and services. Peru, on the other hand, has a more unequal economy, with a smaller middle class and a larger informal sector, which keeps prices lower. Additionally, the exchange rate between the Brazilian real and the Peruvian sol can also affect the cost of living, with the sol being generally weaker than the real. Overall, Peru offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a lower cost of living and a more relaxed pace of life.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Brazil (USD) | Peru (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 300 | 200 | 33% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 550 | 31% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Brazil (USD) | Peru (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 33% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 80 | 20% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 2 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Brazil (USD) | Peru (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.5 | 1 | 33% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 1 | 17% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Brazil (USD) | Peru (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 80 | 20% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 25 | 17% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Brazil (USD) | Peru (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 550 | 31% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 900 | 25% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,500 | 25% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Brazil is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and dining\n- Luxury hotels and resorts\n- International flights and travel\n- Advanced medical care and health services\n- **Peru is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation and housing\n- Food and dining\n- Transportation and fuel\n- Basic utilities and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nPeru offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a lower cost of living and a more relaxed pace of life.
