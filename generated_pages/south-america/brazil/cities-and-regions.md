[SECTION] How Brazil Is Divided [/SECTION]
Brazil is divided into 26 states, each with its own government and administrative structure. These states are further divided into municipalities, which are the basic units of local government. The country is also divided into five main regions: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. Each region has its unique cultural, economic, and geographical characteristics. The division of Brazil into these regions is largely based on historical, economic, and geographical factors.

The administrative structure of Brazil is designed to provide a balance between the federal government and the states. The federal government is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, national defense, and economic policy, while the states have a significant degree of autonomy in areas such as education, healthcare, and public safety. This division of power allows for a degree of regional autonomy and flexibility, while also ensuring that the country is governed in a unified and cohesive manner.
