[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Brazil's housing market is characterized by a mix of modern and historic buildings, with a wide range of options available for renters and buyers. The rental market is relatively competitive, particularly in large cities like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, where demand is high and supply is limited. Typical lease terms in Brazil range from 12 to 24 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with the **Lei do Inquilino** (Tenant Law) governing the relationship between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Brazil's housing costs are generally higher, particularly in the city centers, but still relatively affordable compared to countries in North America and Europe.

The housing market in Brazil is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including the **inflation rate** and **GDP per capita**. With an inflation rate of 4.4% and a GDP per capita of $22,338, the country's economy is relatively stable, but prices can fluctuate depending on the region and type of property. Additionally, the **health expenditure per capita** and **education spend** can also impact the housing market, as these factors can influence the overall cost of living in Brazil.
