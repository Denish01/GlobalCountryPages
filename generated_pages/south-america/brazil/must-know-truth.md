# The Truth About Brazil - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Brazil, the largest country in both South America and the Latin American region, has a rich and complex history. The country was first inhabited by indigenous peoples, with the arrival of the Portuguese in the early 16th century marking the beginning of European colonization. In 1532, the Portuguese established the first permanent settlement in Brazil, and over the next several centuries, the country became a major hub for the Portuguese Empire. Brazil declared its independence from Portugal on September 7, 1822, with Dom Pedro I as its first emperor. The country became a republic in 1889, following a military coup that overthrew the monarchy.

The colonial period in Brazil was marked by the establishment of a plantation-based economy, with the cultivation of crops such as sugar, coffee, and tobacco. The country also became a major hub for the transatlantic slave trade, with millions of Africans brought to Brazil against their will. The legacy of this period can still be seen in the country's cultural and demographic makeup. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil experienced a period of rapid modernization and urbanization, with the country becoming a major industrial and economic power in the region.

Brazil's history has also been marked by periods of political instability and authoritarianism. The country was ruled by a military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, during which time many civil liberties were suppressed and opposition to the government was not tolerated. Since the return of democracy in 1985, Brazil has made significant progress in areas such as human rights, social welfare, and economic development. Today, Brazil is a **federal republic** with a **presidential system**, and is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations, the G20, and the Organization of American States.

The country is home to a wide range of ecosystems, including the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal wetlands, and the Atlantic Forest.
