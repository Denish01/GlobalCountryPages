# Brazil Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Brazil's infrastructure is a complex and multifaceted system, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's **transportation networks**, **energy generation**, and **telecommunications**, but still faces challenges in terms of **rural-urban disparities** and **infrastructure gaps**.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 99.5% of population
Internet Penetration: 71.3%
Road Network: 1,580,000 km, moderate to poor quality in some areas
Rail Network: 28,538 km
Major Airports: 132
Major Ports: 34
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Brazil's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other countries in South America, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's transportation networks, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges in terms of rural-urban disparities and infrastructure gaps. The government has launched several initiatives to address these issues, including the **Growth Acceleration Program** (PAC), which aims to invest in infrastructure development and improve the country's competitiveness. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's **highway system**, expanding its **port infrastructure**, and increasing its **renewable energy** capacity.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge in Brazil, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as **electricity**, **water**, and **sanitation**. The government has launched several initiatives to address this issue, including the **Light for All** program, which aims to provide electricity to all rural households by 2025. Despite these efforts, significant challenges remain, and the country will need to continue to invest in infrastructure development to address these disparities and promote more **inclusive growth**.

Brazil's infrastructure development is also influenced by its **geography**, with the country's vast size and diverse terrain presenting significant challenges for infrastructure development. The country's **Amazon region**, for example, is home to significant **hydroelectric** resources, but the region's remote location and lack of infrastructure make it difficult to develop these resources. Similarly, the country's **northeast region** is prone to **droughts**, which can impact the reliability of its **water supply** and **energy generation**.
