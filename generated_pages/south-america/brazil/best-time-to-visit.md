[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Brazil is a vast country, spanning across the equator, and its climate varies greatly from region to region. The country can be divided into five main climate zones: equatorial, tropical, semi-arid, temperate, and subtropical. The dry season, which typically runs from May to September, is characterized by low humidity and clear skies, making it an ideal time to visit the northern and northeastern regions. In contrast, the wet season, which runs from October to April, brings heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it more challenging to travel, especially in the Amazon region.

The seasons in Brazil have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to explore the country's beaches, forests, and waterfalls. The wet season, on the other hand, is ideal for spotting wildlife, such as dolphins and whales, and experiencing the lush green landscapes. The southern regions of Brazil, such as Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, have a more temperate climate, with cold winters and mild summers, making them ideal for visiting during the spring and autumn seasons.

The seasons also affect the prices of accommodations and tourist services, with the peak season, which runs from December to March, being the most expensive time to visit Brazil. The budget season, which runs from April to June and September to November, offers more affordable prices and fewer crowds, making it an excellent time to explore the country's cultural and historical attractions.
