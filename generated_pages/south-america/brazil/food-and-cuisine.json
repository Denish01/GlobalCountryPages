The native Tupi people introduced staples like **mandioca** (cassava) and **azeite de dendê** (palm oil), while African slaves brought their own culinary traditions, such as the use of **coconut milk** and **malagueta peppers**. European immigrants, particularly from Portugal and Italy, also left their mark on Brazilian cuisine, with dishes like **feijoada** and **esfiha** (meat or cheese pastries). Regional variations are also significant, with the Northeast known for its **acarajé** (fried dough filled with shrimp or peanuts) and the South for its **churrasco** (grilled meats).\n\nThe country's vast geography and climate also play a role in shaping its cuisine, with the Amazon region offering an abundance of fresh fish and fruits, while the Pantanal wetlands are famous for their **piranha** and **caiman**. Brazilian cuisine is also known for its bold flavors and spices, with **malagueta peppers** and **coconut milk** being staples in many dishes. The country's cultural heritage is also reflected in its cuisine, with many dishes being prepared and shared during social gatherings and festivals.\n\nBrazilian cuisine is not just about the food itself, but also about the cultural and social context in which it is prepared and consumed. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to socialize and bond with family and friends, and the preparation of meals is often a communal effort. The country's cuisine is also closely tied to its music and dance traditions, with many dishes being served during festivals and celebrations like **Carnaval** and **Festa do Divino**.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| feijoada | stew | hearty stew made with black beans and various meats | Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo |\n| churrasco | grilled meat | grilled meats, often served with rice, beans, and farofa | Southern Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul |\n| acarajé | fried dough | fried dough filled with shrimp or peanuts, often served as a snack | Northeastern Brazil, Salvador |\n| moqueca | seafood stew | seafood stew made with coconut milk and spices | Northeastern Brazil, Bahia |\n| esfiha | pastry | meat or cheese pastry, often served as a snack | São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro |\n| açaí na tigela | fruit bowl | frozen açaí berries topped with granola and banana | Amazon region, Manaus |\n| coxinha | fried chicken | fried chicken filled with catupiry cheese, often served as a snack | São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro |\n| pão de queijo | cheese bread | crispy cheese bread, often served as a side dish | Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte |\n| tacacá | soup | creamy soup made with shrimp, coconut milk, and spices | Northeastern Brazil, Recife |\n| brigadeiro | dessert | rich chocolate truffle made with sweetened condensed milk | Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Acarajé**: fried dough filled with shrimp or peanuts, often served as a snack (USD 3-5)\n- **Coxinha**: fried chicken filled with catupiry cheese, often served as a snack (USD 2-3)\n- **Esfiha**: meat or cheese pastry, often served as a snack (USD 1-2)\n- **Pão de queijo**: crispy cheese bread, often served as a side dish (USD 1-2)\n- **Pastel**: deep-fried pastry filled with meat, cheese, or shrimp (USD 2-3)\n- **Tapioca**: crispy tapioca flour pancake, often filled with coconut or cheese (USD 2-3)\n- **Açaí na tigela**: frozen açaí berries topped with granola and banana (USD 5-7)\n- **Churros**: fried dough pastry coated in sugar, often served with chocolate or caramel sauce (USD 3-5)\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Caipirinha**: classic cocktail made with cachaça, lime, and sugar (USD 5-7)\n- **Guaraná**: sweet and creamy soft drink made from guarana fruit (USD 2-3)\n- **Açaí juice**: refreshing juice made from frozen açaí berries (USD 3-5)\n- **Coconut water**: refreshing and hydrating drink made from young coconuts (USD 2-3)\n- **Cachaça**: strong spirit made from sugarcane juice, often used in cocktails (USD 5-10)\n- **Fresh coconut water**: refreshing and hydrating drink made from young coconuts (USD 2-3)\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Mealtime is a social occasion, and mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends\n- It's customary to wait for the host to indicate where to sit and to start eating\n- Table manners are generally formal, with an emphasis on using utensils and not eating with your hands\n- Tipping is customary, with 10% of the total bill being the standard\n- Reservations are often necessary, especially in popular restaurants\n- Dress codes vary, but it's generally a good idea to dress modestly and avoid revealing clothing\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Restaurants**: formal establishments serving a wide range of dishes, from traditional Brazilian cuisine to international fare\n- **Food courts**: casual establishments offering a variety of dishes, often at a lower price point than restaurants\n- **Markets**: vibrant and bustling markets offering a wide range of fresh produce, meats, and prepared dishes\n- **Street food stalls**: informal establishments serving a variety of snacks and dishes, often at a low price point\n- **Buffet restaurants**: establishments offering a wide range of dishes, often at a fixed price point\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Mercado Municipal**: historic market in São Paulo offering a wide range of fresh produce, meats, and prepared dishes\n- **Feira de São Cristóvão**: vibrant market in Rio de Janeiro offering a wide range of traditional Brazilian dishes and snacks\n- **Festa do Divino**: annual festival in Paraná offering a wide range of traditional Brazilian dishes and drinks\n- **Açaí farms**: farms in the Amazon region offering tours and tastings of açaí berries and other local produce\n- **Churrascaria**: traditional Brazilian steakhouse offering a wide range of grilled meats and sides",
