The public system, known as the **Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS)**, provides universal access to healthcare for all citizens, including those in rural areas. However, the quality of care and access to specialized services can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. In urban areas, such as Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, there are modern hospitals and clinics that offer high-quality care, while in rural areas, access to healthcare services can be limited.\n\nThe private healthcare system in Amazonas is also well-developed, with many private hospitals and clinics offering specialized services, including **orthopedics**, **cardiology**, and **oncology**. These facilities often have modern equipment and well-trained staff, but can be expensive for those without private insurance. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in Brazil, as the public system may not provide the same level of care and amenities.\n\nDespite the challenges, the healthcare system in Amazonas has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in **infant mortality rates**, **vaccination coverage**, and **access to healthcare services**. However, there are still significant disparities in healthcare access and outcomes, particularly in rural areas, where **poverty**, **lack of access to education**, and **limited healthcare resources** can exacerbate health problems.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital Universitário Getúlio Vargas | Manaus | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Hospital Adventista de Manaus | Manaus | Private | Cardiology, oncology, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Clinica de Especialidades de Manaus | Manaus | Private | Dermatology, gastroenterology, neurology | Yes |\n| Hospital de Campanha de Manaus | Manaus | Public | Emergency medicine, trauma care | Limited |\n| Hospital São José | Manaus | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Clinica Amazonas | Manaus | Private | Plastic surgery, ophthalmology, urology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Private health insurance is recommended for foreigners and those who want access to high-quality healthcare services.\n- Local insurance options, such as **Amil** and **SulAmerica**, offer a range of plans and coverage options.\n- Expats and foreigners can also purchase international health insurance plans that cover them in Brazil.\n- The cost of health insurance in Amazonas can vary depending on the type of plan and coverage, but expect to pay around **R$500-1000** per month for a basic plan.\n- Some employers in Amazonas may offer health insurance as a benefit to their employees, so it's worth checking with your employer to see if this is an option.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, such as Manaus, and offer a range of medications and healthcare products.\n- Prescription medications are available at most pharmacies, but may require a prescription from a licensed physician.\n- Common brands, such as **Pfizer** and **GlaxoSmithKline**, are widely available, as well as generic options.\n- The cost of medications in Amazonas can vary depending on the type and brand, but expect to pay around **R$20-50** for a basic prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- Vaccinations against **yellow fever**, **hepatitis A**, and **typhoid** are recommended for travelers to Amazonas.\n- The region is also at risk for **malaria**, **dengue fever**, and **Zika virus**, so take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- Water safety is a concern in some areas, so it's recommended to drink bottled or filtered water.\n- Food safety is also a concern, so make sure to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and seafood.\n- The **Amazon rainforest** can be a challenging environment, so make sure to take precautions against **heat exhaustion**, **dehydration**, and **wildlife encounters**.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Amazonas is not a major destination for medical tourism, but some hospitals and clinics in Manaus offer specialized services, such as **plastic surgery** and **orthopedic surgery**.\n- Accredited hospitals, such as the **Hospital Adventista de Manaus**, offer high-quality care and amenities.\n- The cost of medical procedures in Amazonas can be lower than in other countries, but expect to pay around **R$5,000-10,000** for a basic procedure.\n- Some clinics and hospitals may offer package deals that include accommodations and transportation, so it's worth shopping around to find the best option.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In an emergency, call **192** for an ambulance or go to the nearest hospital.\n- The **Hospital de Campanha de Manaus** is a public hospital that offers emergency services, including trauma care.\n- The **Hospital Adventista de Manaus** is a private hospital that offers emergency services, including cardiac care and surgery.\n- Make sure to have your insurance information and identification with you, as well as any relevant medical records.\n- If you are a foreigner, it's recommended to have a **portable health insurance plan** that covers you in Brazil, as well as a **credit card** or other form of payment in case of an emergency.",
