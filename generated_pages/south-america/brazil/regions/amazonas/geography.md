[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Amazonas is situated in the northern part of Brazil, covering nearly 60% of the country's land area. It shares international borders with several countries, including Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The region is surrounded by the Guiana Shield to the north, the Brazilian Shield to the south, and the Andes Mountains to the west. The Amazon River, the largest river in the world by discharge volume, flows through the region and plays a crucial role in shaping its geography and climate.

The location of Amazonas has a significant impact on its climate and ecosystem. The region's proximity to the equator and its low elevation contribute to its tropical climate, with high temperatures and high levels of rainfall throughout the year. The Amazon River and its numerous tributaries also support an incredibly diverse array of plant and animal species, making Amazonas one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet. The region's borders with other countries also make it an important location for international trade and cultural exchange.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Amazonas is characterized by vast expanses of **tropical rainforest**, including the famous Amazon Rainforest, which covers nearly 80% of the region. The region's landscape is also marked by numerous rivers, including the Amazon River, the Rio Negro, and the Madeira River, which provide transportation routes and support a wide range of aquatic life. The terrain is generally flat, with some hills and mountains in the western and northern parts of the region. The highest point in Amazonas is Pico da Neblina, which rises to an elevation of 2,995 meters.

In addition to its rainforests and rivers, Amazonas is also home to a variety of other landscapes, including **savannas**, **grasslands**, and **floodplains**. The region's diverse terrain and climate support an incredibly wide range of plant and animal species, including thousands of types of birds, mammals, reptiles, and insects. The Amazon Rainforest is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" due to its critical role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide. The region's terrain and landscape also make it an important location for **ecotourism**, with many visitors drawn to its natural beauty and biodiversity.

The region's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by human activity, including **deforestation** and **agriculture**. The clearing of land for farming and ranching has led to significant losses of rainforest and biodiversity, and has contributed to climate change. However, efforts are being made to protect the region's natural resources and to promote sustainable land use practices.
