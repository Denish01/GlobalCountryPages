[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Amazonas is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public system, known as the **Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS)**, provides universal access to healthcare for all citizens, including those in rural areas. However, the quality of care and access to specialized services can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. In urban areas, such as Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, there are modern hospitals and clinics that offer high-quality care, while in rural areas, access to healthcare services can be limited.

The private healthcare system in Amazonas is also well-developed, with many private hospitals and clinics offering specialized services, including **orthopedics**, **cardiology**, and **oncology**. These facilities often have modern equipment and well-trained staff, but can be expensive for those without private insurance. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in Brazil, as the public system may not provide the same level of care and amenities.

Despite the challenges, the healthcare system in Amazonas has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in **infant mortality rates**, **vaccination coverage**, and **access to healthcare services**. However, there are still significant disparities in healthcare access and outcomes, particularly in rural areas, where **poverty**, **lack of access to education**, and **limited healthcare resources** can exacerbate health problems.
