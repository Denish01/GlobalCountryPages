The region shares borders with several other Brazilian states, including São Paulo to the south, Rio de Janeiro to the southeast, Espírito Santo to the east, Bahia to the northeast, Goiás to the northwest, Mato Grosso do Sul to the west, and the Federal District to the north. Minas Gerais is a landlocked region, with no direct access to the ocean, but it is drained by several major rivers, including the São Francisco, Paraná, and Jequitinhonha rivers.

The location of Minas Gerais has played a significant role in shaping the region's history, culture, and economy. The region's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, although indirect, has facilitated trade and cultural exchange with other parts of Brazil and the world. The borders of Minas Gerais have also influenced the region's ethnic and linguistic diversity, with various indigenous and European groups having settled in the area over the centuries. Today, Minas Gerais is a hub of economic activity, with major cities like Belo Horizonte, the capital, and Juiz de Fora contributing to the region's growth and development.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Minas Gerais is characterized by a diverse landscape, with a range of mountains, valleys, and plateaus. The region's terrain is dominated by the **Serra do Espinhaço** mountain range, which stretches for over 1,100 kilometers and divides the region into two distinct areas: the **Sertão**, a dry and semi-arid region to the north, and the **Zona da Mata**, a more humid and fertile region to the south. The **Serra da Canastra** mountain range is another notable feature of the region, known for its stunning natural beauty and rich biodiversity.

The region's landscape is also marked by numerous rivers, including the São Francisco, Paraná, and Jequitinhonha rivers, which have carved out valleys and canyons over millions of years. The **Canyon of the Guimarães River**, for example, is a popular tourist destination, with its stunning rock formations and scenic views. Minas Gerais is also home to several major lakes, including the **Lake Furnas** and **Lake Sobradinho**, which are important sources of hydroelectric power and support a wide range of aquatic life.

The region's terrain has played a significant role in shaping its economy and culture, with mining, agriculture, and tourism being major industries. The **diamond mines** of Diamantina, for example, have been an important source of wealth for the region, while the **coffee plantations** of the Zona da Mata have contributed to Brazil's reputation as a major coffee producer. The region's natural beauty, including its mountains, rivers, and waterfalls, has also made it a popular destination for tourists and outdoor enthusiasts.
