Minas Gerais is a large and geographically diverse region in southeastern Brazil, spanning across different climate zones. The state can be divided into three main climate zones: the tropical savanna climate in the north, the humid subtropical climate in the south, and the tropical monsoon climate in the east. The region experiences a distinct dry season from June to September and a wet season from October to May. The dry season is characterized by low humidity and mild temperatures, while the wet season is marked by high humidity and warm temperatures. The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Minas Gerais, with the dry season being the best time to visit the northern regions and the wet season being ideal for exploring the southern regions.

The climate in Minas Gerais varies greatly depending on the elevation and latitude. The southern regions, such as the Serra do Cipó National Park, experience a cooler climate, with average temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F) during the winter months. In contrast, the northern regions, such as the city of Montes Claros, experience a warmer climate, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F) during the summer months.
