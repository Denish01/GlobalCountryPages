[SECTION] How Minas Gerais Is Divided [/SECTION]
Minas Gerais is divided into 12 mesoregions, which are further subdivided into 70 microregions, and then into 853 municipalities. This administrative structure allows for a more localized approach to governance and development, taking into account the unique characteristics and needs of each region. The state's mesoregions are defined by their geographical features, economic activities, and cultural identities, ranging from the rugged mountains of the southeast to the fertile valleys of the northwest.

The division of Minas Gerais into mesoregions and microregions also reflects the state's history and colonization patterns. The southeastern part of the state, for example, was heavily influenced by European immigration, particularly from Italy and Portugal, which has left a lasting legacy in the region's architecture, cuisine, and cultural traditions. In contrast, the northern part of the state has a more indigenous and African influence, with many communities still maintaining their traditional ways of life.
