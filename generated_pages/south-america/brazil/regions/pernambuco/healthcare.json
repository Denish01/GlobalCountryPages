  "content": "Pernambuco, a region in northeastern Brazil, has a mixed healthcare system that offers a range of public and private healthcare options, with varying levels of quality and accessibility.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 192\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Pernambuco is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public system is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost healthcare to all citizens, including foreigners with a valid visa. However, the public system often faces challenges such as long wait times, limited resources, and a shortage of specialized doctors. The private system, on the other hand, offers higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but is generally more expensive and may not be accessible to all. In urban areas, such as the capital city of Recife, there are many high-quality hospitals and clinics, both public and private, that offer a wide range of specialized services. In rural areas, however, access to healthcare can be limited, and patients may have to travel long distances to receive specialized care.\n\nThe quality of care in Pernambuco varies depending on the provider and the location. In general, the public system provides good basic care, but may not have the resources or specialized equipment to provide more complex treatments. The private system, on the other hand, offers high-quality care, with many hospitals and clinics having international accreditation and modern equipment. Despite these challenges, Pernambuco has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with investments in new hospitals, clinics, and healthcare technology.\n\nIn terms of access to healthcare, Pernambuco has a relatively high density of healthcare providers, with many hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies located throughout the region. However, there are still significant disparities in access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas, where there may be limited access to specialized care and healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hospital das Clínicas | Recife | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Real Hospital Português | Recife | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Hospital Memorial | Olinda | Private | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Yes |\n| Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira | Recife | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Hospital Universitário Oswaldo Cruz | Recife | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency medicine | Limited |\n| Clínica São Francisco | Jaboatão dos Guararapes | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and Brazilians who want to access high-quality private healthcare services.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, such as Amil, SulAmerica, and Porto Seguro, which offer a range of plans and coverage options.\n- **Coverage for expats** is available through some private insurance companies, which may offer international coverage and emergency evacuation services.\n- **Costs** of health insurance vary depending on the provider, plan, and level of coverage, but can range from R$500 to R$5,000 per month.\n- **Public health insurance** is available through the Brazilian public healthcare system, which provides free or low-cost healthcare to all citizens, including foreigners with a valid visa.\n- **Supplemental insurance** is available to supplement the public healthcare system, which can provide additional coverage and benefits.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Availability of medications** is generally good in Pernambuco, with many pharmacies and drugstores located throughout the region.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many medications are available over-the-counter or with a prescription from a doctor.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including international brands and generic versions.\n- **Costs** of medications vary depending on the type and brand, but are generally lower than in many other countries.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies open 24 hours a day and located in convenient locations.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Pernambuco include yellow fever, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include hepatitis B, rabies, and influenza.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Pernambuco include dengue fever, Zika virus, and chikungunya.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in some areas, and visitors should take precautions to avoid drinking untreated water.\n- **Food safety** is generally good, but visitors should take precautions to avoid eating undercooked or raw foods.\n- **Vector-borne diseases** such as malaria and leishmaniasis are present in some areas, and visitors should take precautions to avoid insect bites.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Pernambuco include cosmetic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and dental procedures.\n- **Accredited hospitals** such as the Real Hospital Português and the Hospital Memorial offer high-quality care and modern facilities.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many procedures costing 50-70% less than in the US or Europe.\n- **Language support** is available at many hospitals and clinics, with many doctors and staff speaking English and other languages.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **What to do in an emergency** is to call the emergency number 192 or go to the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with many hospitals and clinics having their own ambulance services.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a mapping app such as Google Maps.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted to the insurance company as soon as possible, with all necessary documentation and receipts.\n- **Emergency services** such as emergency rooms and urgent care centers are available at many hospitals and clinics, and can provide immediate attention and treatment.",
