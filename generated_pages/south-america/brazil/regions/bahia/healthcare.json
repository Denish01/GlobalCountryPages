The private system, on the other hand, offers higher quality care but is generally more expensive and accessible only to those with private insurance. The quality of care in Bahia is generally good, with many well-equipped hospitals and specialized clinics, especially in the capital city of Salvador. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be scarce. Urban areas, such as Salvador and other major cities, tend to have better access to healthcare services, including specialized care and emergency services.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Bahia is part of the **Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS)**, which provides universal access to healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and medications.

Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a range of services, from basic medical care to specialized treatments, but often require private insurance or out-of-pocket payment.\n\nOverall, the healthcare system in Bahia is complex and multifaceted, with both public and private options available.
