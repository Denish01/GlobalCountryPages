[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Bahia is a region in northeastern Brazil, characterized by a tropical climate with two distinct seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, which runs from September to March, is marked by warm and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C (77°F to 86°F). This is the best time to visit Bahia, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, swimming, and exploring the region's beautiful beaches. The wet season, which runs from April to August, is characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less suitable for outdoor activities.

The climate in Bahia varies depending on the region, with the coastal areas tend to be cooler and more humid than the interior. The **Chapada Diamantina** region, located in the interior of Bahia, has a more temperate climate, with cooler temperatures and less humidity than the coastal areas. The **Atlantic Forest**, which covers much of the coastal region, is characterized by a hot and humid climate, with heavy rainfall during the wet season.

The seasons in Bahia have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, the region's popular beaches and attractions are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are higher. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices, but also more limited access to outdoor activities and attractions.
