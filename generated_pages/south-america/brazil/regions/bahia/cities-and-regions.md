[SECTION] How Bahia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Bahia is the fifth-most populous state in Brazil and is divided into 417 municipalities, each with its own local government. The state is further divided into seven mesoregions, which are groups of municipalities that share similar economic, social, and cultural characteristics. These mesoregions are then divided into 32 microregions, which are smaller groups of municipalities that are often centered around a major city or urban area.

The administrative structure of Bahia is designed to provide a framework for the delivery of public services, such as education, healthcare, and transportation, to the state's population of over 15 million people. The state government is responsible for providing these services, as well as for promoting economic development and tourism in the region. The municipalities, on the other hand, are responsible for providing local services, such as trash collection and public safety, to their residents.
