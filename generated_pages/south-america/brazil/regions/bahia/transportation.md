[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Bahia is a region in the northeastern part of Brazil, and the main entry point is Salvador International Airport (SSA), which receives direct flights from major cities in Brazil and some international flights from South America and Europe. You can also enter Bahia by bus or car from neighboring states, such as Sergipe, Alagoas, and Pernambuco. The main overland entry points are the cities of Salvador, Feira de Santana, and Vitória da Conquista, which are connected to the rest of Brazil by the BR-101 and BR-116 highways.

If you are coming from outside Brazil, you will likely need to connect through a major airport in Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, and then take a domestic flight to Salvador. Some airlines, such as LATAM and Gol, offer direct flights from these cities to Salvador, while others may require a connection. It is also possible to enter Bahia by sea, with several ports and marinas along the coast, including the Port of Salvador, which receives cargo ships and cruise liners.

To get around Bahia and the rest of Brazil, you can use the domestic air network, which is extensive and connects most major cities. The main domestic airlines are LATAM, Gol, and Azul, which offer frequent flights between Salvador and other cities in the region, such as Ilhéus, Porto Seguro, and Lençóis. You can book flights online through the airlines' websites or through travel agencies, and it is recommended to book in advance to get the best prices. Approximate costs for domestic flights in Brazil range from $50 to $200 USD, depending on the route and time of year.

The rail network in Bahia is limited, with only a few lines connecting the cities of Salvador, Feira de Santana, and Alagoinhas. The trains are operated by the Brazilian railway company, Vale, and are mainly used for freight transport. There are no high-speed trains in Bahia, and the existing lines are not well-maintained, so train travel is not a convenient option for tourists. However, there are plans to expand and modernize the rail network in the future, which could improve transportation options in the region.
