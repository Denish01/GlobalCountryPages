[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Parana is a region in southern Brazil, spanning across different climate zones, including subtropical and temperate regions. The state experiences a distinct dry season from March to November and a wet season from December to February. The dry season is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it an ideal time for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and visiting the region's many waterfalls. In contrast, the wet season brings heavy rainfall and higher temperatures, which can make it challenging to explore the region's rural areas.

The seasons in Parana also affect travel, with the peak season coinciding with the summer months in the Southern Hemisphere, from December to February. During this time, the region's popular tourist destinations, such as the **Iguaçu Falls** and the **Vila Velha State Park**, are crowded with visitors, and prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher. In contrast, the shoulder season, from April to June and September to November, offers a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices, making it an attractive option for travelers on a budget.

The regional climate variations also play a significant role in determining the best time to visit Parana. The north of the state, which borders the state of São Paulo, experiences a more pronounced wet season, with heavy rainfall from November to March. In contrast, the south of the state, which borders Argentina and Uruguay, is characterized by a more temperate climate, with mild winters and hot summers.
