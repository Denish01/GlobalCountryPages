Rio Grande do Sul is situated in the southern region of Brazil, covering an area of approximately 281,707 square kilometers. The state is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, which provides a long coastline with beautiful beaches and scenic views. To the south, Rio Grande do Sul shares an international border with Uruguay, while to the west, it borders Argentina. The state is also surrounded by the Brazilian states of Santa Catarina to the north and Paraná to the northeast. The unique location of Rio Grande do Sul, where the **Pampas** region meets the Atlantic Ocean, creates a diverse landscape with varying climates and ecosystems.

The state's location has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The border with Uruguay and Argentina has facilitated trade and cultural exchange between the countries, while the coastline has enabled the development of a strong maritime industry. The capital city of Rio Grande do Sul, **Porto Alegre**, is located in the northeastern part of the state, near the coast, and serves as a major economic and cultural center.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Rio Grande do Sul is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, rivers, and coastal plains. The state can be divided into three main regions: the **Serra do Mar** mountain range, the **Pampas** region, and the coastal plain. The Serra do Mar mountain range runs along the eastern coast of the state, with peaks reaching elevations of over 1,000 meters. The Pampas region, which covers most of the state, is a vast grassland area with rolling hills and few trees. The coastal plain, which borders the Atlantic Ocean, is a narrow strip of land with sandy beaches, dunes, and lagoons.

The state's landscape is also marked by several major rivers, including the **Uruguay River**, which forms the border with Argentina and Uruguay, and the **Jacuí River**, which flows through the state and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The rivers have played a crucial role in shaping the state's geography and have provided a source of water, transportation, and food for the local population. The diverse landscape of Rio Grande do Sul supports a wide range of flora and fauna, including **subtropical forests**, **grasslands**, and **wetlands**.

The state's coastline is also notable for its beauty and diversity, with over 600 kilometers of beaches, bays, and islands. The coastal area is home to several major ports, including the **Port of Rio Grande**, which is one of the busiest ports in Brazil. The coastline is also an important breeding ground for several species of sea turtles and is home to a variety of marine life, including **dolphins**, **whales**, and **sea birds**.
