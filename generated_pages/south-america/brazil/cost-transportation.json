In general, the quality of public transit is good in major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with a comprehensive network of buses, metro lines, and commuter trains. However, in smaller towns and rural areas, public transportation options may be limited, and **private vehicles** or **taxis** may be the primary mode of transportation. Most people in Brazil get around using a combination of public transportation and ride-hailing services, with many also relying on their own vehicles for personal transportation.\n\nThe transportation infrastructure in Brazil is constantly evolving, with new metro lines and bus systems being developed in major cities. However, traffic congestion is a significant issue in many urban areas, and **traffic jams** can be a major problem during peak hours. Despite these challenges, Brazil has made significant investments in its transportation infrastructure in recent years, and the country is now home to a number of modern and efficient transportation systems.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.50 | $20-$30 | Comprehensive coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | $1.00-$2.00 | $30-$50 | Available in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other major cities |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$3.00 | N/A | Limited routes, often used for shorter distances |\n| Commuter Train | $1.50-$3.00 | $50-$100 | Available in some major cities, limited routes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.00-$5.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$15.00 | Available in most cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00-$5.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$15.00 | 99, Uber, Cabify available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20.00-$50.00 | To city center, prices vary depending on location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Prices vary depending on location and type of fuel |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00-$1.30 | Prices vary depending on location and type of fuel |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-$60 | Economy car, prices vary depending on location and rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2.00-$5.00 | Prices vary depending on location and parking facility |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5.00-$10.00 | Prices vary depending on location and distance traveled |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$50 | Prices vary depending on route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$200 | Prices vary depending on route and airline |\n| Train (long-distance) | $50-$100 | Limited routes, often used for tourist journeys |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like 99, Uber, or Cabify to get around cities, as they are often cheaper and more convenient than taxis.\n- Consider purchasing a **monthly transit pass** for public transportation, as it can be a cost-effective option for frequent travelers.\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** in major cities, and plan your journey accordingly to avoid peak hours.\n- Always **negotiate taxi fares** before starting your journey, as prices can vary depending on the driver and route.\n- Use **cash** when taking taxis or buses, as not all drivers or operators may accept credit or debit cards.\n- Consider **renting a car** for longer journeys or intercity travel, as it can be a more cost-effective option than taking buses or trains.",
