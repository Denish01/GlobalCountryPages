[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nBrazil has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa in advance or can obtain one upon arrival. Citizens of over 90 countries can enter Brazil without a visa, including those from the European Union, the United States, Canada, and Australia. However, the length of stay and requirements may vary depending on the nationality and purpose of the visit. Brazil's visa policy aims to promote tourism, business, and cultural exchange while ensuring national security and public safety.\n\nThe Brazilian government has been working to simplify and streamline its visa process, introducing the **eVisa** system for citizens of certain countries, including the United States, Australia, and Japan. This system allows travelers to apply for a visa online and receive it via email, reducing the need for in-person applications and wait times. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements and regulations can change frequently, so it is crucial to check with the official embassy or consulate of Brazil for the most up-to-date information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter Brazil without a visa for tourism or business purposes |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter Brazil without a visa for tourism or business purposes |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter Brazil without a visa for tourism or business purposes |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter Brazil without a visa for tourism or business purposes |\n| Australian Citizens | No | eVisa | 90 days | Can apply for an eVisa online for tourism or business purposes |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 90 days | Must apply for a visa in advance at a Brazilian embassy or consulate |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 90 days | Must apply for a visa in advance at a Brazilian embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Brazil without a visa for up to 90 days, depending on their nationality.
