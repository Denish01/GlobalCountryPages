[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in Suriname is the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport, located in Paramaribo, which receives flights from major hubs such as Amsterdam, Miami, and Panama City. You can also enter Suriname by land from neighboring countries, including Guyana, Brazil, and French Guiana, with the most common overland entry point being the border crossing at Albina, which connects Suriname to French Guiana. There are also river crossings available from Brazil and Guyana, but these may require more planning and time.

If you're planning to visit Suriname from within South America, you can take a bus or drive from neighboring countries, but be sure to research the necessary visa requirements and border crossing procedures in advance. The bus ride from Georgetown, Guyana, to Paramaribo, Suriname, takes around 6-8 hours, depending on the road conditions and the number of stops along the way. You can also take a ferry from Guyana to Suriname, but this option is less frequent and may not be as convenient.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Suriname has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting Paramaribo to smaller towns and villages in the interior, such as Albina, Bitagron, and Lawa Tabiki. The main domestic airline is Blue Wing Airlines, which operates small propeller planes to these destinations. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as the number of flights is limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 USD per person, depending on the route and the time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Suriname has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. This is due to the country's historical development and geography, with many areas being inaccessible by rail. As a result, other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, are more commonly used.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are several bus companies that operate in Suriname, offering intercity services between Paramaribo and other towns and villages. The buses are generally in good condition, but the road quality can be poor, especially during the rainy season. The cost of a bus ride ranges from $5 to $20 USD, depending on the distance and the type of bus. Some popular bus companies include **Germans Bus** and **Koenders Bus**, which operate daily services to destinations such as Lelydorp, Brokopondo, and Coronie.
