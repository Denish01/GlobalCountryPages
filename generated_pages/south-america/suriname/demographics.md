[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Suriname is relatively small, with approximately 616,500 people, which is roughly equivalent to 0.01% of the South American population. The country's population growth rate is approximately 0.9%, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The population is primarily urban, with around 66.4% of the population living in cities, with the majority residing in the capital city of Paramaribo. The urban population is growing at a faster rate than the rural population, with many people migrating to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Migration patterns in Suriname are also influenced by the country's borders with Guyana, Brazil, and French Guiana, with many people moving to and from these countries for work, education, or family reasons.

The population size and growth trends in Suriname have significant implications for the country's economy, education system, and healthcare services. The relatively low population growth rate and high urbanization rate mean that the country needs to invest in education and job creation to support the growing urban population. Additionally, the country's migration patterns and urbanization trends have led to the development of a diverse and multicultural society, with many different ethnic groups and languages represented.

The country's population is also affected by external factors, such as economic conditions in neighboring countries and global trends. For example, the economic downturn in neighboring countries can lead to an increase in migration to Suriname, while global trends such as climate change can have a significant impact on the country's agriculture and natural resources. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective policies to support the population and promote sustainable development.
