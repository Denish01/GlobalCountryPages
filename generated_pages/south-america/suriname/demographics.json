The country's population growth rate is approximately 0.9%, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The population is primarily urban, with around 66.4% of the population living in cities, with the majority residing in the capital city of Paramaribo. The urban population is growing at a faster rate than the rural population, with many people migrating to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Migration patterns in Suriname are also influenced by the country's borders with Guyana, Brazil, and French Guiana, with many people moving to and from these countries for work, education, or family reasons.\n\nThe population size and growth trends in Suriname have significant implications for the country's economy, education system, and healthcare services. The relatively low population growth rate and high urbanization rate mean that the country needs to invest in education and job creation to support the growing urban population. Additionally, the country's migration patterns and urbanization trends have led to the development of a diverse and multicultural society, with many different ethnic groups and languages represented.\n\nThe country's population is also affected by external factors, such as economic conditions in neighboring countries and global trends. For example, the economic downturn in neighboring countries can lead to an increase in migration to Suriname, while global trends such as climate change can have a significant impact on the country's agriculture and natural resources. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective policies to support the population and promote sustainable development.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hindustani | 27.4% | Urban and rural areas | Descendants of Indian indentured laborers |\n| Maroons | 21.7% | Interior and coastal areas | Descendants of African slaves who escaped into the interior |\n| Creoles | 15.7% | Urban areas | Mixed African and European ancestry |\n| Javanese | 13.7% | Urban and rural areas | Descendants of Indonesian laborers |\n| Indigenous | 3.7% | Interior and coastal areas | Includes various tribes such as the Saramaccan and Arawak |\n| Chinese | 2.5% | Urban areas | Descendants of Chinese laborers and traders |\n| Europeans | 1.5% | Urban areas | Mostly of Dutch and British ancestry |\n| Others | 4.8% | Urban and rural areas | Includes various other ethnic groups |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity in Suriname is a result of the country's history as a colonial trading hub, with people from various parts of the world arriving as laborers, traders, or slaves.
