# Suriname Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Suriname is relatively underdeveloped, with a mix of modern and outdated facilities, particularly in the areas of roads, power, and water supply, which vary significantly between urban and rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 85% of population
Internet Penetration: 55%
Road Network: 4,304 km, mostly unpaved and in moderate condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Suriname's infrastructure development level is considered to be in the mid-range, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and reliable electricity. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on expanding access to essential services and promoting economic development in rural areas. Despite these efforts, Suriname's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including a lack of investment in maintenance and upgrades, which can lead to frequent power outages and disruptions to transportation and communication services.

The country's infrastructure development has been influenced by its **colonial history**, with many of its roads, bridges, and buildings dating back to the Dutch colonial era. In recent years, the government has sought to modernize and expand its infrastructure, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth. However, the country's **geography**, which includes dense rainforests and numerous rivers, can make it difficult and expensive to build and maintain infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.

The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a **national infrastructure plan**, which aims to guide investments in the sector over the next decade. The plan prioritizes investments in transportation, energy, and telecommunications, with a focus on promoting economic growth and improving living standards.
