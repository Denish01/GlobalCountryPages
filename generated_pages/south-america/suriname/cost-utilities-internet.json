  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Suriname can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($60 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($20 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: SRD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Suriname is relatively well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher costs during the dry season (September to November) and lower costs during the rainy season (December to August). The inflation rate in Suriname is relatively high, at 16.2% in 2024, which can also impact the cost of utilities. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, such as subsidies for low-income households.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Suriname is generally good, with most households having access to reliable electricity and water supply. However, there can be occasional power outages and water shortages, particularly during periods of high demand. The cost of utilities is also affected by the country's reliance on imported fuel, which can lead to price volatility. To mitigate this, the government has invested in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in rent) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$230** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-50 | 10 Mbps | Telesur, Digicel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $60-100 | 60 Mbps | Telesur, Digicel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Digicel, Telesur |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10 GB | Digicel, Telesur |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Telesur, Digicel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (Suriname-based streaming services) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as Telesur for electricity and water, and Digicel for internet and mobile services.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a cost-effective option for households with low energy usage, while postpaid plans may be more suitable for households with high energy usage.\n- The best internet providers in Suriname are Telesur and Digicel, which offer a range of plans to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or carpooling to reduce fuel consumption.\n- It is also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure that households are getting the best value for their money.",
