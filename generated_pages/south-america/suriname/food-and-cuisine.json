The **Maroons**, descendants of African slaves who escaped into the interior, have had a significant impact on the country's cuisine, introducing dishes like **Moksie Aleisi**, a traditional Maroon stew. The **Hindustani** and **Javanese** communities have also contributed to the country's culinary diversity, introducing dishes like **Roti** and **Nasi Goreng**.\n\nThe cuisine in Suriname is characterized by the use of fresh ingredients, spices, and a variety of cooking techniques. The country's cuisine is also shaped by its history, with many dishes reflecting the cultural exchange between different groups. For example, the **Chinese** community has introduced dishes like **Loempia**, a Surinamese version of the Chinese spring roll. The **Indigenous** community has also contributed to the country's cuisine, introducing dishes like **Kasu Marai**, a traditional indigenous stew made with **kasu** (a type of fish) and **marai** (a type of leaf).\n\nRegional variations in Suriname's cuisine are also notable, with different regions having their own unique dishes and specialties.
