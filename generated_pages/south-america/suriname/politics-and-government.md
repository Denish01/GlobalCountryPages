[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Suriname is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is elected by the National Assembly for a five-year term. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral National Assembly with 51 seats, where members are elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of a Court of Justice and a Court of Appeal.

The system of government in Suriname is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the three branches, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and powers. The National Assembly has the power to pass laws, approve the budget, and exercise parliamentary control over the government. The President has the power to appoint ministers, ambassadors, and other high-ranking officials, as well as to sign bills into law. The judiciary has the power to interpret laws and resolve disputes.

The government of Suriname is also characterized by a **unitary system**, where the central government has the majority of the power and the regions have limited autonomy. This means that the central government is responsible for most areas of policy, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
