[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Suriname is divided into three main levels: **primary education**, **secondary education**, and **tertiary education**. Primary education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, and is provided by both public and private schools. Secondary education is also compulsory, and is typically attended by students between the ages of 12 and 18. Tertiary education, which includes universities and colleges, is not compulsory, but is highly valued and sought after by many students. The quality of education in Suriname is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and intellectual development.

The education system in Suriname is overseen by the **Ministry of Education and Community Development**, which is responsible for setting educational policies and standards, as well as providing funding and support to schools and institutions. Public schools are free and open to all students, while private schools are fee-based and often have selective admissions. Despite the many strengths of the education system in Suriname, there are also some challenges, including a lack of resources and infrastructure in some areas, as well as a shortage of qualified teachers in certain subjects.

In recent years, the government of Suriname has made significant efforts to improve the quality and accessibility of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods, as well as investments in school infrastructure and technology. These efforts have helped to make education more inclusive and effective, and have contributed to the country's high literacy rate and strong academic achievement.
