  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Suriname can vary significantly depending on whether you opt for public or private services, with the average health expenditure per capita being $297.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $297 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 19.7% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: SRD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSuriname has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private sector, with limited resources and longer waiting times. Locals often rely on the public system, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a referral basis, where patients need to see a general practitioner before being referred to a specialist. It is recommended to have insurance to cover medical expenses, especially for foreigners, as the cost of healthcare can be high.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Suriname varies significantly between public and private providers. Public hospitals and clinics are generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer higher quality care, with more modern equipment and better-trained staff. However, these services come at a higher cost, making them less accessible to the general population. For foreigners, it is often recommended to opt for private healthcare, as the quality of care is generally better and more tailored to international standards.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$250 | Prices vary by specialty and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | Prices vary by dentist and location |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$100 | Prices vary by optometrist and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$100 | Prices vary by lab and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers a wide range of medical expenses, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical expenses worldwide, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at pharmacies, but may require a doctor's prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may not always be of the same quality as those found in other countries.\n- The cost of medications can vary significantly, with prices ranging from $5 to $50 or more per prescription.\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n- It is recommended to check the expiration dates and packaging of medications before purchasing.\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not always have the latest or most advanced medications available.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112 or visit the nearest hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally the private hospitals, which offer higher quality care and more modern equipment. However, these hospitals may not always be available or accessible, especially in rural areas. It is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of transportation available.\n\nAmbulance services are available in Suriname, but may not always be reliable or efficient. In some cases, it may be faster and more effective to take a taxi or private vehicle to the hospital. It is also recommended to have a basic first aid kit and knowledge of basic first aid techniques, as medical help may not always be immediately available. For foreigners, it is especially important to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of communication available.
