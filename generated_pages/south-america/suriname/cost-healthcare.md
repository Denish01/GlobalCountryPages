[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Suriname has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private sector, with limited resources and longer waiting times. Locals often rely on the public system, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a referral basis, where patients need to see a general practitioner before being referred to a specialist. It is recommended to have insurance to cover medical expenses, especially for foreigners, as the cost of healthcare can be high.

The quality of healthcare in Suriname varies significantly between public and private providers. Public hospitals and clinics are generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer higher quality care, with more modern equipment and better-trained staff. However, these services come at a higher cost, making them less accessible to the general population. For foreigners, it is often recommended to opt for private healthcare, as the quality of care is generally better and more tailored to international standards.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 112 or visit the nearest hospital. The best hospitals for foreigners are generally the private hospitals, which offer higher quality care and more modern equipment. However, these hospitals may not always be available or accessible, especially in rural areas. It is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of transportation available.

Ambulance services are available in Suriname, but may not always be reliable or efficient. In some cases, it may be faster and more effective to take a taxi or private vehicle to the hospital. It is also recommended to have a basic first aid kit and knowledge of basic first aid techniques, as medical help may not always be immediately available. For foreigners, it is especially important to have a plan in place for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of communication available. [CALLOUT] It is also recommended to research and purchase travel insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations and repatriations, in case of a serious medical emergency.
