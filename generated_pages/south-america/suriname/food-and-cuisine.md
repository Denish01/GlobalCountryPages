The **Maroons**, descendants of African slaves who escaped into the interior, have had a significant impact on the country's cuisine, introducing dishes like **Moksie Aleisi**, a traditional Maroon stew. The **Hindustani** and **Javanese** communities have also contributed to the country's culinary diversity, introducing dishes like **Roti** and **Nasi Goreng**.

The cuisine in Suriname is characterized by the use of fresh ingredients, spices, and a variety of cooking techniques. The country's cuisine is also shaped by its history, with many dishes reflecting the cultural exchange between different groups.

The **Indigenous** community has also contributed to the country's cuisine, introducing dishes like **Kasu Marai**, a traditional indigenous stew made with **kasu** (a type of fish) and **marai** (a type of leaf).
