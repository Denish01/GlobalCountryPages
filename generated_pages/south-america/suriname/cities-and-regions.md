[SECTION] How Suriname Is Divided [/SECTION]
Suriname's administrative structure is divided into ten districts, each governed by a district commissioner who is appointed by the central government. These districts are further subdivided into resorts, which are the basic units of local government. The districts are: Brokopondo, Commewijne, Coronie, Marowijne, Nickerie, Para, Paramaribo, Saramacca, Sipaliwini, and Wanica. This division allows for a decentralized approach to governance, enabling local authorities to address regional issues and provide services tailored to the specific needs of their communities.

The districts vary greatly in terms of population density, economic activity, and cultural influences. For instance, the Paramaribo district is the most populous and serves as the country's economic and cultural hub, while the Sipaliwini district is the largest in terms of area but has a relatively small population. Understanding these divisions is essential for grasping the complexities of Suriname's geography, economy, and society.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Suriname has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, buses, and taxis connecting the major cities and towns. The country's road network is extensive, but driving conditions can be challenging, especially in the interior regions. The main airport, Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport, is located near Paramaribo and offers flights to major destinations in the region. Bus services are frequent and affordable, while taxis are widely available but may require negotiation of fares. For travelers seeking to explore the interior, renting a 4x4 vehicle or hiring a local guide is recommended due to the rough terrain and limited infrastructure.

Domestic flights are available to some of the more remote areas, such as the Sipaliwini district, but these services may be limited and subject to weather conditions. The country's rail network is non-existent, making road transportation the primary means of getting around. Despite these challenges, Suriname's unique cultural and natural attractions make it a rewarding destination for adventurous travelers willing to explore its diverse regions and cities. [CALLOUT] Be sure to plan carefully and research transportation options in advance to ensure a smooth and enjoyable journey.
