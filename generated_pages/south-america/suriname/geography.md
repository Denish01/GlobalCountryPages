[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Suriname is situated in the northern part of South America, with a total area of approximately 163,820 square kilometers. The country is bordered by three countries: Guyana to the west, Brazil to the south, and French Guiana to the east. The Atlantic Ocean lies to the north of Suriname, providing a coastline of 386 kilometers. The country's strategic location allows it to serve as a bridge between the Caribbean and South America. The borders of Suriname are largely defined by natural features, including the Courantyne River to the west and the Marowijne River to the east.

The location of Suriname has played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture. The country's proximity to the equator and its location in the tropics have created a unique environment that supports a wide range of flora and fauna. The coastal region of Suriname is characterized by a mixture of sandy beaches, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes, while the interior of the country is dominated by dense rainforests and savannas. The country's borders have also been influenced by its colonial history, with the Dutch, British, and French all having played a role in shaping the country's boundaries.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Suriname is characterized by a mix of coastal plains, savannas, and dense rainforests. The coastal region is relatively flat, with a mixture of sandy beaches, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. The interior of the country is dominated by the Guiana Shield, a region of Precambrian rock that stretches across northern South America. The Guiana Shield is home to a number of significant mountain ranges, including the Wilhelmina Mountains and the Emmaketen Mountains. The highest point in Suriname is Julianatop, which is located in the Wilhelmina Mountains and has an elevation of 1,280 meters.

The landscape of Suriname is also characterized by a number of significant rivers, including the Courantyne River, the Marowijne River, and the Saramacca River. These rivers play a crucial role in shaping the country's terrain and supporting its flora and fauna. The rivers are also an important source of transportation and commerce, with many communities located along their banks. The interior of the country is also home to a number of significant waterfalls, including the **Kaieteur Falls**, which is one of the largest waterfalls in the world by volume.

The rainforests of Suriname are some of the most pristine and untouched in the world. The country is home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including many species that are found nowhere else in the world. The rainforests are also an important source of timber and other forest products, with many communities relying on the forest for their livelihood. The government of Suriname has established a number of protected areas, including national parks and wildlife reserves, to conserve the country's natural resources and protect its biodiversity.
