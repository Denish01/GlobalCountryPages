  "content": "Suriname is generally cheaper than French Guiana, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nSuriname GDP per Capita (PPP): 13,445\nFrench Guiana GDP per Capita (PPP): 26,439\nSuriname Inflation Rate: 4.5%\nFrench Guiana Inflation Rate: 1.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Suriname\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Suriname vs French Guiana [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Suriname and French Guiana varies significantly, despite both countries being located in South America. Suriname has a lower cost of living, with affordable housing, food, and transportation options. The country's economy is driven by the export of aluminum, gold, and oil, which has contributed to its relatively stable economic growth. In contrast, French Guiana has a higher cost of living, mainly due to its status as an overseas department of France, which means that it is subject to French economic policies and prices. As a result, French Guiana has a more developed economy, with a higher GDP per capita, but also higher prices for goods and services.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Suriname's economy is more focused on natural resource extraction, which has led to a relatively low cost of living. On the other hand, French Guiana's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on services and industry, which has driven up prices. Overall, Suriname is a more affordable option for those looking to live in South America, with a cost of living that is around 20-30% lower than French Guiana. However, French Guiana offers a more developed infrastructure and a higher standard of living, which may be attractive to some individuals.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Suriname (USD) | French Guiana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 700 | 42% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 450 | 44% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 700 | 1,200 | 42% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Suriname (USD) | French Guiana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 500 | 40% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Suriname (USD) | French Guiana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Suriname (USD) | French Guiana (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Suriname (USD) | French Guiana (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Suriname is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with options available for 40-50% less than in French Guiana\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries available for 30-40% less than in French Guiana\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices 30-50% lower than in French Guiana\n  - Utilities and internet, with options available for 30-40% less than in French Guiana\n- **French Guiana is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end goods and services, such as luxury cars and designer clothing\n  - International travel, with more frequent flights and better connections to Europe and other parts of the world\n  - Education, with access to French universities and schools\n  - Healthcare, with access to high-quality medical facilities and specialists\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nSuriname and French Guiana offer different value propositions for different lifestyles.
