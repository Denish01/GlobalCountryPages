[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Suriname is relatively well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher costs during the dry season (September to November) and lower costs during the rainy season (December to August). The inflation rate in Suriname is relatively high, at 16.2% in 2024, which can also impact the cost of utilities. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, such as subsidies for low-income households.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Suriname is generally good, with most households having access to reliable electricity and water supply. However, there can be occasional power outages and water shortages, particularly during periods of high demand. The cost of utilities is also affected by the country's reliance on imported fuel, which can lead to price volatility. To mitigate this, the government has invested in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
