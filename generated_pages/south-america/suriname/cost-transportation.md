[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
In Suriname, the primary modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and private cars. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with buses and taxis readily available in urban areas. However, the public transportation system can be limited in rural areas, making private cars a more convenient option for those who can afford them. Most people in Suriname get around by using buses or taxis, which are relatively affordable and widely available.

The road network in Suriname is relatively well-developed, with paved roads connecting major cities and towns. However, the condition of roads can vary, especially during the rainy season. Additionally, traffic congestion can be a problem in urban areas, particularly in the capital city of Paramaribo. Despite these challenges, Suriname has a relatively well-organized public transportation system, with buses and taxis operating on fixed routes and schedules.
