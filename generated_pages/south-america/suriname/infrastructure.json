  "content": "The infrastructure in Suriname is relatively underdeveloped, with a mix of modern and outdated facilities, particularly in the areas of roads, power, and water supply, which vary significantly between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 85% of population\nInternet Penetration: 55%\nRoad Network: 4,304 km, mostly unpaved and in moderate condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSuriname's infrastructure development level is considered to be in the mid-range, with significant investments made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors. However, the urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and reliable electricity. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on expanding access to essential services and promoting economic development in rural areas. Despite these efforts, Suriname's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including a lack of investment in maintenance and upgrades, which can lead to frequent power outages and disruptions to transportation and communication services.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development has been influenced by its **colonial history**, with many of its roads, bridges, and buildings dating back to the Dutch colonial era. In recent years, the government has sought to modernize and expand its infrastructure, with a focus on attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth. However, the country's **geography**, which includes dense rainforests and numerous rivers, can make it difficult and expensive to build and maintain infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe government has implemented various initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the development of a **national infrastructure plan**, which aims to guide investments in the sector over the next decade. The plan prioritizes investments in transportation, energy, and telecommunications, with a focus on promoting economic growth and improving living standards.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 4,304 km | Moderate | mostly unpaved, with some paved highways connecting major cities |\n| Railways | none | - | no rail network exists in Suriname |\n| Airports | 3 international, 4 domestic | Good | major airports include Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport and Zorg en Hoop Airport |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | major ports include the Port of Paramaribo and the Port of Albina |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The majority of Suriname's power generation comes from **hydroelectric sources**, with the Afobaka Dam being the largest source of electricity.\n- The country's power grid is relatively reliable, but **power outages** can occur, particularly during periods of high demand or maintenance.\n- Suriname has made progress in increasing its use of **renewable energy sources**, including solar and wind power, with a goal of reducing its dependence on fossil fuels.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve the efficiency and reliability of the power grid, including the installation of new transmission lines and substations.\n- However, the country still faces challenges in terms of **energy access**, particularly in rural areas, where many households rely on **generators** or other forms of off-grid power.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally considered safe to drink in urban areas, but its quality can vary in rural areas, where many households rely on **well water** or **rainwater collection**.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high in urban areas, but can be limited in rural areas, where many households lack access to **sewerage systems**.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve access to **clean water** and **sanitation**, particularly in rural areas, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sanitation facilities.\n- However, the country still faces challenges in terms of **water management**, including the need to improve the efficiency and sustainability of its water resources.\n- **Flooding** can be a significant problem in Suriname, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall, and the government has implemented initiatives to improve its **flood protection** measures.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread in Suriname, with most areas having access to **2G** or **3G** networks.\n- The country has made progress in expanding its **fiber-optic network**, with a goal of improving **broadband** access and reducing **internet costs**.\n- **4G** networks are available in some areas, particularly in urban centers, but coverage can be limited in rural areas.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **telecommunications** services, including the installation of new cell towers and the expansion of fiber-optic networks.\n- **Postal services** are available in Suriname, but can be limited in rural areas, where many households rely on **private courier services**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a **major road expansion project**, which aims to improve the country's road network and reduce **travel times**.\n- Suriname is also investing in the development of its **energy sector**, including the construction of new **hydroelectric dams** and **solar farms**.\n- The country has received funding from international organizations, including the **Inter-American Development Bank**, to support its infrastructure development projects.\n- The government has implemented initiatives to improve **water management**, including the construction of new **water treatment plants** and **flood protection** measures.\n- However, the country still faces challenges in terms of **funding**, and the government has sought to attract **foreign investment** to support its infrastructure development projects.",
