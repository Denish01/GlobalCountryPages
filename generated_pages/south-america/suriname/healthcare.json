  "content": "Healthcare in Suriname is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services, although the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Suriname is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of care for most citizens. The public system is funded by the government and provides a range of services, including primary care, hospital care, and specialized services. However, the quality of care in the public system can be inconsistent, with some facilities being better equipped and staffed than others. In contrast, the private system offers higher-quality care, but is generally more expensive and may not be accessible to all citizens. Urban areas, such as the capital city of Paramaribo, tend to have better access to healthcare services than rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be scarce.\n\nThe quality of care in Suriname is generally considered to be good, with many healthcare professionals being well-trained and experienced. However, there are some challenges, including a shortage of certain medical specialties and a lack of access to certain types of care, such as mental health services. Additionally, the healthcare system in Suriname is not always well-integrated, with different providers and facilities often operating independently of one another. This can make it difficult for patients to navigate the system and receive comprehensive care.\n\nDespite these challenges, Suriname has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system. The government has invested in new facilities and equipment, and has implemented programs to improve the quality of care and increase access to services. Additionally, many international organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are working in Suriname to support the healthcare system and provide additional services and resources.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academic Hospital Paramaribo | Paramaribo | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Diakonessenhuis | Paramaribo | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| 's Lands Hospital | Nieuw Nickerie | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Medisch Centrum Suriname | Paramaribo | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Sint Vincentius Hospital | Paramaribo | Private | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Yes |\n| Regional Hospital Saramacca | Groningen | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency care | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all citizens and visitors, as it can provide access to higher-quality care and help cover the cost of medical expenses.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including companies such as SVB and GOP, which offer a range of plans and coverage options.\n- **Expats and foreigners** may be required to have health insurance as a condition of their visa or residency permit.\n- **Costs** can vary widely depending on the type of insurance and the level of coverage, but basic plans can start at around SRD 500 per month.\n- **International insurance** is also available, and may be a good option for those who plan to travel frequently or live in multiple countries.\n- **Government-sponsored insurance** is available for certain groups, such as low-income citizens and children, but may have limited coverage and benefits.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Suriname, with many pharmacies and drugstores located throughout the country.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but many common medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** include international companies such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, as well as local and regional brands.\n- **Costs** can vary depending on the type and brand of medication, but many common medications are relatively affordable.\n- **Availability** of certain medications, such as those for chronic conditions or specialty care, may be limited in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever** vaccination is required for all travelers entering Suriname from certain countries, and is recommended for all travelers who plan to spend time in rural areas.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Suriname, particularly in the interior and border regions, and travelers should take precautions to prevent infection.\n- **Dengue fever** and **chikungunya** are also present in Suriname, and travelers should take precautions to prevent infection, such as using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing.\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers, as these diseases can be present in Suriname.\n- **Rabies** is present in some animals in Suriname, and travelers should take precautions to avoid animal bites and scratches.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Suriname, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water and use caution when swimming in rivers and lakes.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Suriname** is not a major destination for medical tourism, but some patients may travel to the country for certain procedures, such as **cosmetic surgery** or **dental care**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Academic Hospital Paramaribo and the Medisch Centrum Suriname, which offer a range of medical services and procedures.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for certain procedures, particularly when compared to prices in the United States or Europe.\n- **Language** may be a barrier for some medical tourists, as not all healthcare providers speak English fluently.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **In an emergency**, travelers should call 112 or go to the nearest hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can vary depending on the location and time of day, but most major hospitals have emergency services available.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found in major cities such as Paramaribo and Nieuw Nickerie, and in some rural areas.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed as soon as possible after an emergency, and travelers should keep all receipts and documentation related to their medical care.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, particularly if the patient requires specialized care or treatment that is not available in Suriname.",
