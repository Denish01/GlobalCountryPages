[SECTION] Overview: Suriname vs French Guiana [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Suriname and French Guiana varies significantly, despite both countries being located in South America. Suriname has a lower cost of living, with affordable housing, food, and transportation options. The country's economy is driven by the export of aluminum, gold, and oil, which has contributed to its relatively stable economic growth. In contrast, French Guiana has a higher cost of living, mainly due to its status as an overseas department of France, which means that it is subject to French economic policies and prices. As a result, French Guiana has a more developed economy, with a higher GDP per capita, but also higher prices for goods and services.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Suriname's economy is more focused on natural resource extraction, which has led to a relatively low cost of living. On the other hand, French Guiana's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on services and industry, which has driven up prices. Overall, Suriname is a more affordable option for those looking to live in South America, with a cost of living that is around 20-30% lower than French Guiana. However, French Guiana offers a more developed infrastructure and a higher standard of living, which may be attractive to some individuals.
