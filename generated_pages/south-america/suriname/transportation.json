  "content": "To get around in Suriname, you can use a combination of domestic flights, buses, taxis, and rental cars, as the country has a limited rail network and no metro system. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport (PBM)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe main international airport in Suriname is the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport, located in Paramaribo, which receives flights from major hubs such as Amsterdam, Miami, and Panama City. You can also enter Suriname by land from neighboring countries, including Guyana, Brazil, and French Guiana, with the most common overland entry point being the border crossing at Albina, which connects Suriname to French Guiana. There are also river crossings available from Brazil and Guyana, but these may require more planning and time.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Suriname from within South America, you can take a bus or drive from neighboring countries, but be sure to research the necessary visa requirements and border crossing procedures in advance. The bus ride from Georgetown, Guyana, to Paramaribo, Suriname, takes around 6-8 hours, depending on the road conditions and the number of stops along the way. You can also take a ferry from Guyana to Suriname, but this option is less frequent and may not be as convenient.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nSuriname has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting Paramaribo to smaller towns and villages in the interior, such as Albina, Bitagron, and Lawa Tabiki. The main domestic airline is Blue Wing Airlines, which operates small propeller planes to these destinations. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as the number of flights is limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 USD per person, depending on the route and the time of year.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nSuriname has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. This is due to the country's historical development and geography, with many areas being inaccessible by rail. As a result, other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars, are more commonly used.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThere are several bus companies that operate in Suriname, offering intercity services between Paramaribo and other towns and villages. The buses are generally in good condition, but the road quality can be poor, especially during the rainy season. The cost of a bus ride ranges from $5 to $20 USD, depending on the distance and the type of bus. Some popular bus companies include **Germans Bus** and **Koenders Bus**, which operate daily services to destinations such as Lelydorp, Brokopondo, and Coronie.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Paramaribo, Lelydorp | $1-$2 | Frequent services, but can be crowded |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10/km | Available at taxi stands or by phone |\n| Ride-Hailing | Paramaribo | $5-$10 | Local alternatives, such as **Spartaxi** |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Not available | - | Not a common mode of transport in Suriname |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Suriname, you'll need a valid driver's license from your home country, as well as a **car insurance** policy that covers you in Suriname.\n- The road quality in Suriname can be poor, especially on rural roads, so it's essential to drive carefully and slowly.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high in Suriname, with gasoline prices ranging from $1 to $2 USD per liter.\n- Car rental companies, such as **Avis** and **Hertz**, are available at the international airport and in Paramaribo, but be sure to research and book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n- When driving in Suriname, be aware of potential hazards such as **potholes**, **speed bumps**, and **aggressive driving**.\n- It's also a good idea to learn some basic **Dutch phrases**, as not everyone speaks English, especially outside of Paramaribo.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be cautious when using taxis, as some drivers may try to overcharge tourists, so it's a good idea to agree on a price before you start your journey.\n- When taking a bus, be prepared for **crowds** and **delays**, especially during peak hours.\n- Download the **Spartaxi** app to book a ride-hailing service in Paramaribo.\n- Always wear a **seatbelt** when driving or riding in a car, as road safety laws are strictly enforced in Suriname.\n- Be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas, to avoid **pickpocketing** or **scams**.\n- Research the **weather forecast** before traveling to Suriname, as the rainy season can cause **flooding** and **road closures**.\n- Consider hiring a **local guide** or joining a **tour group** to explore the country's interior, as some areas can be difficult to access without knowledge of the local terrain and culture.",
