**Students:** Students must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment at a Surinamese educational institution, a valid passport, and sufficient funds. The duration of the student visa is typically one year, and it can be extended for the duration of the study program. Students must also provide proof of health insurance and a police certificate of good conduct.
**Workers:** Workers must apply for a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a Surinamese employer, a valid passport, and sufficient funds.
