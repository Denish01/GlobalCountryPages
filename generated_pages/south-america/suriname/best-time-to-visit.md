[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Suriname has a tropical rainforest climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which typically runs from August to November and from February to April, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C. During this time, the humidity is relatively low, making it an ideal period for outdoor activities such as hiking, birdwatching, and exploring the country's many nature reserves. The wet season, which runs from May to July and from December to January, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it more challenging to engage in outdoor activities.

The seasons in Suriname have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's many national parks and nature reserves. The wet season, on the other hand, can make some areas inaccessible due to flooding, and the heavy rainfall can make outdoor activities more challenging. However, the wet season is also a great time to see the country's waterfalls and rivers in full flow, and to spot a variety of wildlife, including monkeys, sloths, and toucans.

Suriname's climate is also influenced by its location near the equator, which means that the country experiences a relatively constant amount of daylight throughout the year. The average temperature in Suriname ranges from 22°C to 30°C, making it a warm and humid country year-round. The coastal regions tend to be cooler than the interior, and the mountains can be cooler than the low-lying areas.
