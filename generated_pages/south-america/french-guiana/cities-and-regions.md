[SECTION] How French Guiana Is Divided [/SECTION]
French Guiana is an overseas department and region of France, and as such, it is divided into two main departments: Guyane and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. However, in 2015, the departments were merged to form a single department, Guyane, which is further divided into 19 communes. The administrative structure of French Guiana is similar to that of other French departments, with a prefect and a general council that oversee the region's affairs. The capital, Cayenne, is the largest city and the economic and cultural center of the territory.

The division of French Guiana into smaller regions and communes allows for more localized governance and decision-making, which is important given the territory's diverse geography and population. From the coastal cities to the interior rainforests, each region of French Guiana has its own unique character and challenges, and the administrative structure is designed to address these differences.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
French Guiana has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with several domestic airports, including the Cayenne-Rochambeau Airport, which offers flights to Paris and other destinations in South America. The territory also has a network of buses and taxis that connect the major cities and towns. However, the road network is limited, and many areas are only accessible by boat or on foot. The territory's rugged terrain and dense rainforests make driving conditions challenging, and visitors are advised to exercise caution when traveling by car.

In addition to domestic flights and buses, French Guiana also has a number of ferry services that connect the coastal cities and towns. The territory's ports, such as the Port of Cayenne and the Port of Kourou, are also important transportation hubs, with cargo ships and cruise liners arriving from around the world. Overall, while getting around French Guiana can be challenging, the territory's unique landscape and culture make it a rewarding destination for adventurous travelers.
