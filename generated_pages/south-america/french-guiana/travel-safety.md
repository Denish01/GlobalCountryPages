French Guiana is a relatively safe territory, with a strong emphasis on security and law enforcement. The capital city, Cayenne, is generally considered safe, with a low crime rate compared to other major cities in South America. However, as with any destination, petty crimes such as pickpocketing and theft can occur, particularly in crowded areas and tourist hotspots.

With its stunning natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and relatively low crime rate, it's an excellent choice for those who want to explore the Amazon rainforest and experience the unique blend of French and Caribbean cultures. However, as with any travel destination, it's essential to take necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip. Visitors should be aware of their surroundings, keep valuables secure, and avoid traveling alone at night, especially in rural areas.
