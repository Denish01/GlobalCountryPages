However, in 2015, the departments were merged to form a single department, Guyane, which is further divided into 19 communes. The administrative structure of French Guiana is similar to that of other French departments, with a prefect and a general council that oversee the region's affairs. The capital, Cayenne, is the largest city and the economic and cultural center of the territory.\n\nThe division of French Guiana into smaller regions and communes allows for more localized governance and decision-making, which is important given the territory's diverse geography and population. From the coastal cities to the interior rainforests, each region of French Guiana has its own unique character and challenges, and the administrative structure is designed to address these differences.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Cayenne** (55,000)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Cayenne is the largest city in French Guiana and is known for its rich history, cultural attractions, and vibrant marketplaces.
