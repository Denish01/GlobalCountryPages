The population growth rate is approximately 2.7% per year, which is higher than the average growth rate in France. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 26 years, and is predominantly urban, with about 85% of the population living in cities. The population density is relatively low, at 3.5 people per km², due to the vast size of the territory. French Guiana's population has been growing steadily over the years, driven by a combination of natural increase and migration. The territory's urbanization rate is high, with many people moving to cities such as Cayenne, the capital, in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of French Guiana is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the territory and from other countries. Many people move to French Guiana from other parts of France, as well as from neighboring countries such as Brazil and Suriname. The territory's economy is driven by a range of industries, including agriculture, forestry, and mining, which attract workers from other parts of the world. The population growth rate and urbanization trends in French Guiana have significant implications for the territory's development, including the need for investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe migration patterns in French Guiana are complex and influenced by a range of factors, including economic opportunities, family ties, and cultural affinity. Many migrants come to French Guiana in search of work, particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors. Others come to join family members or to pursue educational or cultural opportunities.
