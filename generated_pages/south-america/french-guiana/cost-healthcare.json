The system is largely funded by the French government, and residents are required to have health insurance, either through their employer or by purchasing it individually. Public healthcare services are generally of good quality, but may have longer wait times and less availability of specialized care. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, offer more convenience and specialized care, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in French Guiana, as the public system may not cover all expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in French Guiana is generally well-organized, with a network of public hospitals and clinics, as well as private healthcare providers. However, the system can be complex, and foreigners may need to navigate the system with the help of a translator or a healthcare professional. Additionally, some medical specialties may not be available in French Guiana, and patients may need to be evacuated to France or another country for specialized care. It is essential for foreigners to research and understand the healthcare system in French Guiana before moving to the territory, and to consider purchasing private health insurance that covers them in case of an emergency.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | Private specialists may have more availability |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Public dental care may be limited |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public labs may have longer wait times for results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may have more amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Public hospitals may have more limited surgical options |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | Private hospitals may have more advanced neonatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may have more availability |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public clinics may have longer wait times for results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, including specialist consultations and advanced medical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Comprehensive coverage, including evacuation to France or another country for specialized care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally available at public pharmacies, with costs ranging from $5-$20 per prescription\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with costs ranging from $5-$10 per medication\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a doctor, while others may be available without a prescription\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not have all medications available, especially in rural areas\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medications with you when traveling to French Guiana, as they may not be available locally\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 15, which will connect you with emergency services, including ambulance and fire departments.
