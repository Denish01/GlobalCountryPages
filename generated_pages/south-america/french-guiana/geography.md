[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
French Guiana is situated on the northern coast of South America, where the continent meets the Atlantic Ocean. The territory is bounded by Brazil to the south and east, with a border that stretches for over 673 kilometers, and Suriname to the west, with a border of approximately 510 kilometers. To the north, French Guiana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, with a coastline that offers a mix of sandy beaches, rocky shores, and mangrove swamps. The territory's unique location, where the equatorial forest meets the ocean, creates a diverse range of ecosystems and landscapes.

The location of French Guiana has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The territory's proximity to the equator and its tropical climate have made it an attractive location for colonial powers, with France establishing its first settlement in the area in the 17th century. Today, French Guiana remains an overseas department of France, with a distinct cultural identity that reflects its European, African, and indigenous influences. The territory's borders with Brazil and Suriname have also had an impact on its economy, with trade and commerce playing an important role in the region.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
French Guiana's terrain is characterized by a mix of coastal plains, hills, and mountains. The territory's landscape is dominated by the **Guiana Shield**, a Precambrian geological formation that stretches across northern South America. The shield is composed of ancient rocks, including granite, gneiss, and schist, which have been shaped by millions of years of erosion. The resulting landscape is one of rolling hills, valleys, and plateaus, with the highest point being the **Bellevue de l'Inini**, which rises to an elevation of 851 meters.

The coastal plains of French Guiana are narrow and low-lying, with a mix of sandy beaches, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. The **Maroni River**, which forms the border with Suriname, flows through a vast delta that is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including caimans, dolphins, and over 700 species of birds. The interior of the territory is covered by a dense **tropical rainforest**, which is home to a wide range of plant and animal species, including monkeys, sloths, and jaguars. The rainforest is also home to several indigenous communities, who have lived in the area for thousands of years.

The terrain of French Guiana has also been shaped by its geological history, with the territory experiencing a range of geological processes, including volcanic activity, earthquakes, and erosion. The resulting landscape is one of great beauty and diversity, with a range of unique landforms, including **inselbergs**, **waterfalls**, and **canyons**. The territory's terrain has also played a significant role in shaping its economy, with the mining industry being a major contributor to the territory's GDP.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION] 
continued, French Guiana's rivers are also an important feature of its terrain, with several major rivers flowing through the territory. The **Approuague River**, which flows through the center of the territory, is an important transportation route, with cargo boats and passenger ferries using the river to travel to and from the interior. The river is also home to a range of aquatic life, including fish, caimans, and dolphins. The **Oyapock River**, which forms the border with Brazil, is another important river, with a range of unique plant and animal species found only in this region.
