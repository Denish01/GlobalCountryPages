The cuisine is characterized by the use of local ingredients such as cassava, plantains, and fish, which are often combined with French techniques and spices. The coastal region is known for its seafood dishes, while the interior is famous for its game meats and traditional **Amerindian** dishes. The capital city, Cayenne, offers a wide range of restaurants serving both traditional and modern French Guianese cuisine.\n\nThe cuisine in French Guiana is also influenced by the territory's history of colonization and immigration. African slaves brought their own culinary traditions, which were adapted to the local ingredients and cooking techniques. The result is a unique fusion of flavors and dishes that are both familiar and exotic. The territory's cuisine is also shaped by its geographic location, with the Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic Ocean providing a rich source of ingredients and inspiration.\n\nFrench Guiana's food culture is also characterized by its emphasis on community and sharing. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds. The territory's cuisine is also closely tied to its cultural heritage, with many dishes and traditions passed down through generations. Visitors to French Guiana can experience the territory's unique food culture by attending a traditional **Soirée Créole**, where they can sample local dishes and drinks while enjoying live music and dance.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Poulet Boucané | main course | smoked chicken dish with spices and herbs | traditional restaurants in Cayenne |\n| Blaff de Poisson | main course | fish stew with coconut milk and spices | seafood restaurants in Kourou |\n| Calou | side dish | fried plantains with salt and pepper | street food stalls in Cayenne |\n| Riz au Poulet | main course | chicken and rice dish with spices and vegetables | casual restaurants in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni |\n| Bouillon d'Aurora | soup | fish soup with coconut milk and spices | traditional restaurants in Cayenne |\n| Pimentade | main course | pepper pot stew with meat and vegetables | casual restaurants in Kourou |\n| Accras de Morue | appetizer | cod fritters with spices and herbs | seafood restaurants in Cayenne |\n| Tafia | dessert | sugarcane liquor with fruit and spices | local bars and restaurants |\n| Colombo de Porc | main course | pork stew with spices and coconut milk | traditional restaurants in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni |\n| Fricassee de Gibier | main course | game meat stew with spices and herbs | traditional restaurants in Cayenne |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Accras de Morue**: cod fritters with spices and herbs, $5-7 USD\n- **Calou**: fried plantains with salt and pepper, $3-5 USD\n- **Bokit**: fried dough filled with meat or fish, $5-7 USD\n- **Piment**: pepper sauce with spices and herbs, $2-3 USD\n- **Fried Cassava**: fried cassava with salt and pepper, $3-5 USD\n- **Coconut Water**: fresh coconut water with a touch of lime, $2-3 USD\n- **Sugar Cane Juice**: fresh sugar cane juice with a touch of lime, $3-5 USD\n- **Fried Fish**: fried fish with spices and herbs, $5-7 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Tafia**: sugarcane liquor with fruit and spices, $5-7 USD\n- **Rhum**: rum with spices and herbs, $5-7 USD\n- **Coconut Water**: fresh coconut water with a touch of lime, $2-3 USD\n- **Sugar Cane Juice**: fresh sugar cane juice with a touch of lime, $3-5 USD\n- **Fresh Fruit Juice**: fresh fruit juice with a touch of sugar, $3-5 USD\n- **Guiana Beer**: local beer with a crisp taste, $5-7 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Dining is a social occasion, and mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring people together\n- It is customary to greet the host and other diners with a handshake or a kiss on the cheek\n- Table manners are formal, with an emphasis on using utensils and napkins\n- Tipping is expected, with 5-10% of the total bill being the norm\n- Reservations are recommended for popular restaurants, especially on weekends\n- Dress codes are casual, but dressy attire is expected for special occasions\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional Restaurants**: offer a range of local dishes and drinks, with a focus on traditional cuisine\n- **Seafood Restaurants**: offer a range of seafood dishes, with a focus on fresh and locally sourced ingredients\n- **Casual Restaurants**: offer a range of casual dishes, with a focus on comfort food and local flavors\n- **Street Food Stalls**: offer a range of street food and snacks, with a focus on local flavors and ingredients\n- **Local Markets**: offer a range of local produce and handicrafts, with a focus on supporting local farmers and artisans\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Cayenne Market**: a bustling market with a range of local produce and handicrafts, located in the heart of Cayenne\n- **Kourou Market**: a smaller market with a range of local produce and seafood, located in the coastal town of Kourou\n- **Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni Market**: a market with a range of local produce and handicrafts, located in the town of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni\n- **Soirée Créole**: a traditional evening with music, dance, and local cuisine, held in various locations throughout the territory\n- **Food Festival**: an annual festival with a range of local dishes and drinks, held in the capital city of Cayenne",
