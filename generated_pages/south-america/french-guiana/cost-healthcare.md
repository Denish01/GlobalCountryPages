[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
French Guiana has a **universal healthcare system**, which provides comprehensive coverage to all residents, including foreigners who are legally residing in the territory. The system is largely funded by the French government, and residents are required to have health insurance, either through their employer or by purchasing it individually. Public healthcare services are generally of good quality, but may have longer wait times and less availability of specialized care. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, offer more convenience and specialized care, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in French Guiana, as the public system may not cover all expenses.

The healthcare system in French Guiana is generally well-organized, with a network of public hospitals and clinics, as well as private healthcare providers. However, the system can be complex, and foreigners may need to navigate the system with the help of a translator or a healthcare professional. Additionally, some medical specialties may not be available in French Guiana, and patients may need to be evacuated to France or another country for specialized care. It is essential for foreigners to research and understand the healthcare system in French Guiana before moving to the territory, and to consider purchasing private health insurance that covers them in case of an emergency.
