[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
French Guiana has an upper-middle-income economy, with a strong focus on services and industry. The territory's economy is closely tied to that of France, and as such, it benefits from significant investment and subsidies from the French government. The economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, driven by a combination of traditional industries such as agriculture and mining, as well as a growing services sector. However, the territory still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a lack of economic diversification.

The territory's economy is also driven by its unique location, with French Guiana serving as a key hub for space exploration and development. The Guiana Space Centre, located near the city of Kourou, is one of the most advanced space centers in the world and has been used for numerous high-profile launches, including those of the European Space Agency. This industry has brought significant investment and job creation to the territory, and has helped to drive economic growth.

Despite these strengths, French Guiana's economy still faces significant challenges, including a high cost of living and a lack of economic diversification. The territory is heavily reliant on imports, and the cost of living is significantly higher than in other parts of South America. Additionally, the economy is vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy, particularly in the space industry, which is a key driver of economic growth.
