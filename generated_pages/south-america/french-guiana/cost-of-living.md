[SECTION] How Expensive Is French Guiana? [/SECTION]
French Guiana is an overseas department of France, and as such, the cost of living is similar to that of metropolitan France, which is one of the most expensive countries in Europe. The high cost of living in French Guiana is due to the fact that most goods are imported from France, making them subject to high transportation costs and import taxes. Additionally, the country's remote location and limited economic activity contribute to the high cost of living. Compared to its neighbors, Brazil and Suriname, French Guiana is significantly more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being among the highest in the region.

The high cost of living in French Guiana is also reflected in the prices of everyday items, such as food, transportation, and housing. For example, a meal at a mid-range restaurant can cost around $20-30 USD per person, while a monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment can range from $800-1,200 USD. However, despite the high cost of living, French Guiana offers a unique cultural experience, with a mix of French and Caribbean influences, and a stunning natural environment, with lush rainforests, beautiful beaches, and a diverse wildlife.
