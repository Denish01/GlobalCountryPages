The territory's economy is closely tied to that of France, and as such, it benefits from significant investment and subsidies from the French government. The economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, driven by a combination of traditional industries such as agriculture and mining, as well as a growing services sector. However, the territory still faces significant challenges, including a high unemployment rate and a lack of economic diversification.\n\nThe territory's economy is also driven by its unique location, with French Guiana serving as a key hub for space exploration and development. The Guiana Space Centre, located near the city of Kourou, is one of the most advanced space centers in the world and has been used for numerous high-profile launches, including those of the European Space Agency. This industry has brought significant investment and job creation to the territory, and has helped to drive economic growth.\n\nDespite these strengths, French Guiana's economy still faces significant challenges, including a high cost of living and a lack of economic diversification. The territory is heavily reliant on imports, and the cost of living is significantly higher than in other parts of South America. Additionally, the economy is vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy, particularly in the space industry, which is a key driver of economic growth.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Space industry | 20% | The Guiana Space Centre is a key hub for space exploration and development, with numerous high-profile launches taking place each year |\n| Agriculture | 15% | French Guiana is a significant producer of crops such as sugarcane, bananas, and rice, with a focus on export-oriented production |\n| Mining | 10% | The territory is rich in mineral resources, including gold, bauxite, and kaolin, with several major mining operations taking place |\n| Services | 40% | The services sector is a significant driver of economic growth, with a focus on finance, tourism, and logistics |\n| Manufacturing | 5% | The manufacturing sector is relatively small, but is focused on producing goods such as food and beverages, and construction materials |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Space launch services**, which are a key driver of economic growth\n- **Agricultural products**, such as sugarcane, bananas, and rice\n- **Minerals**, including gold, bauxite, and kaolin\n- **Wood products**, including timber and paper\n- **Fish and seafood**, with a focus on export-oriented production\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food and beverages**, which are largely imported due to the high cost of production in the territory\n- **Fuel and energy**, which are necessary to power the territory's homes and industries\n- **Machinery and equipment**, which are used in the territory's manufacturing and mining sectors\n- **Transportation vehicles**, which are necessary for the territory's transportation network\n- **Electronics and appliances**, which are in high demand due to the territory's growing middle class\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- France, which is the territory's largest trading partner and provides significant investment and subsidies\n- Brazil, which is a key partner for trade and investment in the region\n- The Netherlands, which is a significant trading partner due to the presence of Suriname, a former Dutch colony, on the territory's border\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The territory has a well-developed transportation network, including a major airport and several ports\n- The energy sector is largely driven by imported fuel, but there are also efforts to develop renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power\n- Internet and mobile penetration are relatively high, with a focus on developing the territory's digital infrastructure\n- The territory has a number of major ports, including the port of Dégrad des Cannes, which is a key hub for trade and commerce\n- The Guiana Space Centre is a significant piece of infrastructure, with a focus on space exploration and development\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe economic outlook for French Guiana is generally positive, with a focus on driving economic growth and development.
