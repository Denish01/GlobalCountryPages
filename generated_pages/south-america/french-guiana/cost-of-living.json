  "content": "The cost of living in French Guiana is relatively high compared to other South American countries, with a daily budget of $80-150 USD per person for a mid-range traveler. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nCost Level: Expensive\nDaily Budget (Backpacker): $60-100 USD\nDaily Budget (Mid-Range): $100-180 USD\nDaily Budget (Comfort): $200-300 USD\nCurrency: EUR\nTipping Custom: not expected\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] How Expensive Is French Guiana? [/SECTION]\nFrench Guiana is an overseas department of France, and as such, the cost of living is similar to that of metropolitan France, which is one of the most expensive countries in Europe. The high cost of living in French Guiana is due to the fact that most goods are imported from France, making them subject to high transportation costs and import taxes. Additionally, the country's remote location and limited economic activity contribute to the high cost of living. Compared to its neighbors, Brazil and Suriname, French Guiana is significantly more expensive, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being among the highest in the region.\n\nThe high cost of living in French Guiana is also reflected in the prices of everyday items, such as food, transportation, and housing. For example, a meal at a mid-range restaurant can cost around $20-30 USD per person, while a monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment can range from $800-1,200 USD. However, despite the high cost of living, French Guiana offers a unique cultural experience, with a mix of French and Caribbean influences, and a stunning natural environment, with lush rainforests, beautiful beaches, and a diverse wildlife.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $30-60 | basic amenities, shared rooms |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $100-200 | comfortable rooms, air conditioning, TV |\n| Luxury/Resort | $250-500 | high-end amenities, private beach, spa |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $800-1,500 | city center, one-bedroom apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-20 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-60 |\n| Fine Dining | $80-120 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $2-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-5 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $2-5 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 800 | 1,200 | 1,800 |\n| Food | 500 | 800 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 150 | 200 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 300 | 500 |\n| **Total** | **1,700** | **2,650** | **4,000** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in a hostel or guesthouse instead of a hotel to save on accommodation costs.\n- Eat at local markets or street food stalls instead of restaurants to save on food costs.\n- Use public transportation instead of taxis to get around.\n- Buy groceries at local markets instead of supermarkets to save on food costs.\n- Avoid traveling during peak season (December to April) to save on accommodation and transportation costs.\n- Consider renting an apartment outside of the city center to save on rent costs.\n\nNote: Prices are approximate and can vary depending on the location, season, and other factors.
