[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet quality in French Guiana is generally good, with average download speeds of 10 Mbps, which is sufficient for basic online activities such as browsing, emailing, and social media. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in urban areas like Cayenne, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet connection can also vary depending on the provider and the location, but overall, it is possible to stay connected and get work done.

The government of French Guiana has been investing in improving the telecommunications infrastructure, including the deployment of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile networks. As a result, the internet has become more accessible and affordable for the local population, with many households and businesses having a reliable connection. However, there are still some challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas where the infrastructure is less developed.
