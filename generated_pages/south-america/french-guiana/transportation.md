[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in French Guiana is the Cayenne Félix Eboué Airport (CAY), which receives flights from Paris, Miami, and other Caribbean islands. There are no direct flights from most European or American cities, so you may need to connect through Paris or another Caribbean hub. The airport is located about 13 kilometers southwest of Cayenne, the capital city, and offers taxi and rental car services. Overland entry points are limited, but you can enter French Guiana by road from Brazil or Suriname, although this may require special permits and visas.

If you plan to enter French Guiana by land, be sure to research the requirements for visas, customs, and border crossings, as these can be complex and subject to change. The main border crossing with Brazil is at Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, while the border with Suriname is at Albina. Both crossings are relatively remote, and you may need to hire a guide or join a tour to navigate the process.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
French Guiana has a limited domestic air network, with flights connecting Cayenne to the coastal towns of Kourou, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, and Maripasoula. The main domestic airline is Air Guyane, which offers regular flights to these destinations. You can book flights online or through a local travel agent, and prices start from around 100 euros for a one-way ticket. Be sure to book in advance, as flights can be infrequent and may fill up quickly, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
French Guiana has no rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the territory. This is due to the challenging terrain and the fact that the territory is relatively small, making road and air transport more practical. If you are looking for a scenic way to travel, you may consider taking a boat or ferry along the coast, but these services are limited and may not be available to all destinations.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus services in French Guiana are limited, but you can find buses connecting Cayenne to other coastal towns and villages. The main bus company is **TCG (Transport en Commun de Guyane)**, which offers regular services to destinations such as Kourou, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, and Iracoubo. Buses are generally comfortable and affordable, with prices starting from around 10 euros for a one-way ticket. However, be prepared for rough roads and limited schedules, especially in rural areas.
