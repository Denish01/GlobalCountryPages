Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of French Guiana before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nFrench Guiana has a moderate visa policy, with citizens of around 50 countries eligible for visa-free access, including those from the European Union, the United States, Canada, and Australia. However, the length of stay and other requirements can vary depending on the nationality and purpose of the visit. The territory's visa policy is largely aligned with that of France, given its status as an overseas department of the country. This means that many of the same rules and regulations apply, although there may be some specific exceptions or additional requirements for French Guiana.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel and trade with the need to maintain security and control over who enters the territory. As a result, citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access will need to apply for a visa at a French embassy or consulate before traveling to French Guiana. In some cases, it may be possible to obtain a visa on arrival, but this is typically only available for citizens of certain countries and is subject to specific requirements and restrictions.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Freedom of movement applies, but must still register with local authorities |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at a French embassy or consulate before traveling |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for a visa at a French embassy or consulate before traveling |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in French Guiana for up to 90 days without a visa, although this can vary depending on nationality.
