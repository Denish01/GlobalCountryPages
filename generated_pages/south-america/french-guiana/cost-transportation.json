The main transportation modes in French Guiana are buses, taxis, and private vehicles, with most people relying on their own cars to get around. The quality of public transit is relatively poor, with limited routes and schedules, making it difficult for tourists and locals alike to navigate the territory without a car.\n\nThe road network in French Guiana is decent, but traffic can be heavy in urban areas, especially during rush hour. The lack of a subway or metro system means that buses and taxis are the primary modes of public transportation, with minibus services also available in some areas. Despite the challenges, the scenic routes and picturesque landscapes make driving in French Guiana a pleasant experience, with many opportunities to explore the territory's natural beauty.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2 | $60 | Limited routes and schedules |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $3 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in urban areas |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5 | $2 | $10-$15 | Available in urban areas |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $5 | $1.50 | $10-$15 | Uber, Bolt available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, approximately 15-20 km |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.30 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options in urban areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mainly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-$30 | Limited routes, mainly to neighboring towns |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, e.g., Cayenne to Maripasoula |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use public transportation or walk whenever possible to save money and experience the local culture.\n- Download ride-hailing apps like Uber or Bolt to get around urban areas.\n- Negotiate taxi fares in advance, especially for longer trips or airport transfers.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep valuables secure, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or exploring the territory's natural beauty, but be mindful of fuel costs and parking options.\n- Always check the latest schedules and fares for public transportation to plan your trip accordingly.",
