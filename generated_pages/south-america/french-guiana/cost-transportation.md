[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Getting around French Guiana can be challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system, especially outside of the capital city, Cayenne. The main transportation modes in French Guiana are buses, taxis, and private vehicles, with most people relying on their own cars to get around. The quality of public transit is relatively poor, with limited routes and schedules, making it difficult for tourists and locals alike to navigate the territory without a car.

The road network in French Guiana is decent, but traffic can be heavy in urban areas, especially during rush hour. The lack of a subway or metro system means that buses and taxis are the primary modes of public transportation, with minibus services also available in some areas. Despite the challenges, the scenic routes and picturesque landscapes make driving in French Guiana a pleasant experience, with many opportunities to explore the territory's natural beauty.
