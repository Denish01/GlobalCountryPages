[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Peru's linguistic landscape is characterized by the dominance of Spanish, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. However, there are also several indigenous languages, including Quechua and Aymara, which are widely spoken in different regions of the country. Quechua, for example, is spoken by around 20% of the population, particularly in the Andean highlands, while Aymara is spoken by around 2% of the population, mainly in the southern region of Puno. Regional dialects of Spanish also vary across the country, with distinct accents and vocabulary used in different areas. Despite the limited English proficiency, many Peruvians in the tourism industry, such as hotel staff and tour guides, speak some English, making it possible for visitors to communicate and navigate the country.

The use of indigenous languages is an important part of Peruvian culture and identity, and efforts are being made to promote and preserve these languages. However, Spanish remains the primary language used in education, government, and media, and is widely understood by the majority of the population. In urban areas, such as Lima, Spanish is the dominant language, while in rural areas, indigenous languages may be more widely spoken.

Peru's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the many languages spoken by immigrant communities, including Chinese, Japanese, and Italian. However, these languages are not as widely spoken as Spanish, and visitors are unlikely to encounter them in their daily interactions.
