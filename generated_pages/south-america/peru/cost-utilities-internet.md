[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Peru's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning. The Peruvian government has implemented measures to stabilize utility prices, but costs can still vary depending on the region and provider. Additionally, the cost of utilities can be affected by the country's inflation rate, which was 2.0% in 2024.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Peru is generally good, with most households having access to reliable electricity, water, and gas services. However, there can be occasional outages and disruptions, particularly during heavy rainfall or flooding. The government has invested in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities can still be a significant burden for many households, particularly those with lower incomes.
