[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Peru operates on a **territorial taxation** system, where only income earned within the country is subject to taxation, except for **Peruvian tax residents** who are taxed on their worldwide income. To be considered a tax resident in Peru, an individual must have a permanent home in the country, or spend more than 183 days in a calendar year in Peru. The tax system is overseen by the **Sunat (Superintendencia Nacional de Administración Tributaria)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs, and other government revenues.

The Peruvian tax system is designed to promote economic growth and investment, with various incentives and exemptions available to encourage foreign investment and trade. The country has a network of **double taxation treaties** with 16 countries, which helps to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion. These treaties also provide a framework for the exchange of tax information and cooperation between tax authorities. Peru's tax system is also subject to international standards and guidelines, such as those set by the **Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**.
