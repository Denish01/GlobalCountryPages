[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Peru is generally of good quality, with average download speeds of around 15 Mbps, although this can vary depending on the location and the service provider. In urban areas such as Lima, the internet is widely available and reliable, with many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offering free WiFi. However, in rural areas, the internet can be slower and less reliable, with limited coverage and a greater reliance on mobile networks. The urban-rural divide in terms of internet access is a significant issue in Peru, with many rural communities lacking access to fast and reliable internet.

Despite these challenges, the Peruvian government has made efforts to improve internet access in recent years, including the launch of a national broadband plan aimed at increasing access to high-speed internet in rural areas. As a result, the internet is becoming increasingly available and affordable, with many Peruvians now using the internet to access a range of services, including online banking, shopping, and education. However, the reliability of the internet can still be a problem, with outages and slow speeds common during peak hours or in areas with high demand.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Peru is relatively straightforward, with many mobile providers offering prepaid plans and tourist SIM cards. The main carriers, including Claro, Movistar, and Entel, have stores and kiosks in major cities and towns, where you can purchase a SIM card and register for a plan. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, and you may also need to register your SIM card with the authorities. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, and data plans start from around 5 USD per month for 1GB of data.

It's worth noting that some carriers may offer better coverage and service in certain areas, so it's a good idea to research the different options and choose a carrier that meets your needs. For example, Claro has a strong presence in urban areas, while Movistar has better coverage in rural areas. You can also purchase SIM cards at airports, bus stations, and other tourist areas, making it easy to get connected as soon as you arrive in the country.
