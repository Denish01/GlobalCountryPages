However, the cost of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning. The Peruvian government has implemented measures to stabilize utility prices, but costs can still vary depending on the region and provider. Additionally, the cost of utilities can be affected by the country's inflation rate, which was 2.0% in 2024.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Peru is generally good, with most households having access to reliable electricity, water, and gas services. However, there can be occasional outages and disruptions, particularly during heavy rainfall or flooding. The government has invested in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities can still be a significant burden for many households, particularly those with lower incomes.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $15 | $25 | $35 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$60** | **$100** | **$140** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Movistar, Claro |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | Movistar, Claro |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Movistar, Claro, Entel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-50 GB | Movistar, Claro, Entel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Movistar, Claro |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Peru, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as Movistar or Claro, and provide the necessary documentation, including a passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for those who want to control their energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Peru are Movistar and Claro, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of promotional offers and discounts from providers.\n- It is also a good idea to research and compare prices from different providers to find the best deals and plans for your specific needs.",
