[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Peru is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to two consecutive terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral Congress, which has 130 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of a Supreme Court and lower courts.

The Peruvian government is **unitary**, meaning that the central government has the primary authority to make and enforce laws. The country is divided into 25 regions, each with a regional government that has some autonomy to manage local affairs. However, the central government retains significant powers, including the authority to appoint regional governors and oversee regional finances.

The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Peruvian Constitution, which establishes checks and balances among the three branches of government. The President has the power to veto laws passed by Congress, but Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority. The Supreme Court has the power to declare laws unconstitutional, and the President appoints judges to the Supreme Court with the approval of Congress.
