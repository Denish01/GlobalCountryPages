  "content": "Healthcare in Peru is a mixed system that combines public and private providers, offering a range of options for both locals and foreigners, although the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 106\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nPeru's healthcare system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector providing **universal access** to healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and medications, to all citizens. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. The quality of care in Peru's healthcare system can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. In general, the healthcare system in Peru is considered to be of **medium quality**, with both public and private providers offering a range of services, including specialized care and emergency services.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Peru is funded through a combination of government funding and **social security** contributions, and provides access to healthcare services for all citizens, including those who cannot afford to pay. However, the public system is often overcrowded and understaffed, and patients may experience long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private sector offers higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost, making it more accessible to those who can afford to pay.\n\nDespite these challenges, Peru has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including increasing access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, and improving the quality of care. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening the healthcare system, including the introduction of a new **health insurance** scheme and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clinica Anglo Americana | Lima | Private | Cardiology, Oncology, Neurology | Yes |\n| Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins | Lima | Public | Emergency, Trauma, General Surgery | Limited |\n| Clinica Internacional | Lima | Private | Orthopedics, Urology, Gynecology | Yes |\n| Hospital Regional de Cusco | Cusco | Public | Emergency, General Medicine, Pediatrics | Limited |\n| Clinica San Borja | Lima | Private | Cardiology, Neurology, Psychiatry | Yes |\n| Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen | Lima | Public | Emergency, Trauma, General Surgery | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Travel insurance** is highly recommended for foreigners visiting Peru, as it can help cover the cost of medical care in the event of an emergency.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including the Peruvian government's **Seguro Integral de Salud** (SIS) program, which provides access to healthcare services for low-income individuals and families.\n- **Expats** can also purchase private health insurance plans, which can provide access to higher-quality care and shorter wait times.\n- The cost of health insurance in Peru can vary depending on the provider and the level of coverage, but on average, a private health insurance plan can cost between **500-1,500 PEN** per month.\n- **Pre-existing conditions** may be excluded from coverage, so it's essential to carefully review the terms of any insurance policy before purchasing.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacies** are widely available in Peru, particularly in urban areas, and offer a range of medications, including **over-the-counter** and **prescription** medications.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but in general, a prescription from a licensed physician is required to purchase **controlled substances**.\n- **Common brands** of medications are widely available in Peru, including **international brands** and **generic alternatives**.\n- The cost of medications in Peru can vary depending on the type and brand, but on average, **generic medications** can be significantly cheaper than **brand-name medications**.\n- **Vaccinations** and other preventive medications are also widely available in Peru, and can be purchased at pharmacies or through healthcare providers.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Yellow fever** vaccination is recommended for travelers to certain areas of Peru, including the Amazon rainforest.\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are also recommended for all travelers to Peru.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Peru, particularly in the Amazon rainforest, and travelers should take precautions to avoid **mosquito bites**.\n- **Dengue fever** and **Zika virus** are also present in Peru, and travelers should take precautions to avoid **mosquito bites**.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Peru, particularly in rural areas, and travelers should avoid drinking **untreated water**.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern in Peru, and travelers should avoid eating **undercooked** or **raw** foods.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is a growing industry in Peru, with many hospitals and clinics offering specialized care and services to international patients.\n- **Popular procedures** include **cosmetic surgery**, **dentistry**, and **fertility treatments**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Peru include the Clinica Anglo Americana and the Clinica San Borja, which offer high-quality care and services to international patients.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists in Peru, with many procedures costing **30-50% less** than in the US or Europe.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, dial **106** to reach the Peruvian emergency services.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can vary depending on the location, but in general, ambulances are available in urban areas and can be summoned through emergency services.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found through online directories or by contacting the Peruvian tourism board.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted to the insurance provider as soon as possible, and may require documentation and receipts from healthcare providers.\n- **Language barriers** can be a challenge in emergency situations, so it's essential to have a **translation service** or **interpreter** available.",
