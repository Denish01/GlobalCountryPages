The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to two consecutive terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral Congress, which has 130 members elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of a Supreme Court and lower courts.\n\nThe Peruvian government is **unitary**, meaning that the central government has the primary authority to make and enforce laws. The country is divided into 25 regions, each with a regional government that has some autonomy to manage local affairs. However, the central government retains significant powers, including the authority to appoint regional governors and oversee regional finances.\n\nThe **separation of powers** is enshrined in the Peruvian Constitution, which establishes checks and balances among the three branches of government. The President has the power to veto laws passed by Congress, but Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority. The Supreme Court has the power to declare laws unconstitutional, and the President appoints judges to the Supreme Court with the approval of Congress.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency of Peru | President of Peru | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Prime Minister | Head of government administration |\n| Legislative | Congress of the Republic of Peru | President of Congress | Legislative leader |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Peru | President of the Supreme Court | Head of the judiciary |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Popular Force | Right-wing | Keiko Fujimori | 24 | Largest opposition party |\n| Peruvian Aprista Party | Center-left | César Acuña | 15 | Former ruling party |\n| Broad Front | Left-wing | Marco Arana | 20 | Coalition of left-wing parties |\n| Popular Action | Center-right | Mesías Guevara | 16 | Former ruling party |\n| Alliance for Progress | Center-right | César Acuña | 9 | Regional party with national presence |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Peru is based on **proportional representation**, with voters electing representatives to Congress and the President through separate ballots.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent presidential election taking place in 2021.\n- The last congressional election was held in 2021, with the next election scheduled for 2026.\n- Voter participation is mandatory for citizens between the ages of 18 and 70, with a turnout of around 80% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Peru is marked by **instability and polarization**, with frequent changes in government and a fragmented Congress.\n- Key issues facing the government include **corruption**, **poverty**, and **inequality**, which have contributed to widespread protests and social unrest.\n- Regional dynamics are also a challenge, with **border disputes** with neighboring countries and **insurgent groups** operating in some areas.\n- Peru ranks 43rd out of 180 countries in the 2022 **Press Freedom Index**, with some restrictions on media freedom and journalist safety.\n- The country also faces **environmental challenges**, including deforestation and pollution, which have sparked controversy and debate over government policies.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Peru is a member of the **United Nations**, the **Organization of American States**, and the **Andean Community of Nations**, among other international organizations.\n- The country has **diplomatic relations** with over 140 countries and has **free trade agreements** with several nations, including the United States, China, and the European Union.\n- Peru is also a member of the **Pacific Alliance**, a regional trade bloc that aims to promote economic integration and cooperation among member states.\n- The country has a **border dispute** with Chile, which has been ongoing for several years and has led to tensions between the two nations.\n- Peru has also been **critical of Venezuelan government policies**, and has supported regional efforts to address the **Venezuelan migrant crisis**.",
