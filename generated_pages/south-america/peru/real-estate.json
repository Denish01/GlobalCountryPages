The market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a wide range of prices and options available. In recent years, there has been an increase in demand for properties in urban areas, particularly in Lima, where prices have risen significantly. However, the market remains relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available and relatively low interest rates.\n\nThe price trajectory in Peru has been upward, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per year over the past few years. However, the market is not without its challenges, and there are concerns about the impact of economic uncertainty and political instability on the market. Urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, with prices in cities like Lima and Cusco being significantly higher than in smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe property market in Peru is also influenced by the country's tourism industry, with many foreigners buying properties in popular tourist destinations like Cusco, Machu Picchu, and the coastal towns of Mancora and Huacas. This has driven up prices in these areas, but has also created opportunities for property owners to rent out their properties to tourists and generate income.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lima | 1,500 | 400 | Apartment |\n| Miraflores | 2,000 | 600 | Apartment |\n| Cusco | 1,000 | 300 | House |\n| Mancora | 800 | 200 | Beachfront |\n| Arequipa | 600 | 150 | House |\n| Trujillo | 500 | 100 | Colonial |\n| Huacas | 700 | 250 | Beachfront |\n| San Isidro | 2,500 | 800 | Luxury Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Peru, but they must obtain a **Residency Visa** or a **Temporary Visa** to do so.\n- Foreigners can also buy property through a **Peruvian Company**, which can be set up with the help of a lawyer or accountant.\n- There are no restrictions on the type of property that can be bought, but foreigners must register their property with the **Peruvian Registry of Property**.\n- Foreigners must also obtain a **Tax Identification Number** (RUC) to pay taxes on their property.\n- Foreigners can lease property in Peru, but the lease must be registered with the **Peruvian Registry of Property**.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
