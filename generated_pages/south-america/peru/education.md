The education system in Peru is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **educación primaria**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 11 and lasts for six years. Secondary education, or **educación secundaria**, is also compulsory and lasts for five years, from ages 12 to 16. Tertiary education, or **educación superior**, includes universities, technical institutes, and other higher education institutions, and is not compulsory. The quality of education in Peru varies greatly between public and private institutions, with private schools generally offering higher quality education and better resources.

The public education system in Peru faces several challenges, including a lack of funding, outdated curricula, and inadequate infrastructure. However, in recent years, the government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the quality of education, such as the introduction of **new curricula** and the provision of **teacher training programs**. Despite these efforts, the public education system still lags behind private institutions in terms of quality and resources.
