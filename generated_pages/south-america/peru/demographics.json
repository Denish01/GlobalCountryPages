The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the years, with an estimated 1.2% annual growth rate. Urbanization is a notable trend in Peru, with approximately 78% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in cities like Lima and Arequipa.

However, in recent years, there has been an increase in return migration, with many Peruvians returning to their home country due to improved economic conditions.\n\nThe population size and growth trends in Peru have significant implications for the country's economy, education system, and healthcare services. The government has implemented various policies to address the challenges posed by population growth, including family planning programs and investments in education and healthcare infrastructure. Despite these efforts, Peru still faces significant demographic challenges, including a high fertility rate and a rapidly aging population.\n\nPeru's population is also characterized by a significant youth bulge, with approximately 25% of the population under the age of 15.
