Peruvian cuisine is a rich and diverse blend of different cultures, including indigenous, Spanish, African, and Asian influences. The country's unique geography, with its coastal, Andean, and Amazonian regions, has also contributed to the development of distinct regional cuisines. In the coastal region, seafood is a staple, while in the Andean highlands, dishes are often based on potatoes, corn, and other native crops.
