[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Peru's housing market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional properties, with a growing demand for rental apartments in urban areas. The rental market is relatively **unregulated**, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months. Deposit requirements are usually equivalent to one or two months' rent, and tenant rights are limited. Compared to its regional neighbors, Peru's housing costs are relatively **affordable**, with prices lower than in Chile and Colombia, but higher than in Bolivia and Ecuador.

The Peruvian government has implemented policies to increase access to housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable housing. However, the **shortage of affordable housing** remains a significant challenge, particularly in urban areas like Lima. As a result, many renters opt for shared apartments or rooms, which can be more affordable than renting a single apartment.
