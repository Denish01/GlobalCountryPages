  "content": "The primary language spoken in Peru is Spanish, which is the official language and widely understood throughout the country. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Spanish\nWidely Spoken: Quechua, Aymara\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nPeru's linguistic landscape is characterized by the dominance of Spanish, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. However, there are also several indigenous languages, including Quechua and Aymara, which are widely spoken in different regions of the country. Quechua, for example, is spoken by around 20% of the population, particularly in the Andean highlands, while Aymara is spoken by around 2% of the population, mainly in the southern region of Puno. Regional dialects of Spanish also vary across the country, with distinct accents and vocabulary used in different areas. Despite the limited English proficiency, many Peruvians in the tourism industry, such as hotel staff and tour guides, speak some English, making it possible for visitors to communicate and navigate the country.\n\nThe use of indigenous languages is an important part of Peruvian culture and identity, and efforts are being made to promote and preserve these languages. However, Spanish remains the primary language used in education, government, and media, and is widely understood by the majority of the population. In urban areas, such as Lima, Spanish is the dominant language, while in rural areas, indigenous languages may be more widely spoken.\n\nPeru's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the many languages spoken by immigrant communities, including Chinese, Japanese, and Italian. However, these languages are not as widely spoken as Spanish, and visitors are unlikely to encounter them in their daily interactions.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola | OH-lah | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Buenos días | BWEH-nohs DEE-ahs | informal, daytime |\n| Thank you | Gracias | GRAH-see-ahs |  |\n| Please | Por favor | pawr fah-VOHR |  |\n| Yes / No | Sí / No | SEE / noh |  |\n| Excuse me | Con permiso | kohn pehr-MEE-soh |  |\n| How much? | Cuánto cuesta | KWAHN-toh KWEHS-tah |  |\n| Where is...? | Dónde está...? | DOHN-deh EH-stah |  |\n| I don't understand | No entiendo | noh ehn-tee-EHN-doh |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Habla inglés | AH-blah eeng-lee-EHZ |  |\n| Help! | Ayuda | ah-YOO-dah |  |\n| Goodbye | Adiós | ah-DEE-yos | formal |\n| Sorry | Lo siento | LOH see-en-toh |  |\n| How are you? | ¿Cómo estás? | KOH-moh eh-STAH | informal |\n| What's your name? | ¿Cómo te llamas? | KOH-moh teh YAH-mahs |  |\n| I'm lost | Estoy perdido | eh-STOH pehr-DEE-thoh |  |\n| Where is the restroom? | ¿Dónde está el baño? | DOHN-deh eh-STAH el BAH-nyoh |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Uno | oo-noh |\n| 2 | Dos | dohs |\n| 3 | Tres | trayhs |\n| 4 | Cuatro | kwah-troh |\n| 5 | Cinco | sing-koh |\n| 6 | Seis | sayss |\n| 7 | Siete | see-EH-teh |\n| 8 | Ocho | OH-choh |\n| 9 | Nueve | nway-VAY |\n| 10 | Diez | dee-EHZ |\n| 100 | Cien | see-EHN |\n| 1000 | Mil | meel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it's customary to use formal titles such as \"señor\" or \"señora\" until you're explicitly invited to use first names.\n- Peruvians tend to stand close to each other when conversing, so be prepared for a more intimate personal space.\n- Direct eye contact is important in Peruvian culture, as it conveys respect and sincerity.\n- Avoid using gestures that involve the left hand, as the left hand is considered unclean in some cultures.\n- When bargaining at markets, it's customary to haggle and negotiate prices, but be respectful and polite.\n- If you need help, don't hesitate to ask, and try to learn a few basic phrases in Spanish to show your effort.\n- Be mindful of your body language, as Peruvians tend to be expressive and emotive in their nonverbal communication.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app like Google Translate or iTranslate to help you communicate with locals.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help you learn basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Consider taking a Spanish language course or using online resources to learn the basics before your trip.\n- Look for restaurants, hotels, and tour operators that offer English-language services to make your trip easier.\n- Don't be afraid to ask locals for help or clarification if you're unsure about something, and try to learn from your interactions with them.",
