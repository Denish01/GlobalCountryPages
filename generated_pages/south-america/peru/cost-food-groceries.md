[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Peru can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices around 10-20% higher than those found at local markets. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and can be more convenient for those looking for a one-stop shopping experience. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more authentic shopping experience, with vendors selling fresh produce, meats, and other staples at competitive prices. When shopping at local markets, it is common to **haggle** over prices, especially when buying in bulk.

When deciding where to shop, it is worth considering what you need to buy. For fresh produce, local markets are often the best option, with vendors offering a wide range of fruits and vegetables at competitive prices. For packaged goods, such as rice, pasta, and canned goods, supermarkets may be a better option. Additionally, supermarkets often have a wider range of **organic** and **specialty** products, which may be harder to find at local markets. By shopping at a combination of both supermarkets and local markets, you can take advantage of the best prices and products that each has to offer.
