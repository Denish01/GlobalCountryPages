# Peru Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Peru's culture is a rich and diverse blend of indigenous, Spanish, African, and Asian influences. The country's strategic location in South America, bordering the Pacific Ocean, has made it a melting pot of cultures for centuries. The Inca Empire, which once flourished in the region, has left a lasting legacy in the country's language, customs, and traditions. Today, Peru is home to 34 million people, with the majority speaking Spanish as their primary language. However, there are also many indigenous languages spoken, including Quechua and Aymara, which are recognized as official languages.

Peru's ethnic makeup is also diverse, with a mix of indigenous, European, African, and Asian communities. The country's coastal regions are predominantly mestizo, a term used to describe people of mixed European and indigenous ancestry. In the Andean highlands, indigenous communities continue to preserve their traditional way of life, with many still speaking their native languages and practicing their ancestral customs. The Amazon rainforest region is home to a diverse array of indigenous groups, each with their own unique culture and traditions.

Peru's cultural identity is also shaped by its history of colonization and immigration. The Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in the 16th century had a profound impact on the country's language, religion, and customs. African slaves were brought to Peru during the colonial period, and their descendants have made significant contributions to the country's music, dance, and art. More recently, immigrants from Asia, particularly China and Japan, have also had an impact on Peruvian culture, introducing new customs and traditions to the country.
