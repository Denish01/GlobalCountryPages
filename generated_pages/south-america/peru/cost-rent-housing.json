The rental market is relatively **unregulated**, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months. Deposit requirements are usually equivalent to one or two months' rent, and tenant rights are limited. Compared to its regional neighbors, Peru's housing costs are relatively **affordable**, with prices lower than in Chile and Colombia, but higher than in Bolivia and Ecuador.\n\nThe Peruvian government has implemented policies to increase access to housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable housing. However, the **shortage of affordable housing** remains a significant challenge, particularly in urban areas like Lima. As a result, many renters opt for shared apartments or rooms, which can be more affordable than renting a single apartment.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | (typical quality, 20-30 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $200-$400 | (what to expect, 40-60 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $300-$600 | (family size, 80-100 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $700-$1,200 | $500-$1,000 | (spacious, 120-150 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | (prime locations, such as Miraflores or San Isidro) |\n| Suburbs | $800-$2,000 | (residential areas, such as Surquillo or La Molina) |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | (if applicable, such as in the Andean highlands) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Miraflores**: a popular neighborhood in Lima, known for its vibrant nightlife, shopping, and dining options, with typical rent ranges from $400 to $800 USD per month.\n- **San Isidro**: a upscale neighborhood in Lima, characterized by its modern architecture, parks, and business centers, with typical rent ranges from $500 to $1,000 USD per month.\n- **Barranco**: a bohemian neighborhood in Lima, known for its artistic vibe, street art, and trendy restaurants, with typical rent ranges from $300 to $600 USD per month.\n- **Surquillo**: a residential neighborhood in Lima, popular with families and expats, with typical rent ranges from $250 to $500 USD per month.\n- **La Molina**: a suburban neighborhood in Lima, known for its green spaces, shopping centers, and modern housing, with typical rent ranges from $200 to $400 USD per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Peru [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your lifestyle and budget.\n- **Negotiate** rent prices, as they are often **flexible**, especially for longer-term leases.\n- Be cautious of **scams**, such as fake rental listings or unscrupulous landlords, and always inspect properties before signing a lease.\n- Utilities, such as water and electricity, are usually **not included** in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget.\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished ones, so be prepared to **bring your own furniture** or negotiate with the landlord.\n- Consider working with a **reputable real estate agent** to find a rental property, as they can provide valuable guidance and support throughout the process.",
