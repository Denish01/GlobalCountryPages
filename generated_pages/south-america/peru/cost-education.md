[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Peru's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being free or heavily subsidized, but often lacking in quality and resources. The private system, on the other hand, offers higher-quality education, but at a significant cost. The language of instruction is primarily **Spanish**, although some private schools may offer instruction in other languages. Compulsory education in Peru lasts for 12 years, from age 5 to 17, and is divided into primary, secondary, and vocational education. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of **Lima**, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **British** and **American** curricula.

The quality of education in Peru's public system is often criticized for being inadequate, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, computers, and qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools and international institutions offer a much higher level of education, with smaller class sizes, better facilities, and more qualified teachers. However, these institutions are often expensive and out of reach for many Peruvian families. For expats and international students, Peru offers a range of educational options, including international schools, private schools, and universities, although the quality and cost can vary significantly.
