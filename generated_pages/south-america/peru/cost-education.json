The private system, on the other hand, offers higher-quality education, but at a significant cost. The language of instruction is primarily **Spanish**, although some private schools may offer instruction in other languages. Compulsory education in Peru lasts for 12 years, from age 5 to 17, and is divided into primary, secondary, and vocational education. International schools are also available, primarily in the capital city of **Lima**, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **British** and **American** curricula.\n\nThe quality of education in Peru's public system is often criticized for being inadequate, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, computers, and qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools and international institutions offer a much higher level of education, with smaller class sizes, better facilities, and more qualified teachers. However, these institutions are often expensive and out of reach for many Peruvian families. For expats and international students, Peru offers a range of educational options, including international schools, private schools, and universities, although the quality and cost can vary significantly.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can be low, limited resources |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range depends on tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can be low, limited resources |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$3,500 | Range depends on tier and location |\n| International School | $2,000-$6,000 | Curriculum types include IB, British, and American |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited spots available for international students |\n| Private University | $2,000-$4,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Range depends on institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$5,000 | $4,000-$7,000 | **Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru** is a top-ranked private university |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$150 | Limited availability outside of major cities |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$30 | Range depends on subject and tutor qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | **Spanish** language courses are widely available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Costs vary depending on school and grade level |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for most private and public schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **International School of Lima** and **British School of Lima** are highly-regarded options for expat families.\n- Scholarships are available for Peruvian students, but limited for international students.\n- Online learning options are becoming more widely available, with some universities offering **distance learning** programs.\n- Education quality in Peru is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, such as **Chile** and **Argentina**.\n- **Spanish** language proficiency is highly recommended for students and families moving to Peru.\n- Expats and international students should research and visit schools in person to get a sense of the quality and fit of each institution.",
