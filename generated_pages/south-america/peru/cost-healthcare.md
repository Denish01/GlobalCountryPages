[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Peru's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining public and private providers. The public healthcare system, known as **Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS)**, provides universal coverage to all citizens, but it is often underfunded and overcrowded. Private healthcare, on the other hand, is more expensive but offers better quality and shorter wait times. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary option, while foreigners often opt for private healthcare due to language barriers and higher quality standards. Insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can be high, and public healthcare may not provide the level of care they are used to.

The healthcare system in Peru is divided into three main tiers: public, semi-private, and private. The public system is free or low-cost for citizens, but it often lacks specialized care and equipment. Semi-private clinics and hospitals offer better quality care, but at a higher cost. Private hospitals and clinics, often affiliated with international organizations, provide the highest level of care, but at a significantly higher cost. Foreigners can access public healthcare, but they may need to pay out-of-pocket for services. Having insurance can help alleviate these costs and ensure access to better quality care.

In case of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the emergency number, 116, or go to the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but they may not always be reliable. For foreigners, it's recommended to go to a private hospital, as they often have better equipment and English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Lima include the **Clinica Anglo Americana** and the **Clinica Internacional**. It's also recommended to have insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations, as the quality of care can vary greatly depending on the location. In the event of an emergency, it's crucial to stay calm and seek medical attention as soon as possible.
