[SECTION] How Peru Is Divided [/SECTION]
Peru is divided into 25 regions, also known as departamentos, and 1 province, which is the Constitutional Province of Callao. Each region has its own government and is further divided into provinces, which are then divided into districts. This administrative structure allows for a degree of autonomy and regional specialization, reflecting the diverse geography, culture, and economy of Peru. The country's capital, Lima, is the largest city and the center of government, economy, and culture, while other regions have their own unique characteristics and contributions to the country as a whole.

The division of Peru into regions and provinces is based on historical, geographical, and cultural factors. The Andean highlands, the Amazon rainforest, and the coastal deserts are the main geographical regions, each with its own distinct culture, language, and traditions. The regional governments have a significant degree of autonomy, which allows them to address local issues and develop regional policies tailored to their specific needs and resources.
