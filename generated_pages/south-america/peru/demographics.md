[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Peru's population is significant in the context of South America, with the country being the fifth most populous in the region. The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the years, with an estimated 1.2% annual growth rate. Urbanization is a notable trend in Peru, with approximately 78% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in cities like Lima and Arequipa. The country has also experienced significant migration patterns, with many Peruvians moving to the United States, Spain, and other countries in search of better economic opportunities. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in return migration, with many Peruvians returning to their home country due to improved economic conditions.

The population size and growth trends in Peru have significant implications for the country's economy, education system, and healthcare services. The government has implemented various policies to address the challenges posed by population growth, including family planning programs and investments in education and healthcare infrastructure. Despite these efforts, Peru still faces significant demographic challenges, including a high fertility rate and a rapidly aging population.

Peru's population is also characterized by a significant youth bulge, with approximately 25% of the population under the age of 15. This demographic trend poses both opportunities and challenges for the country, as it can lead to increased economic growth and innovation, but also puts pressure on education and employment systems.
