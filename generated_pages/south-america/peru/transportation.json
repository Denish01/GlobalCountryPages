You can also enter Peru by land from neighboring countries, such as Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, and Chile, with several border crossings available, including the popular routes from Ecuador to Peru via the Pan-American Highway. Additionally, you can take a bus or drive from these countries, but be sure to research the requirements for visas, vaccinations, and customs regulations before your trip.\n\nIf you prefer to enter Peru by sea, you can take a cruise or a ferry from nearby countries, but this option is less common and often more expensive. Alternatively, you can take a bus or shuttle from neighboring countries, which can be a more affordable and convenient option. For example, you can take a bus from Ecuador's capital, Quito, to Peru's northern city, Piura, or from Bolivia's capital, La Paz, to Peru's southern city, Puno. Be sure to research the different options and choose the one that best fits your budget and travel style.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nPeru has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights to major destinations, such as Cusco, Arequipa, and Iquitos. The main domestic airlines are LATAM, Avianca, and Star Peru, which operate from Lima's Jorge Chávez International Airport to various regional airports. You can book flights online or through a travel agency, and prices vary depending on the route and season, but you can expect to pay around $50-$200 for a one-way ticket. It's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best prices.\n\nWhen booking domestic flights, be sure to consider the baggage restrictions and fees, as well as any additional costs for services such as food or seat selection. Additionally, some airlines may offer discounts or promotions for students, seniors, or frequent flyers, so be sure to ask about these when booking your flight. It's also a good idea to check the weather forecast before your flight, as some regional airports may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nPeru's rail network is limited, but there are a few scenic routes that are worth taking, such as the train to Machu Picchu, which is operated by PeruRail and IncaRail. The train journey takes around 4-5 hours and offers stunning views of the Andean landscape. You can book train tickets online or through a travel agency, and prices vary depending on the class of service and season, but expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket. Be sure to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and get the best prices.\n\nThe train to Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction, and the trains are equipped with comfortable seats, food and beverage service, and large windows for taking in the views. There are also more luxurious options, such as the Belmond Hiram Bingham train, which offers gourmet meals and personalized service. If you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, you can consider taking a bus or shuttle to the town of Aguas Calientes, which is the gateway to Machu Picchu.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nPeru has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect major cities and towns, such as Lima, Cusco, Arequipa, and Iquitos.

You can book bus tickets online or at the bus terminal, and prices vary depending on the route and season, but expect to pay around $10-$50 for a one-way ticket. Be sure to research the different options and choose a reputable company to ensure a safe and comfortable journey.\n\nWhen taking the bus, be sure to arrive at the terminal early to secure a good seat, and consider bringing snacks and water, as the journey can be long and bumpy.
