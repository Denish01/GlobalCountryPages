[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Peru is a country with diverse climate zones, ranging from the tropical Amazon rainforest to the arid coastal desert and the Andean highlands. The country's climate can be divided into two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by mild temperatures, low humidity, and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit Peru. In contrast, the wet season, which occurs from October to April, is marked by heavy rainfall, potential flooding, and higher temperatures. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as some roads and trails may be closed or impassable during the wet season, while the dry season offers optimal conditions for hiking, trekking, and other outdoor activities.

The Andean highlands, where many of Peru's most popular tourist destinations are located, experience a distinct climate, with cold temperatures and potential snowfall during the winter months (June to August). The coastal region, on the other hand, has a more moderate climate, with mild temperatures and low humidity throughout the year. The Amazon rainforest, which covers a significant portion of Peru, is hot and humid year-round, with heavy rainfall during the wet season.

Understanding the seasons and climate zones is essential for planning a trip to Peru, as it can help travelers make informed decisions about when and where to go, and how to prepare for their journey. By choosing the right time to visit, travelers can ensure a safe and enjoyable experience, and make the most of their time in this incredible country.
