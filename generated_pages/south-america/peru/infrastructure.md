[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Peru's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has made significant investments in recent years to improve its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and airports. However, much of the infrastructure in rural areas remains underdeveloped, with limited access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The Peruvian government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including programs to expand electricity and water access to rural areas.

The country's infrastructure has also been impacted by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, which have damaged roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. To mitigate these risks, the government has implemented measures to improve the resilience of its infrastructure, including the use of seismic-resistant construction materials and the development of early warning systems for natural disasters.

Despite these challenges, Peru's infrastructure has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in the quality and coverage of its roads, telecommunications networks, and energy systems. The country has also made efforts to promote private investment in infrastructure, including the use of public-private partnerships to finance and develop major infrastructure projects.
