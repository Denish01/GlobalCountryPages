[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Peru's healthcare system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector providing **universal access** to healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and medications, to all citizens. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. The quality of care in Peru's healthcare system can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. In general, the healthcare system in Peru is considered to be of **medium quality**, with both public and private providers offering a range of services, including specialized care and emergency services.

The public healthcare system in Peru is funded through a combination of government funding and **social security** contributions, and provides access to healthcare services for all citizens, including those who cannot afford to pay. However, the public system is often overcrowded and understaffed, and patients may experience long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private sector offers higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost, making it more accessible to those who can afford to pay.

Despite these challenges, Peru has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including increasing access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, and improving the quality of care. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening the healthcare system, including the introduction of a new **health insurance** scheme and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.
