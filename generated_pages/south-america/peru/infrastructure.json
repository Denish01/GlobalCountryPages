  "content": "Peru's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 92% of population\nInternet Penetration: 45%\nRoad Network: 140,000 km, with 14% paved\nRail Network: 2,634 km\nMajor Airports: 10\nMajor Ports: 5\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nPeru's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has made significant investments in recent years to improve its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and airports. However, much of the infrastructure in rural areas remains underdeveloped, with limited access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The Peruvian government has implemented various initiatives to address these disparities, including programs to expand electricity and water access to rural areas.\n\nThe country's infrastructure has also been impacted by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, which have damaged roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. To mitigate these risks, the government has implemented measures to improve the resilience of its infrastructure, including the use of seismic-resistant construction materials and the development of early warning systems for natural disasters.\n\nDespite these challenges, Peru's infrastructure has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in the quality and coverage of its roads, telecommunications networks, and energy systems. The country has also made efforts to promote private investment in infrastructure, including the use of public-private partnerships to finance and develop major infrastructure projects.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 140,000 km | Good in urban areas, poor in rural areas | 14% paved, with plans to expand paved network |\n| Railways | 2,634 km | Moderate | Limited freight and passenger services, with plans to expand |\n| Airports | 10 international, 15 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, with plans to expand capacity |\n| Ports | 5 major | Good | Modern facilities, with plans to expand capacity and improve efficiency |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Peru's power generation is primarily based on **hydroelectric** and **natural gas** sources, with a growing share of **renewable energy** sources such as wind and solar.\n- The country's electricity grid is generally reliable, with an average of 2-3 hours of **power outages** per year.\n- Peru has made significant progress in expanding electricity access to rural areas, with a focus on **off-grid** solutions such as solar home systems.\n- The country has set ambitious targets to increase its use of **renewable energy** sources, including a goal to generate 30% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\n- Peru's energy sector is also focused on improving **energy efficiency**, with initiatives to promote the use of energy-efficient appliances and lighting.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Peru's **tap water** is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but may be contaminated in rural areas.\n- The country's **sanitation** coverage is around 80%, with significant gaps in rural areas.\n- Peru has made progress in expanding **water access** to rural areas, with a focus on **community-based** water management systems.\n- The country has also implemented initiatives to improve **water quality**, including the construction of new **wastewater treatment** plants.\n- Peru's **water management** systems are also focused on promoting **water conservation**, with initiatives to reduce water waste and promote efficient use of water resources.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Peru's **mobile coverage** is around 90%, with significant gaps in rural areas.\n- The country's **fiber-optic** network is expanding rapidly, with a focus on connecting urban and rural areas.\n- Peru has launched **4G** services in major cities, with plans to expand coverage to rural areas.\n- The country's **postal services** are also being modernized, with a focus on improving delivery times and expanding services to rural areas.\n- Peru's **telecommunications** sector is also focused on promoting **digital inclusion**, with initiatives to expand access to internet and digital services to rural and disadvantaged communities.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- Peru is investing heavily in the construction of new **roads** and **highways**, including the expansion of the **Pan-American Highway**.\n- The country is also developing new **airports**, including a major new **international airport** in Lima.\n- Peru has launched initiatives to expand **electricity access** to rural areas, including the use of **off-grid** solutions such as solar home systems.\n- The country is also investing in the development of new **ports** and **logistics** facilities, including the expansion of the **Port of Callao**.\n- Peru's **water management** systems are also being upgraded, with a focus on improving **water quality** and **water conservation**.",
