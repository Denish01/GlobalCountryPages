The majority of expats in South Georgia are British citizens, and they are typically employed by the British government or by organizations involved in scientific research, fishing, or tourism. The quality of life in South Georgia is rugged and challenging, with limited access to amenities and services, but it can also be very rewarding for those who are able to adapt to the harsh climate and remote location.\n\nThe population of South Georgia is very small, with only a handful of residents living on the island at any given time. The island has no indigenous population, and the only people living there are expats and scientists who are temporarily stationed on the island. Despite the challenges, many expats find the experience of living in South Georgia to be incredibly rewarding, with opportunities to experience the island's unique wildlife and landscapes, and to contribute to important scientific research and conservation efforts.\n\nThe expat community in South Georgia is very small and close-knit, with most residents living and working together at the British research station at King Edward Point. The community is typically made up of scientists, researchers, and support staff, as well as a few officials and administrators. The quality of life in South Georgia is generally good, with access to basic amenities and services, but it can be limited by the island's remote location and harsh climate.\n\n[SECTION] Visa & Residency Options [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Visa Type | Duration | Requirements | Cost (USD) | Path to PR? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tourist | Up to 3 months | Valid passport, proof of onward travel | $0 | No |\n| Work Visa | Up to 2 years | Job offer, valid passport, medical certificate | $500 | Yes |\n| Business/Investor | Up to 2 years | Business plan, proof of funds, valid passport | $1,000 | Yes |\n| Retirement | Up to 2 years | Proof of pension, valid passport, medical certificate | $500 | No |\n| Student | Up to 1 year | Letter of acceptance, valid passport, proof of funds | $0 | No |\n| Digital Nomad | Not available | Not available | Not available | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Relocation Checklist [/SECTION]\n1.
