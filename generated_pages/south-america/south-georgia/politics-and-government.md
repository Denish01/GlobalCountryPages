[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of South Georgia is based on the principles of a **constitutional monarchy**, with the British monarch serving as the head of state. The Commissioner of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, appointed by the British monarch, represents the UK government and is responsible for the administration of the territory. The government is unitary, with the Commissioner having significant powers to make decisions on behalf of the territory. There is no elected legislature, and the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Council serves as an advisory body.

The **separation of powers** is not clearly defined in South Georgia, as the Commissioner has a significant amount of authority. However, the UK government is responsible for ensuring that the territory is governed in accordance with the principles of democracy and human rights. The government of South Georgia is also subject to the **British Nationality Act**, which grants British citizenship to residents of the territory.

The **unitary system** of government in South Georgia means that the Commissioner has a high degree of control over the territory's affairs. This is due in part to the territory's small population and lack of economic development. The government of South Georgia is responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, as well as managing the territory's natural resources.
