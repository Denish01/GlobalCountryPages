[SECTION] Overview: South Georgia vs Antarctica [/SECTION]
South Georgia, a British overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean, has a unique economy driven by fishing, tourism, and government spending. The cost of living in South Georgia is relatively high due to its remote location, limited accessibility, and dependence on imports. In contrast, Antarctica, the frozen continent, has no permanent residents, only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations, which makes it difficult to determine a traditional cost of living. However, the cost of living in Antarctica is generally lower for those who live and work there, as many expenses, such as housing and food, are covered by their employers or governments.

The economic context of South Georgia and Antarctica is vastly different, with South Georgia having a small but functional economy, while Antarctica has no formal economy. The cost of living in South Georgia is around 10-20% higher than in the United Kingdom, while Antarctica's cost of living is not directly comparable. However, for those who live and work in Antarctica, the cost of living is often subsidized, making it relatively affordable. Overall, South Georgia is more expensive than Antarctica, but the difference in cost of living is not as significant as it would be between two countries with traditional economies.
