[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in South Georgia is a mix of public and private providers, with the British military providing medical services to residents and visitors, and private companies offering additional services. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality, but it is limited in its capacity and range of services, and most medical procedures and specialist care require evacuation to the Falkland Islands or the UK. For locals, the healthcare system is generally free or low-cost, but foreigners may be required to pay for services or have insurance that covers them.

The healthcare system in South Georgia is not well-suited to handle complex medical cases, and most serious medical conditions require evacuation to a better-equipped facility. As a result, it is highly recommended that visitors and residents have comprehensive health insurance that covers evacuation and medical care in other countries. Additionally, the remote location of South Georgia means that medical services and supplies may be limited, and visitors should be prepared for delays or difficulties in accessing medical care.
