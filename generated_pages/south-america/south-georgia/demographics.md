[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population size of South Georgia is extremely small, with only a handful of people living on the island at any given time. The population growth rate is zero, as there is no natural growth or permanent settlement on the island. The population is entirely transient, consisting of scientists, researchers, and support staff who live and work on the island for temporary periods. The urban population is 100%, as the entire population lives at the King Edward Point research station, which is the only permanent settlement on the island. The population density is extremely low, at approximately 0.005 people per square kilometer.

The population of South Georgia is characterized by a high level of mobility, with people arriving and departing on a regular basis. The island has no indigenous population, and the only people who live there are those who are employed at the research station or are supporting the research efforts. The population is highly educated, with most people holding advanced degrees in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The population is also highly skilled, with many people having expertise in areas such as research, conservation, and logistics.

The migration patterns to and from South Georgia are highly unusual, with people typically arriving on the island by ship or air. The island has no permanent residents, and everyone who lives there is a temporary resident. The population is highly dependent on external support, with all supplies and equipment being shipped in from elsewhere.
