[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
South Georgia is a British overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean, with a unique economy that is shaped by its remote location and fragile environment. The economy is classified as high-income, with a strong focus on conservation and sustainable development. The territory has a relatively low level of economic development, with a small population and limited infrastructure, but it has a high standard of living due to the presence of British government services and subsidies. The economy is also driven by a growing tourism industry, which is focused on adventure travel and wildlife viewing.

The economy of South Georgia is also influenced by its history as a former whaling and sealing station, with many abandoned buildings and artifacts remaining from this period. However, the territory has undergone significant conservation efforts in recent years, with the aim of protecting its unique and fragile environment. This has included the eradication of invasive species, such as rats and reindeer, and the restoration of native habitats. As a result, the economy of South Georgia is now focused on sustainable development and conservation, with a strong emphasis on environmental protection.

The development trajectory of South Georgia's economy is likely to be shaped by its unique environment and remote location. The territory is expected to continue to rely on government subsidies and services, as well as income from tourism and fishing. However, there are also opportunities for growth and development in areas such as renewable energy and eco-tourism, which could help to reduce the territory's reliance on external support and promote sustainable development.
