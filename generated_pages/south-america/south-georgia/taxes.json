However, as a British overseas territory, South Georgia's tax laws are ultimately governed by the United Kingdom, which follows a **worldwide taxation** principle for its citizens and residents. This means that individuals who are considered tax residents of South Georgia may still be subject to tax on their worldwide income, depending on their individual circumstances. Residency rules for tax purposes in South Georgia are based on physical presence, with individuals who spend more than 183 days in the territory in a tax year considered tax residents.\n\nThe tax system in South Georgia is relatively simple, with no **value-added tax (VAT)** or **goods and services tax (GST)**, and no **capital gains tax**. The territory's tax laws are designed to support its small economy, which is primarily based on fishing and tourism. As a result, the tax system is geared towards encouraging investment and economic growth, rather than generating significant revenue.\n\n[SECTION] Personal Income Tax [/SECTION]\n| Income Bracket (GBP) | Tax Rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 - 12,000 | 0% |\n| 12,001 - 50,000 | 20% |\n| 50,001 - 150,000 | 40% |\n| 150,001 - 500,000 | 45% |\n| 500,001 and above | 45% |\n\nPersonal income tax in South Georgia is based on a **progressive tax system**, with higher income earners paying a higher tax rate.
