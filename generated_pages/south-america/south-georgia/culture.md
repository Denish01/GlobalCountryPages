# South Georgia Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

South Georgia's culture is shaped by its unique history as a British overseas territory, its remote location in the South Atlantic, and the influences of its small but diverse community of residents and visitors.

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
South Georgia's cultural identity is defined by its strong sense of community and resilience, shaped by the challenges of living in a remote and inhospitable environment. The territory's history as a British whaling and sealing station has left a lasting legacy, with many residents tracing their ancestry back to British, Scottish, and Irish settlers. The community is small, with a population of less than 100 people, and is made up of scientists, researchers, and support staff from the British Antarctic Survey, as well as a few families who have lived on the island for generations. English is the primary language spoken, and the territory's cultural identity is closely tied to that of the United Kingdom.

The cultural influences on South Georgia are diverse, reflecting the territory's history as a stopping point for ships traveling between Europe and the Antarctic. The territory has been visited by people from all over the world, including sailors, scientists, and adventurers, and this has left a lasting impact on the local culture. Despite its small size, South Georgia has a distinct cultural identity that is shaped by its unique history, geography, and community.

The ethnic and linguistic makeup of South Georgia is predominantly British, with many residents holding British citizenship. However, the territory's remote location and limited accessibility mean that it is not uncommon for residents to spend extended periods of time on the island, and this has created a strong sense of community and camaraderie among those who live and work there.
