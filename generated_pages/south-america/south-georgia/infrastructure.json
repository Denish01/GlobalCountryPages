  "content": "The infrastructure in South Georgia is relatively underdeveloped, with limited access to roads, power, and water, primarily due to its remote location and harsh climate. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population (limited to research stations and settlements)\nInternet Penetration: 100% (limited to research stations and settlements)\nRoad Network: 40 km, poor quality (mainly dirt tracks and rough terrain)\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1 (King Edward Point)\nMajor Ports: 2 (King Edward Point and Grytviken)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSouth Georgia's infrastructure is largely limited to supporting the island's research stations, settlements, and tourism industry. The territory's infrastructure development level is relatively low, with recent investments focused on upgrading existing facilities and improving access to basic services. However, there is a significant urban vs rural gap, with most infrastructure concentrated in the capital, King Edward Point, and the former whaling station of Grytviken. The lack of infrastructure development is largely due to the island's remote location, harsh climate, and limited population.\n\nThe Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, in conjunction with the UK, has made efforts to improve infrastructure, including the construction of new buildings, upgrading of existing facilities, and implementation of renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, the island's infrastructure remains underdeveloped, and access to basic services is often limited. The island's economy is primarily driven by tourism, with a growing number of visitors each year, which has led to increased investment in infrastructure, including the development of new tourist facilities and the improvement of existing ones.\n\nThe infrastructure in South Georgia is also influenced by the island's unique environment and conservation status. The island is a **protected area**, with a strong focus on **conservation** and **sustainability**. As a result, infrastructure development is carefully managed to minimize the impact on the island's fragile ecosystem. This approach has helped to preserve the island's unique wildlife and natural beauty, making it an attractive destination for tourists and researchers alike.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 40 km | Poor | Mainly dirt tracks and rough terrain, limited to research stations and settlements |\n| Railways | none | - | No railway network on the island |\n| Airports | 1 international, 0 domestic | Good | King Edward Point airport serves as the main entry point for visitors and researchers |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | King Edward Point and Grytviken ports serve as the main entry points for ships and cargo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The primary source of power generation is **diesel generators**, which provide electricity to research stations and settlements.\n- The reliability of the power supply is generally good, with **back-up generators** in place to ensure continuity of service.\n- There are occasional **power outages** due to equipment failures or maintenance, but these are typically short-lived.\n- The use of **renewable energy sources**, such as wind and solar power, is being explored to reduce the island's reliance on diesel generators.\n- The Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is working to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the island's energy sector, with a focus on reducing **carbon emissions** and promoting **energy conservation**.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is generally good, with water treatment facilities in place to ensure the quality of drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with most research stations and settlements relying on **septic tanks** or **chemical toilets**.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is limited, with many areas relying on **rainwater collection** or **hauled water**.\n- The Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is working to improve access to **safe drinking water** and **sanitation facilities**, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Waste management** is a significant challenge, with limited facilities for **waste disposal** and a focus on **reducing waste** through **recycling** and **composting**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is limited, with no **cellular network** available on the island.\n- **Fiber/broadband** internet is available at research stations and settlements, with **satellite internet** providing connectivity to the outside world.\n- There are no plans for a **4G/5G rollout** on the island, due to the limited population and lack of commercial demand.\n- **Postal services** are limited, with mail delivered to the island on a **monthly basis**.\n- The Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is working to improve **telecommunications infrastructure**, with a focus on **enhancing connectivity** and **promoting digital inclusion**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **King Edward Point redevelopment project** aims to upgrade the island's research station and improve access to basic services.\n- The **Grytviken restoration project** focuses on restoring the former whaling station and promoting **sustainable tourism**.\n- The **South Georgia renewable energy project** aims to reduce the island's reliance on diesel generators and promote the use of **renewable energy sources**.\n- The **South Georgia water and sanitation project** aims to improve access to **safe drinking water** and **sanitation facilities**, particularly in rural areas.\n- The **South Georgia telecommunications project** aims to enhance **connectivity** and **promote digital inclusion** on the island.",
