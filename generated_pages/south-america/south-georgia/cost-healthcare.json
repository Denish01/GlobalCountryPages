  "content": "The cost of healthcare in South Georgia is relatively high due to its remote location and limited medical facilities, with most medical services and procedures being provided by the British military or private companies, and prices varying greatly depending on the type of care and provider.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: Not available\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: Not available\nHealthcare System: Public / Private\nEmergency Number: 999\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: GBP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in South Georgia is a mix of public and private providers, with the British military providing medical services to residents and visitors, and private companies offering additional services. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality, but it is limited in its capacity and range of services, and most medical procedures and specialist care require evacuation to the Falkland Islands or the UK. For locals, the healthcare system is generally free or low-cost, but foreigners may be required to pay for services or have insurance that covers them.\n\nThe healthcare system in South Georgia is not well-suited to handle complex medical cases, and most serious medical conditions require evacuation to a better-equipped facility. As a result, it is highly recommended that visitors and residents have comprehensive health insurance that covers evacuation and medical care in other countries. Additionally, the remote location of South Georgia means that medical services and supplies may be limited, and visitors should be prepared for delays or difficulties in accessing medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Limited availability |\n| Specialist Consultation | $100-$200 | $200-$500 | Often requires evacuation |\n| Dental Checkup | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Limited availability |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Limited availability |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Limited availability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | Limited availability |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | Limited availability |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Often requires evacuation |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$5,000 | Often requires evacuation |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Limited availability |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Limited availability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, basic medical care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist care, evacuation, hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Comprehensive medical care, evacuation, hospital stays |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication is often in short supply, and visitors should bring their own medication if possible.\n- Over-the-counter medication is limited, and visitors should bring their own supplies if possible.\n- Pharmacy services are limited, and visitors may need to rely on medical personnel for prescription medication.\n- Common medication prices are similar to those in the UK, but availability may be limited.\n- Prescription rules are similar to those in the UK, but medical personnel may have more discretion in prescribing medication due to the remote location.\n- Visitors should be prepared for delays or difficulties in accessing medication, and should bring their own supplies if possible.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, visitors should call 999 or contact the British military or local authorities for assistance.
