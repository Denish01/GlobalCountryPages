  "content": "Paraguay is governed as a **unitary presidential constitutional republic**, with a system that separates powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Presidential Constitutional Republic\nHead of State: President of Paraguay, Mario Abdo Benítez\nHead of Government: President of Paraguay, Mario Abdo Benítez\nLegislature: Congress of Paraguay, bicameral with 80 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 45 seats in the Senate\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: ranked 66th out of 178 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: ranked 137th out of 180 countries in the 2022 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Paraguay is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the Head of State and the Head of Government. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to two consecutive terms. The **legislative branch** is a bicameral Congress, composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies has 80 members, elected by proportional representation for a five-year term, while the Senate has 45 members, also elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court of Justice and lower courts.\n\nThe system of government in Paraguay is designed to provide a balance of power among the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the others. The Constitution of Paraguay, which was adopted in 1992, establishes the framework for the government and guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms to citizens. The government is unitary, meaning that power is centralized in the national government, and the country is divided into 17 departments and the capital district of Asunción.\n\nThe political system in Paraguay has undergone significant changes in recent decades, particularly since the end of the **Stroessner regime** in 1989. The country has made progress in consolidating its democracy and promoting human rights, but challenges remain, including corruption, poverty, and inequality. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at promoting economic growth, improving public services, and increasing transparency and accountability.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Mario Abdo Benítez | Head of State and Government |\n| Legislative | Congress of Paraguay | President of the Congress, Óscar González Daher | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Justice | President of the Supreme Court, José Raúl Torres Kirmser | Interpretation of laws and adjudication of disputes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Colorado Party | Center-right | Mario Abdo Benítez | 42 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 17 seats in the Senate | Dominant party in Paraguayan politics |\n| Authentic Radical Liberal Party | Center-left | Efraín Alegre | 30 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 13 seats in the Senate | Main opposition party |\n| Beloved Fatherland Party | Left-wing | Pedro Almada | 3 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 1 seat in the Senate | Progressive party with a focus on social justice |\n| National Encounter Party | Center-left | Luis Alberto Castiglioni | 2 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 1 seat in the Senate | Party with a focus on social democracy |\n| Guasú Front | Left-wing | Carlos Filizzola | 2 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 1 seat in the Senate | Coalition of left-wing parties |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Paraguay is based on proportional representation, with voters electing members of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.\n- Presidential and legislative elections are held every five years, with the most recent election taking place in 2018.\n- The next presidential election is scheduled to take place in 2023.\n- Voter participation is mandatory for citizens between the ages of 18 and 60, and optional for those over 60.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Paraguay is characterized by a strong **presidential system**, with the President holding significant powers.\n- Key issues facing the government include **poverty**, **inequality**, and **corruption**, which remain significant challenges to the country's development.\n- Regional dynamics, particularly with neighboring countries such as **Argentina** and **Brazil**, play an important role in shaping Paraguay's foreign policy.\n- The country has made progress in promoting **human rights** and **democratic governance**, but challenges remain, including **impunity** and **weak institutions**.\n- Freedom indices, such as the **Freedom House** index, rank Paraguay as \"partly free\", with concerns related to **corruption**, **judicial independence**, and **media freedom**.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Paraguay is a member of various international organizations, including the **United Nations**, the **Organization of American States**, and the **Mercosur** trade bloc.\n- The country has a **strategic alliance** with the United States, with cooperation in areas such as **counter-terrorism** and **drug trafficking**.\n- Paraguay has a **border dispute** with neighboring **Bolivia**, which remains unresolved.\n- The country has a **diplomatic stance** of **non-intervention** in the affairs of other countries, with a focus on promoting **regional stability** and **cooperation**.\n- Paraguay is also a member of the **Union of South American Nations** and the **Community of Latin American and Caribbean States**, which aim to promote **regional integration** and **cooperation**.",
