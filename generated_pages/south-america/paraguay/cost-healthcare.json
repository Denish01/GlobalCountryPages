  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Paraguay can vary significantly depending on the type of care and whether you opt for public or private services, with an average health expenditure per capita of $527 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $527\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 36.3%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 141\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: PYG\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nParaguay's healthcare system is a mix of public and private services, with both options available to locals and foreigners. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer wait times and limited resources. However, it is still possible to receive good care at public hospitals, especially in larger cities like Asuncion. For foreigners, it is often recommended to opt for private healthcare services, which offer better facilities and more English-speaking staff. While health insurance is not required by law, it is highly recommended to have some form of coverage, especially for those who plan to stay in the country for an extended period.\n\nThe healthcare system in Paraguay is overseen by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and out-of-pocket payments, while the private system is funded through private insurance and out-of-pocket payments. Many Paraguayans opt for private health insurance, which can provide access to better facilities and more specialized care. For foreigners, it is often possible to purchase private health insurance that covers care in Paraguay, or to opt for international health insurance that covers care worldwide.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private clinics may have more English-speaking staff |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dentists may have more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private optometrists may have more advanced technology |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Private labs may have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals may have more modern facilities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Private clinics may have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospitals may have more advanced neonatal care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public hospital care, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private hospital care, specialist consultations, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Worldwide coverage, including care in Paraguay |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at a pharmacy with a doctor's prescription, and costs can range from $10-$50 per month.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, and costs can range from $5-$20 per item.\n- Many pharmacies are open 24 hours a day, and some may offer delivery services.\n- Some medication may be available at a lower cost at public hospitals or clinics.\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration date and packaging of medication before purchasing.\n- Pharmacies may not always have the latest or most advanced medication available, especially in smaller cities.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 141, or to go to the nearest hospital.
