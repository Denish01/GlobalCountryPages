Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the region and resources available. In contrast, private schools tend to offer higher quality education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily Spanish, but Guarani is also widely spoken and taught in some schools. Compulsory education in Paraguay lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary school, and is mandatory for all children between the ages of 5 and 17.\n\nThe availability of international schools in Paraguay is limited, but there are a few institutions that offer international curricula, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). These schools tend to cater to expat families and offer a more diverse and international education experience. However, the cost of attending an international school in Paraguay can be quite high, ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 per year, depending on the institution and the level of education.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on region and resources |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range depends on tier and quality of institution |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on region and resources |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range depends on tier and quality of institution |\n| International School | $2,000-$10,000 | Offers international curricula, such as IB or CIE |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | National University of Asuncion is a top-ranked institution |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The quality of education in Paraguay can vary significantly depending on the institution and region, with private schools generally offering higher quality education.\n- Expats often prefer to send their children to international schools, which offer a more diverse and international education experience.\n- Scholarships are available for local and international students, but the competition can be fierce.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Paraguay, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The cost of living in Paraguay is relatively low, making it an attractive option for international students.\n- **Spanish language skills** are essential for navigating the education system in Paraguay, but many institutions also offer English language courses and programs.",
