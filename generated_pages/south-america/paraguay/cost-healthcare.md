[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Paraguay's healthcare system is a mix of public and private services, with both options available to locals and foreigners. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer wait times and limited resources. However, it is still possible to receive good care at public hospitals, especially in larger cities like Asuncion. For foreigners, it is often recommended to opt for private healthcare services, which offer better facilities and more English-speaking staff. While health insurance is not required by law, it is highly recommended to have some form of coverage, especially for those who plan to stay in the country for an extended period.

The healthcare system in Paraguay is overseen by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, which is responsible for providing healthcare services to the population. The public healthcare system is funded through a combination of government funding and out-of-pocket payments, while the private system is funded through private insurance and out-of-pocket payments. Many Paraguayans opt for private health insurance, which can provide access to better facilities and more specialized care. For foreigners, it is often possible to purchase private health insurance that covers care in Paraguay, or to opt for international health insurance that covers care worldwide.
