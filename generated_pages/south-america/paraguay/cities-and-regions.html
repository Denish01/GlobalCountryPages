        <h2>How Paraguay Is Divided</h2>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Paraguay has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with limited domestic flights and no railways. The primary mode of transportation is by bus, with several companies operating routes between major cities and towns. The road network is extensive, but the condition of roads can vary greatly, with some rural areas having unpaved or poorly maintained roads. Driving in Paraguay can be challenging, especially during the rainy season, when roads may become impassable. However, the country's scenic landscapes and picturesque countryside make it a rewarding destination for those willing to explore by car or bus.</p>
        <p>For travelers, the best option is often to use bus services, which are frequent and relatively affordable. Several companies operate bus routes, including long-distance services between major cities and shorter routes between towns and villages. Taxis and colectivos (shared taxis) are also available in urban areas, providing a convenient and affordable way to get around. With some planning and patience, visitors can navigate Paraguay's transportation network and discover the country's hidden gems.</p>
