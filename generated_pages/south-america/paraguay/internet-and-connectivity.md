[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Paraguay has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with average internet speeds increasing to 10 Mbps download. However, there is still a notable urban-rural divide, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in cities like Asuncion, compared to rural areas where speeds can be slower and more prone to outages. Despite this, the overall internet quality in Paraguay is relatively good, with most users able to access basic online services like social media, email, and news websites without major issues.

In terms of reliability, the internet in Paraguay is generally stable, with occasional outages and slowdowns during peak hours or in areas with high demand. However, these issues are relatively rare, and most users can expect to have a consistent and reliable internet connection. It's worth noting that Paraguay has made significant investments in its telecommunications infrastructure, including the deployment of fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile network coverage, which has helped to improve the overall quality and reliability of the internet.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Paraguay, you can visit a store or kiosk of one of the main carriers, such as Tigo, Claro, or Personal. You will typically need to provide a valid passport and proof of address, as well as pay a small fee for the SIM card, which can cost around 10 USD. Recommended carriers for tourists include Tigo and Claro, which offer a range of data plans and prepaid options. Data plans can be purchased at various denominations, with prices starting from around 5 USD for a basic plan with limited data.

You can also purchase SIM cards at airports, bus stations, and other tourist areas, making it relatively easy to get connected as soon as you arrive in the country. It's a good idea to check the coverage and data speeds of each carrier before purchasing a SIM card, as well as to read reviews and ask for recommendations from other travelers or locals.
