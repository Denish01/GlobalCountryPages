[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Paraguay's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a strong focus on improving its transportation networks and energy sector. Recent investments have been made to upgrade the country's roads, including the construction of new highways and the rehabilitation of existing ones. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address these disparities, including the implementation of programs to expand electricity access and improve water and sanitation services.

The country's infrastructure has also been impacted by its landlocked location, which increases the cost and complexity of transporting goods and people. Despite these challenges, Paraguay has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in infrastructure reaching record levels. The government has also implemented policies to attract foreign investment and promote public-private partnerships, which are expected to play a key role in the development of the country's infrastructure.

Paraguay's infrastructure is also being shaped by its strategic location in the heart of South America, with the country serving as a key transit point for trade between neighboring countries. The government has recognized the importance of developing its infrastructure to take advantage of this location, and has launched several initiatives to improve the country's competitiveness and attract foreign investment.
