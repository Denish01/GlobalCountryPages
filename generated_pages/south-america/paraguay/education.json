  "content": "Paraguay's education system is a mix of public and private institutions, with a strong emphasis on bilingual education in Spanish and Guarani, offering various opportunities for local and international students to study in the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 95.5%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Spanish\nAcademic Calendar: March to December\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 1000 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Paraguay is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **basic education**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 14 and consists of six years of primary school and six years of secondary school. The quality of education in Paraguay has improved significantly over the years, with the government investing heavily in education infrastructure and teacher training. However, there is still a significant gap between public and private schools, with private schools generally offering better facilities and more qualified teachers. Public schools are free and open to all, but private schools are often preferred by those who can afford them, as they offer a more rigorous academic environment and better preparation for university entrance exams.\n\nThe secondary education level, also known as **medium education**, is divided into two cycles: the first cycle includes students from 15 to 17 years old, and the second cycle includes students from 18 to 19 years old. At the end of the secondary education level, students take a national exam to determine their eligibility for tertiary education. Tertiary education, also known as **higher education**, is offered by universities and other institutions, and it is not compulsory. The **National University of Asunción** is the largest and most prestigious university in the country, offering a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs.\n\nDespite the progress made in recent years, the education system in Paraguay still faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including teacher training programs, school construction projects, and the introduction of new technologies in the classroom.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
