  "content": "Paraguay's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 65%\nRoad Network: 32,059 km, with 54% paved\nRail Network: 441 km\nMajor Airports: 4 international, 10 domestic\nMajor Ports: 2 major, with access to the Paraná River\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nParaguay's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a strong focus on improving its transportation networks and energy sector. Recent investments have been made to upgrade the country's roads, including the construction of new highways and the rehabilitation of existing ones. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address these disparities, including the implementation of programs to expand electricity access and improve water and sanitation services.\n\nThe country's infrastructure has also been impacted by its landlocked location, which increases the cost and complexity of transporting goods and people. Despite these challenges, Paraguay has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in infrastructure reaching record levels. The government has also implemented policies to attract foreign investment and promote public-private partnerships, which are expected to play a key role in the development of the country's infrastructure.\n\nParaguay's infrastructure is also being shaped by its strategic location in the heart of South America, with the country serving as a key transit point for trade between neighboring countries. The government has recognized the importance of developing its infrastructure to take advantage of this location, and has launched several initiatives to improve the country's competitiveness and attract foreign investment.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 32,059 km | Moderate | 54% paved, with many rural roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 441 km | Poor | Limited cargo and passenger services, with plans for rehabilitation |\n| Airports | 4 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, with several airports undergoing expansion |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Access to the Paraná River, with plans for expansion and modernization |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Paraguay's power generation is primarily based on **hydroelectric** sources, with the Itaipu Dam being one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world.\n- The country has a relatively high level of electricity access, with 99% of the population having access to electricity.\n- However, the reliability of the electricity supply can be a challenge, with frequent **outages** and voltage fluctuations.\n- Paraguay has made significant progress in recent years in terms of **renewable energy**, with several solar and wind power projects being developed.\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, including the implementation of energy-saving measures and the promotion of **energy-efficient** technologies.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** safety is a concern in Paraguay, with many households relying on alternative sources of water such as wells and rivers.\n- Sanitation coverage is also a challenge, with many rural communities lacking access to basic sanitation services.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water access** in rural areas, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the rehabilitation of existing ones.\n- **Wastewater treatment** is also a priority, with several projects being implemented to improve the treatment and disposal of wastewater.\n- The country has made significant progress in recent years in terms of **hygiene and sanitation**, with several programs being implemented to promote hygiene and sanitation practices.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Paraguay, with several operators providing services across the country.\n- **Fiber optic** networks are being expanded, with several projects being implemented to improve broadband access.\n- The rollout of **4G** and **5G** services is underway, with several operators having launched commercial services.\n- **Postal services** are also available, with several companies providing mail and package delivery services.\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote **digital inclusion**, including the implementation of programs to provide access to computers and internet services to low-income households.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a major **highway construction** program, with several new highways being built to improve connectivity and reduce transportation costs.\n- A new **international airport** is being built in Asunción, with several airlines having announced plans to launch new routes to the country.\n- The **Itaipu Dam** is being expanded, with several new turbines being installed to increase power generation capacity.\n- The government has launched a **rural electrification** program, with several projects being implemented to provide electricity access to rural communities.\n- A new **water treatment plant** is being built in Asunción, with several other projects being implemented to improve water and sanitation services across the country.",
