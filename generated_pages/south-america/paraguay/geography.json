It is situated between Argentina to the south and southeast, Bolivia to the north, and Brazil to the east and northeast. The country is bordered by these three countries, with no direct access to the ocean. The Paraguay River, which flows through the center of the country, is the main waterway and provides a connection to the Atlantic Ocean via the Paraná River.\n\nThe country's strategic location makes it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region. The capital city, Asunción, is located on the banks of the Paraguay River and is the country's largest city. The border with Argentina is marked by the Pilcomayo River, while the border with Bolivia is marked by the Parapetí River. The border with Brazil is the longest, stretching for over 1,290 kilometers. The unique location of Paraguay, surrounded by three large countries, has shaped its history, culture, and economy.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nParaguay's terrain is diverse, with a mix of grasslands, forests, and mountains.

The Chaco is a dry, semi-arid region in the west, covering about 60% of the country's land area. It is characterized by grasslands, savannas, and dry forests. The Paraná Plateau is a region of rolling hills and mountains, covering about 20% of the country's land area. The Eastern Region is a fertile area, with a mix of forests, grasslands, and wetlands.\n\nThe country's highest point, Cerro Peró, is located in the Paraná Plateau, while the lowest point is the Paraguay River, which flows through the center of the country. The Paraguay River is the main waterway, providing a connection to the Atlantic Ocean and supporting a wide range of aquatic life.
