[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Paraguay has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on buses and taxis to get around. The quality of public transit is generally good in urban areas, with frequent bus services and affordable fares. However, in rural areas, transportation options are limited, and roads can be in poor condition. The majority of the population uses **buses** and **minibuses** to travel within cities, while **taxis** and **ride-hailing apps** are also popular options.

In Asuncion, the capital city, there is a comprehensive network of buses and minibuses that cover most areas of the city. However, the lack of a metro or subway system means that traffic congestion can be a problem during peak hours. To get around, many people also use **motorcycles** or **bicycles**, which are affordable and convenient options. Additionally, **walking** is a common mode of transport, especially in smaller towns and cities.
