While Spanish is the language of government, education, and formal communication, Guarani is widely spoken in informal settings and is an important part of Paraguayan identity. Regional dialects of Guarani can be found in different parts of the country, with some variations being more prominent than others. Minority languages, such as Portuguese, are also spoken in areas near the Brazilian border. English proficiency is relatively low in Paraguay, particularly outside of major cities like Asuncion, making it essential for visitors to learn basic phrases in Spanish and Guarani.\n\nThe use of Guarani is an essential aspect of Paraguayan culture, and it is not uncommon to hear people switching between Spanish and Guarani in the same conversation. This unique linguistic phenomenon is a result of the country's history and cultural heritage. Despite the low English proficiency, many Paraguayans are eager to learn and practice their English skills, especially among the younger population.\n\nParaguay's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the presence of indigenous languages, such as Ayoreo and Mbya, which are spoken by smaller communities in the country. These languages are an important part of Paraguay's cultural heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote their use.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hola (Spanish), Mba'eichapa (Guarani) | OH-lah, m-bah-eh-CHAH-pah | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Gracias (Spanish), Aguyje (Guarani) | GRAH-see-ahs, ah-GOO-heh |  |\n| Please | Por favor (Spanish), Ehei (Guarani) | pawr fah-VOHR, eh-HEH-ee |  |\n| Yes / No | Si / No (Spanish), Hae / Nda (Guarani) | see / noh, HAH-eh / ndah |  |\n| Excuse me | Con permiso (Spanish), Nde reiko (Guarani) | kohn pehr-MEE-soh, ndeh reh-ee-koh |  |\n| How much? | Cuánto cuesta (Spanish), Mba'e guapa (Guarani) | KWAHN-toh KWEHS-tah, m-bah-eh GWAH-pah |  |\n| Where is...? | Dónde está (Spanish), Ha nde (Guarani) | DOHN-deh eh-STAH, hah ndeh |  |\n| I don't understand | No entiendo (Spanish), Ndoikuaa (Guarani) | noh ehn-tee-EHN-doh, ndoh-ee-KWAH-ah |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Habla inglés (Spanish), Oñe'ë ingles (Guarani) | AHB-lah eeng-lee-EHZ, oh-neh-eh eeng-lee-EHZ |  |\n| Help! | Ayuda (Spanish), Ysyry (Guarani) | ah-YOO-dah, ee-SEE-ree |  |\n| Goodbye | Adiós (Spanish), Jaju (Guarani) | ah-DEE-yos, hah-HOO |  |\n| Sorry | Lo siento (Spanish), Nde jará (Guarani) | loh see-EHN-toh, ndeh hah-RAH |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Uno (Spanish), Petei (Guarani) | oo-noh, peh-TEH-ee |\n| 2 | Dos (Spanish), Mokoi (Guarani) | dohs, moh-KOH-ee |\n| 3 | Tres (Spanish), Mbohapy (Guarani) | trays, mboh-hah-PEE |\n| 4 | Cuatro (Spanish), Irundy (Guarani) | KWAH-troh, ee-roon-DEE |\n| 5 | Cinco (Spanish), Po (Guarani) | sing-koh, poh |\n| 6 | Seis (Spanish), Potei (Guarani) | says, poh-TEH-ee |\n| 7 | Siete (Spanish), Pokui (Guarani) | see-EH-teh, poh-KOO-ee |\n| 8 | Ocho (Spanish), Poaty (Guarani) | OH-choh, poh-AH-tee |\n| 9 | Nueve (Spanish), Porundy (Guarani) | nway-VAY, poh-roon-DEE |\n| 10 | Diez (Spanish), Patei (Guarani) | dee-EHZ, pah-TEH-ee |\n| 100 | Cien (Spanish), Sasõ (Guarani) | see-EHN, sah-SOH |\n| 1000 | Mil (Spanish), Su (Guarani) | meel, soo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of the local culture and language, and try to learn a few basic phrases in Guarani.\n- Use formal titles such as **señor** or **señora** when addressing older individuals.\n- Avoid using gestures that may be considered rude, such as pointing with the index finger.\n- Learn to appreciate the unique linguistic phenomenon of code-switching between Spanish and Guarani.\n- Be patient and try to understand the local accent and pronunciation.\n- Use **body language** to show respect and friendliness, such as making eye contact and smiling.\n- Avoid discussing sensitive topics such as politics or religion, especially with people you have just met.\n- Learn to **bargain** and negotiate prices, especially in markets and street vendors.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a **translation app** such as Google Translate or iTranslate to help with basic phrases and conversations.\n- Carry a **phrasebook** or dictionary to help with more complex interactions.\n- Take a **language course** or class to learn more about the Spanish and Guarani languages.\n- Use **online resources** such as language learning websites or YouTube channels to practice your language skills.\n- Consider hiring a **local guide** or interpreter to help with communication and navigation.",
