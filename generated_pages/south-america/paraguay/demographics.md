[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Paraguay's population is relatively small compared to its neighbors, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The country's population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, which is slightly higher than the average for South America. The majority of the population, around 62%, lives in urban areas, with the capital city Asuncion being the largest urban center. Urbanization has been a significant trend in Paraguay, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. However, this has also led to challenges such as overcrowding, poverty, and inequality.

The population of Paraguay is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 26.5 years. This has implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is in the workforce or nearing working age. In terms of migration patterns, Paraguay has historically been a country of emigration, with many people moving to neighboring countries such as Argentina and Brazil in search of work. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in immigration to Paraguay, particularly from neighboring countries.

Paraguay's population is also affected by its geographical location, with the country being landlocked and bordered by several large countries. This has led to challenges in terms of trade and economic development, but it has also created opportunities for regional cooperation and integration. Overall, Paraguay's population is diverse, young, and urbanizing, with a mix of challenges and opportunities that shape the country's social, economic, and cultural landscape.
