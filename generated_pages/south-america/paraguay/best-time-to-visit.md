[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Paraguay has a subtropical climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by mild temperatures, low humidity, and minimal rainfall, making it the best time to visit the country. During this period, the average temperature ranges from 18°C to 25°C (64°F to 77°F), with average highs of 28°C (82°F) and average lows of 15°C (59°F). The dry season is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and exploring the country's national parks and wildlife reserves. In contrast, the wet season, which runs from October to April, is marked by heavy rainfall, high temperatures, and increased humidity, making it more challenging to travel and enjoy outdoor activities.

The country's climate varies across different regions, with the eastern part of the country, which borders Brazil, experiencing a more humid and tropical climate, while the western part, which borders Argentina and Bolivia, has a drier and more temperate climate. The climate also affects the country's agricultural production, with the dry season being the best time for harvesting crops such as soybeans, corn, and wheat. Understanding the climate and seasons is essential for planning a trip to Paraguay, as it can significantly impact the quality of your travel experience.

Paraguay's climate and seasons also have a significant impact on the country's festivals and events calendar. Many festivals and events are held during the dry season, when the weather is more pleasant, and outdoor activities are more enjoyable. For example, the **Festival de la Musica** is held in June, while the **Feria de Asuncion** is held in August. These events showcase the country's rich cultural heritage, with traditional music, dance, and food being an integral part of the celebrations.
