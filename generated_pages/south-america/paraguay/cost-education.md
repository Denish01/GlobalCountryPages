[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Paraguay is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest and most accessible. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the region and resources available. In contrast, private schools tend to offer higher quality education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily Spanish, but Guarani is also widely spoken and taught in some schools. Compulsory education in Paraguay lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary school, and is mandatory for all children between the ages of 5 and 17.

The availability of international schools in Paraguay is limited, but there are a few institutions that offer international curricula, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). These schools tend to cater to expat families and offer a more diverse and international education experience. However, the cost of attending an international school in Paraguay can be quite high, ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 per year, depending on the institution and the level of education.
