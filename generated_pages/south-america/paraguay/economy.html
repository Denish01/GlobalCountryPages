        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Paraguay has an upper-middle income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $5,140. The country's economy is driven by a mix of agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Paraguay's economic development level is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with a strong focus on export-oriented industries. The country's economic trajectory has been steadily growing, with a GDP growth rate of around 4% per annum over the past few years. However, the economy is still vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events that can impact agricultural production.</p>
        <p>Paraguay's economy is also characterized by a large informal sector, with many small and medium-sized enterprises operating outside the formal economy. This can make it challenging for the government to collect taxes and provide public services to all citizens. Despite these challenges, Paraguay has made significant progress in recent years in terms of economic development, with poverty rates declining and living standards improving. The country has also made efforts to diversify its economy, with a growing focus on industries such as tourism and technology.</p>
        <p>Paraguay's economic classification as an upper-middle income country reflects its relatively high level of economic development compared to other countries in the region. The country has a strong and stable financial system, with a well-developed banking sector and a growing stock market. However, the economy is still heavily reliant on a few key industries, such as agriculture and manufacturing, and is vulnerable to external shocks.</p>
