[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main entry point to Paraguay is the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport (ASU) in Asuncion, which receives flights from major hubs in South America, such as Buenos Aires, Santiago, and Sao Paulo. You can also enter Paraguay overland from neighboring countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil, via bus or car. The most common overland entry points are at the border towns of Ciudad del Este, Pedro Juan Caballero, and Salto del Guaira.

If you're planning to fly to Paraguay, you can check with airlines such as LATAM, Copa Airlines, and Gol Transportes Aereos for direct flights from major hubs in South America. Alternatively, you can take a bus or drive from neighboring countries, which can be a more affordable and scenic option. The bus ride from Buenos Aires to Asuncion, for example, takes around 18 hours and costs around $50-$100 USD.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Paraguay has a limited domestic air network, with only a few airlines operating flights within the country. The main domestic airlines are LATAM Paraguay and Paranair, which offer flights from Asuncion to other major cities such as Ciudad del Este and Pedro Juan Caballero. You can book domestic flights online through the airlines' websites or at a local travel agency. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100-$300 USD, depending on the route and time of booking. It's recommended to book in advance to secure the best prices.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Paraguay does not have a rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. However, there are plans to build a new rail line connecting Asuncion to the border town of Encarnacion, which could potentially offer a new transportation option in the future.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Buses are a popular and affordable way to get around Paraguay, with several companies operating intercity routes. The main bus companies are Nuestra Señora de Asunción, Expreso Guarani, and Crucero del Norte, which offer daily departures from Asuncion to other major cities. The quality of buses varies, but most companies offer comfortable and air-conditioned vehicles. Costs for bus tickets range from $10-$50 USD, depending on the route and class of service.
