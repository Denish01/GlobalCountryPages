The country's economy is driven by a mix of agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Paraguay's economic development level is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with a strong focus on export-oriented industries. The country's economic trajectory has been steadily growing, with a GDP growth rate of around 4% per annum over the past few years. However, the economy is still vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events that can impact agricultural production.\n\nParaguay's economy is also characterized by a large informal sector, with many small and medium-sized enterprises operating outside the formal economy. This can make it challenging for the government to collect taxes and provide public services to all citizens. Despite these challenges, Paraguay has made significant progress in recent years in terms of economic development, with poverty rates declining and living standards improving. The country has also made efforts to diversify its economy, with a growing focus on industries such as tourism and technology.\n\nParaguay's economic classification as an upper-middle income country reflects its relatively high level of economic development compared to other countries in the region. The country has a strong and stable financial system, with a well-developed banking sector and a growing stock market. However, the economy is still heavily reliant on a few key industries, such as agriculture and manufacturing, and is vulnerable to external shocks.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Soybeans, corn, wheat, and cotton are major crops, with a growing focus on organic and specialty products |\n| Manufacturing | 25% of GDP | Textiles, food processing, and metal products are major sectors, with a growing focus on exports to neighboring countries |\n| Services | 55% of GDP | Financial services, tourism, and logistics are major sectors, with a growing focus on IT and business process outsourcing |\n| Mining | 5% of GDP | Iron ore, limestone, and marble are major minerals, with a growing focus on exploration and extraction |\n| Tourism | 2% of GDP | Ecotourism, cultural tourism, and adventure tourism are growing sectors, with a focus on developing sustainable tourism practices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Soybeans and soybean products, with a focus on exports to China and other Asian countries\n- Cotton and textiles, with a focus on exports to neighboring countries such as Brazil and Argentina\n- Meat and leather products, with a focus on exports to Europe and other high-value markets\n- Iron ore and other minerals, with a focus on exports to China and other countries with growing industrial sectors\n- Electricity, with a focus on exports to neighboring countries such as Brazil and Argentina\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- Machinery and equipment, with a focus on imports from China and other countries with advanced manufacturing sectors\n- Vehicles and transportation equipment, with a focus on imports from Brazil and other neighboring countries\n- Electronics and electrical equipment, with a focus on imports from China and other countries with advanced technology sectors\n- Chemicals and plastics, with a focus on imports from the United States and other countries with developed chemical industries\n- Fuel and petroleum products, with a focus on imports from neighboring countries such as Brazil and Argentina\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Brazil, with a focus on trade in agricultural products, machinery, and electronics\n- Argentina, with a focus on trade in agricultural products, energy, and manufactured goods\n- China, with a focus on trade in soybeans, iron ore, and other minerals\n- United States, with a focus on trade in machinery, electronics, and other manufactured goods\n- Chile, with a focus on trade in minerals, energy, and other natural resources\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Paraguay has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with over 30,000 kilometers of roads and a major highway system connecting the country to neighboring countries\n- The country has a growing energy sector, with a focus on hydroelectric power and other renewable energy sources\n- Internet and mobile penetration are relatively high, with over 80% of the population having access to mobile phones and over 50% having access to the internet\n- Paraguay has a major port on the Paraguay River, with a focus on trade with neighboring countries and access to the Atlantic Ocean\n- The country has several international airports, with a focus on connecting to major cities in South America and other regions\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nParaguay's economic outlook is generally positive, with a growing focus on diversification and development of new industries.
