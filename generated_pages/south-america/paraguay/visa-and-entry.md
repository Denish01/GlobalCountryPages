[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Paraguay has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter visa-free or with a visa on arrival. The country's strategic location in the heart of South America makes it an attractive destination for tourists, business travelers, and investors. As a result, Paraguay offers visa-free access to citizens of over 60 countries, including the United States, Canada, and most European nations. The maximum stay for visa-free visitors is typically 90 days, although this can vary depending on the nationality and purpose of the visit.

Paraguay's visa policy is designed to promote tourism, trade, and cultural exchange, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the country's borders. The government has implemented a range of measures to facilitate the entry of legitimate travelers, including the introduction of an electronic visa system and the expansion of visa-free access to citizens of certain countries. Despite these efforts, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change frequently, and travelers should always verify the current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Paraguay before planning their trip.
