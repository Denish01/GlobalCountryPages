However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate depending on the season and usage. During the summer months, electricity costs can increase due to higher demand for air conditioning, while water costs can rise during the dry season due to reduced supply. The Paraguayan government has implemented measures to stabilize utility costs, but prices can still vary depending on the provider and location.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Paraguay is generally good, with most providers offering reliable and efficient services. However, some areas may experience occasional power outages or water shortages, especially during periods of high demand. To mitigate these issues, the government has invested in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of renewable energy sources and the improvement of water treatment facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Tigo, Claro |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 50-100 Mbps | Tigo, Claro |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Tigo, Claro |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10-20 GB | Tigo, Claro |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Tigo, Claro |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Paraguay, it is recommended to contact the provider directly and provide proof of address and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience.\n- The best internet providers in Paraguay are Tigo and Claro, which offer fast and reliable services.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances and turn off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- Consider bundling phone and internet services to reduce costs and simplify billing.",
