The **Guarani** people, the indigenous inhabitants of Paraguay, have had a significant impact on the country's cuisine, introducing staple ingredients such as corn, cassava, and sweet potatoes. Spanish and African influences can be seen in the use of beef, chicken, and pork, as well as the adoption of dishes such as **empanadas** and **asado**. Regional variations in Paraguayan cuisine are also notable, with the eastern region being known for its **soy** and **cattle** production, while the western region is famous for its **quebracho** wood-smoked meats.\n\nParaguayan cuisine is also characterized by its use of traditional cooking methods, such as **asado**, which involves slow-cooking meat over an open flame. This method is often used to cook large cuts of meat, such as **tira de asado**, which is a popular dish in Paraguay. The country's cuisine is also known for its hearty stews and soups, such as **sopa paraguaya**, which is a thick corn bread-like dish often served with meat or cheese.\n\nThe cultural significance of food in Paraguay cannot be overstated, with mealtimes often being seen as opportunities to bring people together and strengthen social bonds. In Paraguay, it is common for families to gather together for meals, and for food to be shared among friends and neighbors. This emphasis on communal eating and sharing of food reflects the country's strong sense of community and social solidarity.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sopa Paraguaya | Main Course | Thick corn bread-like dish often served with meat or cheese | Traditional restaurants in Asuncion |\n| Asado | Main Course | Slow-cooked meat over an open flame, often served with **chimichurri** | Rural areas and traditional restaurants |\n| Milanesa | Main Course | Breaded and fried cutlet, often served with **papas arrugadas** | Restaurants in Asuncion and Ciudad del Este |\n| Payagua Mascada | Dessert | Sweet corn pudding dessert, often flavored with **vanilla** or **cinnamon** | Traditional bakeries and cafes |\n| Choripan | Street Food | Grilled sausage sandwich, often served with **chimichurri** or **salsa criolla** | Street vendors and markets |\n| Tortilla de Verde | Side Dish | Fried or boiled green corn fritters, often served with **salsa criolla** | Rural areas and traditional restaurants |\n| Locro | Main Course | Hearty corn and bean stew, often served with **carne** or **pollo** | Traditional restaurants and food markets |\n| Pastel Mandioca | Dessert | Cassava and cheese pastry, often flavored with **vanilla** or **cinnamon** | Traditional bakeries and cafes |\n| Pescado Frito | Main Course | Fried fish, often served with **tartar sauce** or **lemon** | Restaurants in coastal areas |\n| Churrasco | Main Course | Grilled steak, often served with **chimichurri** or **salsa criolla** | Steakhouses and traditional restaurants |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Choripan**: grilled sausage sandwich, often served with **chimichurri** or **salsa criolla**, $2-$3 USD\n- **Tortilla de Verde**: fried or boiled green corn fritters, often served with **salsa criolla**, $1-$2 USD\n- **Papas Arrugadas**: wrinkled potatoes, often served with **chimichurri** or **salsa criolla**, $1-$2 USD\n- **Empanadas**: meat or cheese pastries, often baked or fried, $1-$2 USD\n- **Chicharron**: fried pork rinds, often served with **salsa criolla** or **chimichurri**, $2-$3 USD\n- **Cocido**: boiled corn and bean snack, often served with **salsa criolla**, $1-$2 USD\n- **Sopaipillas**: fried dough pastry, often sprinkled with **sugar** or **cinnamon**, $1-$2 USD\n- **Buñuelos**: fried dough balls, often sprinkled with **sugar** or **cinnamon**, $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Cae Cae**: traditional Paraguayan tea, often served hot or cold, $1-$2 USD\n- **Mosto**: fresh grape juice, often served with **water** or **soda**, $2-$3 USD\n- **Pilsen**: local beer, often served cold, $2-$3 USD\n- **Cachaça**: traditional Paraguayan spirit, often served with **soda** or **juice**, $3-$5 USD\n- **Jugo de Naranja**: fresh orange juice, often served with **water** or **soda**, $2-$3 USD\n- **Agua Fresca**: fresh fruit-flavored water, often served with **sugar** or **honey**, $1-$2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Reservations**: not always necessary, but recommended for popular restaurants\n- **Dress Code**: casual, but dressy attire recommended for higher-end restaurants\n- **Tipping**: 10% is standard, but not always expected\n- **Eating Etiquette**: use utensils, keep hands clean, and respect elders\n- **Mealtime**: breakfast 7-10 am, lunch 12-2 pm, dinner 7-10 pm\n- **Sharing Food**: common to share food with others, especially in traditional settings\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional Restaurants**: try **La Parroquia** in Asuncion for traditional Paraguayan cuisine\n- **Food Markets**: visit **Mercado de Abasto** in Asuncion for fresh produce and street food\n- **Food Courts**: try **Shopping del Sol** in Asuncion for a variety of food options\n- **Street Vendors**: try **Choripan** or **Tortilla de Verde** from street vendors in Asuncion\n- **Cafes**: visit **Cafe San Blas** in Asuncion for traditional coffee and pastries\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Mercado de Abasto**: large market in Asuncion offering fresh produce, meat, and street food\n- **Feria de Artesanias**: artisan market in Asuncion offering traditional handicrafts and food\n- **Festival de la Sopa Paraguaya**: annual festival in Asuncion celebrating the country's national dish\n- **Asado Experience**: try a traditional **asado** experience in rural areas or at a local restaurant\n- **Food Tour**: take a guided food tour in Asuncion to sample the city's best cuisine and drinks",
