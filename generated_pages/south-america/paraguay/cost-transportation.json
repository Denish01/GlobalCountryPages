The quality of public transit is generally good in urban areas, with frequent bus services and affordable fares. However, in rural areas, transportation options are limited, and roads can be in poor condition. The majority of the population uses **buses** and **minibuses** to travel within cities, while **taxis** and **ride-hailing apps** are also popular options.\n\nIn Asuncion, the capital city, there is a comprehensive network of buses and minibuses that cover most areas of the city. However, the lack of a metro or subway system means that traffic congestion can be a problem during peak hours. To get around, many people also use **motorcycles** or **bicycles**, which are affordable and convenient options. Additionally, **walking** is a common mode of transport, especially in smaller towns and cities.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$25 | Good coverage in urban areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Frequent services on main routes |\n| Commuter Train | $2.00-$5.00 | $50-$100 | Limited services, mostly used for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.00-$5.00 | $1.00-$2.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3.00-$5.00 | $1.50-$3.00 | $8.00-$15.00 | Cabify, Easy Taxi available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20.00-$30.00 | To city center, approx. 30-40 minutes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Regular unleaded |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$80 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2.00-$5.00 | Limited parking options in city centers |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5.00-$10.00 | Limited toll roads, mostly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$30.00 | Frequent services, affordable fares |\n| Domestic Flight | $100.00-$300.00 | Limited routes, mostly to major cities |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20.00-$50.00 | Limited services, mostly used for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or minibuses, which are affordable and frequent.\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Cabify or Easy Taxi to book taxis or private cars, which can be more convenient than hailing a taxi on the street.\n- When taking a taxi, always **agree on the fare** before you start your journey to avoid any disputes.\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** in urban areas, especially during peak hours, and plan your journey accordingly.\n- Consider **renting a car** if you plan to explore rural areas or travel long distances, as public transportation options may be limited.\n- Always **wear a helmet** when riding a motorcycle or bicycle, and follow local traffic rules to ensure your safety.",
