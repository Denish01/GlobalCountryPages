[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Paraguay is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the Head of State and the Head of Government. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to two consecutive terms. The **legislative branch** is a bicameral Congress, composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies has 80 members, elected by proportional representation for a five-year term, while the Senate has 45 members, also elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court of Justice and lower courts.

The system of government in Paraguay is designed to provide a balance of power among the three branches, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the others. The Constitution of Paraguay, which was adopted in 1992, establishes the framework for the government and guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms to citizens. The government is unitary, meaning that power is centralized in the national government, and the country is divided into 17 departments and the capital district of Asunción.

The political system in Paraguay has undergone significant changes in recent decades, particularly since the end of the **Stroessner regime** in 1989. The country has made progress in consolidating its democracy and promoting human rights, but challenges remain, including corruption, poverty, and inequality. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at promoting economic growth, improving public services, and increasing transparency and accountability.
