[SECTION] How Paraguay Is Divided [/SECTION]
Paraguay is a sovereign country located in South America, divided into 17 departments and 1 capital district. The departments are further subdivided into districts, which are the third-level administrative divisions. This structure allows for effective governance and administration of the country's diverse regions. The capital district, which includes the city of Asuncion, is a separate entity that serves as the seat of government and the country's largest urban center.

The departments in Paraguay are primarily named after geographical features, historical events, or notable figures. Each department has its own capital city, which often serves as the economic and cultural hub of the region. The departments are responsible for providing various public services, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. This decentralization of power enables the government to address the unique needs and challenges of each region, promoting overall development and growth.
