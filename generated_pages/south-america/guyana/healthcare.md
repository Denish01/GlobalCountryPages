[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Guyana's healthcare system is structured around a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, which includes a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics. The quality of care varies, with better-equipped and staffed facilities found in urban areas, particularly in the capital city of Georgetown. In contrast, rural areas often struggle with limited access to healthcare services and a shortage of medical professionals. The public sector provides a range of services, including preventive care, diagnostic testing, and treatment for common illnesses, while private providers offer more specialized and advanced care, often at a higher cost.

The public healthcare system in Guyana is generally considered to be adequate, with a range of services available, including emergency care, surgical services, and maternal and child health programs. However, the system faces challenges, including limited resources, outdated equipment, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. In contrast, the private sector offers more advanced and specialized care, with many private hospitals and clinics equipped with modern equipment and staffed by highly trained medical professionals.

Despite these challenges, Guyana has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, including the introduction of new healthcare programs and the expansion of existing services. The government has also invested in the development of healthcare infrastructure, including the construction of new hospitals and health centers.
