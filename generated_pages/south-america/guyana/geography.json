The country's unique position at the northern edge of the continent makes it a cultural and geographical bridge between the Caribbean and South America. The capital city, **Georgetown**, is situated on the coast and serves as the country's main port and commercial center.\n\nGuyana's borders with its neighboring countries are largely defined by natural features, including the **Essequibo River** to the west and the **Corentyne River** to the east. The country's coastline along the Atlantic Ocean is relatively short, but it provides access to important shipping lanes and marine resources. The border with Venezuela has been a subject of dispute for many years, with both countries claiming sovereignty over the **Essequibo region**. Despite these challenges, Guyana maintains good relations with its neighbors and is an active member of regional organizations such as the **Caribbean Community**.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nGuyana's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including **coastal plains**, **mountain ranges**, and **interior forests**. The coastal region is generally flat and low-lying, with many **mangrove swamps** and **river deltas**. The interior of the country is dominated by the **Guiana Shield**, a vast region of **precambrian rock** that covers much of northern South America. This region is home to many **mountain ranges**, including the **Pakaraima Mountains** and the **Kanuku Mountains**.\n\nThe country's **river system** is also an important feature of its landscape, with many major rivers flowing through the interior and coastal regions. The **Essequibo River** is the largest river in Guyana, stretching over 1,000 kilometers from its source in the **Acari Mountains** to its mouth on the Atlantic coast. The **Demerara River** and the **Corentyne River** are other major rivers that flow through the country. Guyana's interior forests are also home to many **waterfalls**, including the famous **Kaieteur Falls**, which is one of the largest waterfalls in the world by volume.\n\nThe country's **coastal region** is also home to many **beaches** and **islands**, including the **Essequibo Islands** and the **Wakenaam Island**. The coastal region is also an important area for **agriculture**, with many **sugar plantations** and **rice fields**. However, the region is also vulnerable to **flooding** and **coastal erosion**, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall or storm surges.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dry Season | January to April | 24-30°C | Low | Clear skies, dry weather |\n| Wet Season | May to July | 22-28°C | High | Heavy rainfall, flooding |\n| Mini-Dry Season | August to November | 24-30°C | Medium | Variable weather, some dry spells |\n| Wet Season | December to January | 22-28°C | High | Heavy rainfall, flooding |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: February to April.
