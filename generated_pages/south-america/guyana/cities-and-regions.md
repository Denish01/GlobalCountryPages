Guyana is divided into 10 regions, each with its own administrative and economic centers.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Guyana has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with few paved roads and limited public transportation options. The country has a number of domestic airports, including the Cheddi Jagan International Airport near Georgetown, which offer flights to regional centers and interior locations. There are also bus and minibus services available, although these can be slow and unreliable. Driving is an option, but road conditions can be challenging, especially in the interior regions. The country's waterways, including the Demerara and Essequibo rivers, also play an important role in transportation, with ferry services and boat charters available to many coastal and interior locations.

Overall, getting around Guyana can be challenging, but the country's unique landscape and cultural diversity make it a rewarding destination for adventurous travelers. With some planning and flexibility, visitors can experience the country's many natural and cultural attractions, from the scenic coastlines and rainforests to the vibrant cities and rural communities. [CALLOUT] Be sure to research transportation options in advance and plan for contingencies, as services can be limited and unpredictable.
