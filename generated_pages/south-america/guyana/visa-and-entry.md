# Guyana Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Guyana before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Guyana has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visa applications for different nationalities. The country offers visa-free access to citizens of around 50 countries, including most Caribbean and Latin American nations, for stays of up to 90 days. For other nationalities, visa requirements vary, with some eligible for visa on arrival or e-visas, while others must apply for a visa in advance through the Guyanese embassy or consulate.

The visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate tourism and business travel with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration. Guyana's visa requirements are generally straightforward, but it's essential to check the current requirements before planning a trip to the country. The official government website and embassy or consulate websites provide the most up-to-date information on visa requirements and application procedures.
