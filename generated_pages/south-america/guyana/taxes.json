This can include days spent in the country for work, vacation, or other purposes. The residency rules are important for determining tax liability, as residents are subject to taxation on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on income earned within Guyana.\n\nThe tax system in Guyana is administered by the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA), which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs duties, and other revenue.
