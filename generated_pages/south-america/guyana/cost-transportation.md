[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Guyana's transportation system is relatively underdeveloped, with a lack of efficient public transportation options. The main modes of transportation in Guyana are buses, minivans, and taxis, which are often overcrowded and unreliable. Most people in Guyana rely on private vehicles or **carpooling** to get around, especially in rural areas where public transportation is scarce. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Georgetown having the most comprehensive network of buses and minivans.

The road network in Guyana is also limited, with many roads being unpaved and prone to flooding during the rainy season. This can make traveling by road challenging, especially for those who are not familiar with the terrain. Despite these challenges, the Guyanese government has been investing in improving the country's transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the public transportation system.
