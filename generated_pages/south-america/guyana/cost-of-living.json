[/SECTION]\nGuyana is considered an affordable country to live in or visit, with a cost of living that is relatively low compared to other countries in South America. The country's economy is driven by agriculture, mining, and forestry, which contributes to its affordable cost of living. Compared to its neighbors, Guyana is more affordable than Brazil but slightly more expensive than Suriname. The capital city, Georgetown, is the most expensive part of the country, but even there, the cost of living is relatively low. Overall, Guyana offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike.\n\nThe cost of living in Guyana is also influenced by the country's currency, the Guyanese dollar (GYD), which has a relatively stable exchange rate with the US dollar. This makes it easy for visitors to budget and plan their expenses. Additionally, the country's laid-back atmosphere and friendly locals add to its appeal, making it a great destination for those looking to experience the authentic culture of South America without breaking the bank.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $10-20 | Basic dorms and shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $30-60 | Air-conditioned rooms, TV, and private bath |\n| Luxury/Resort | $100-200 | High-end amenities, pool, and scenic views |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $200-500 | City center, furnished, 1-2 bedrooms |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $100-300 | Outside city center, furnished, 1-2 bedrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-20 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-40 |\n| Fine Dining | $50-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $2-5 |\n| Coffee | $1-3 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.50-1.00 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $50-100 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50-1.00 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 200 | 400 | 800 |\n| Food | 200 | 400 | 800 |\n| Transport | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Utilities | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Entertainment | 100 | 200 | 400 |\n| **Total** | **600** | **1200** | **2400** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in a hostel or guesthouse instead of a hotel to save on accommodation costs.\n- Eat at local eateries and street food stalls to experience authentic Guyanese cuisine at a lower cost.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce transport costs.\n- Shop at local markets for fresh produce and groceries instead of relying on imported goods.\n- Avoid exchanging money at airports or hotels, as the rates are often unfavorable – instead, use ATMs or local banks to withdraw cash.\n- Learn some basic Guyanese phrases and customs to show respect for the local culture and people, which can also help you negotiate better prices and make the most of your experience.",
