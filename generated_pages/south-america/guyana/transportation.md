[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Guyana has two main international airports, Cheddi Jagan International Airport (CJIA) and Ogle International Airport (OGL), with CJIA being the primary hub for international flights. Direct flights to Guyana are available from major cities such as New York, Miami, and Toronto, as well as from neighboring countries like Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname. You can also enter Guyana overland from Venezuela, Brazil, and Suriname, although this may require special permits and documentation. The main overland entry points are at Lethem, which borders Brazil, and Skeldon, which borders Suriname.

If you're planning to enter Guyana overland, it's essential to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations, as these can change frequently. Additionally, be prepared for long journeys on rough roads, and consider hiring a guide or joining a tour group to ensure a smooth and safe passage. For those flying in, CJIA is located about 40 kilometers south of Georgetown, and you can take a taxi or shuttle bus to get to the city.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Guyana has a limited domestic air network, with flights available to major towns such as Lethem, Kaieteur, and Annai. The main domestic airline is Air Guyana, although there are also smaller charter operators that offer flights to more remote areas. Booking domestic flights can be done through the airlines' websites or at local travel agencies, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year. A one-way flight from Georgetown to Lethem, for example, can cost around $100-$200 USD.

It's worth noting that domestic flights in Guyana can be affected by weather conditions, especially during the rainy season, so it's essential to check the latest flight schedules and plan ahead. Additionally, some domestic flights may require a charter or special arrangement, so be sure to research and book in advance to avoid any last-minute hassles.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Guyana has no rail network, so train travel is not an option. The country's geography and history have made it difficult to establish a rail system, and as a result, other modes of transportation have become more prominent.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Guyana has a network of buses and coaches that connect major towns and cities, although the quality of the roads and vehicles can vary greatly. Intercity bus companies such as Minibus Services and West Demerara Bus Service offer daily routes to destinations like Lethem, Bartica, and Linden, with prices ranging from $5-$20 USD for a one-way ticket. While bus travel can be a convenient and affordable option, be prepared for long journeys on rough roads and limited amenities.
