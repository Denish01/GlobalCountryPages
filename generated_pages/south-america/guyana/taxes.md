[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Guyana has a territorial tax system, which means that only income earned within the country is subject to taxation. However, residents are also taxed on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must be present in Guyana for at least 183 days in a calendar year. This can include days spent in the country for work, vacation, or other purposes. The residency rules are important for determining tax liability, as residents are subject to taxation on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on income earned within Guyana.

The tax system in Guyana is administered by the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA), which is responsible for collecting taxes, customs duties, and other revenue. The GRA also provides guidance and support to taxpayers, including individuals and businesses, to help them comply with their tax obligations. The tax system is based on a self-assessment approach, where taxpayers are required to file their tax returns and pay their taxes on time. The GRA also conducts audits and investigations to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.
