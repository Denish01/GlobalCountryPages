[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Guyana's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, and is often overcrowded and underfunded. Locals typically rely on the public system, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private care. The public system is generally free or low-cost for citizens, but foreigners may be required to pay out-of-pocket for services. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher quality care but at a significantly higher cost. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.

The healthcare system in Guyana is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for regulating and funding public healthcare services. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, operate independently and are often affiliated with international health organizations. In general, the quality of care in Guyana's private healthcare facilities is comparable to that found in other developed countries, while public facilities often struggle with limited resources and outdated equipment. As a result, those who can afford it often choose to seek medical care in private facilities, while those who cannot afford it rely on the public system.
