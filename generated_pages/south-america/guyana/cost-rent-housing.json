Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are generally protected under Guyanese law, with provisions for fair rent, maintenance, and dispute resolution. Compared to its regional neighbors, Guyana's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than those in Brazil but higher than those in Suriname. The country's economy is driven by its natural resources, including oil, gold, and timber, which has led to an influx of expatriates and a growing demand for housing.\n\nThe housing market in Guyana is also influenced by the country's geography, with the coastal region being the most densely populated and sought-after area. The capital city of Georgetown is a hub for business, culture, and entertainment, and as such, it tends to have higher rental prices and property values. However, the city's infrastructure is still developing, and amenities such as reliable water and electricity supply can be limited in some areas. Overall, the housing market in Guyana offers a range of options for renters and buyers, from modern apartments in the city center to more rustic homes in the suburbs and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $400-$600 | $200-$400 | small, basic accommodations |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$800 | $300-$600 | modern, furnished apartments |\n| 2 Bedroom | $900-$1,200 | $500-$900 | family-size, comfortable homes |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,200 | spacious, luxurious apartments |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | rustic, natural surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Bel Air**: a upscale neighborhood with modern apartments and a range of amenities, rent $800-$1,200 per month\n- **Kitty**: a vibrant neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, rent $600-$1,000 per month\n- **Subryanville**: a family-friendly neighborhood with spacious homes and a suburban feel, rent $500-$900 per month\n- **Lamaha Gardens**: a quiet neighborhood with a range of accommodations, rent $400-$800 per month\n- **Georgetown Downtown**: a bustling neighborhood with modern apartments and easy access to amenities, rent $600-$1,200 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Guyana [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find reliable and trustworthy landlords\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease to get the best deal possible\n- Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit without a signed lease agreement\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are common in Guyana, but unfurnished options are also available for those who prefer to bring their own belongings",
