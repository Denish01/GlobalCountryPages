  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Guyana can vary significantly depending on the type of care and provider, with public healthcare services generally being more affordable than private options, and health expenditure per capita standing at $505.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $505\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 26.3%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 911\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: GYD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGuyana's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private facilities, and is often overcrowded and underfunded. Locals typically rely on the public system, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private care. The public system is generally free or low-cost for citizens, but foreigners may be required to pay out-of-pocket for services. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher quality care but at a significantly higher cost. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Guyana is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for regulating and funding public healthcare services. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, operate independently and are often affiliated with international health organizations. In general, the quality of care in Guyana's private healthcare facilities is comparable to that found in other developed countries, while public facilities often struggle with limited resources and outdated equipment. As a result, those who can afford it often choose to seek medical care in private facilities, while those who cannot afford it rely on the public system.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private specialists often have more experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $15-$30 | $50-$100 | Private dentists often have more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$25 | $30-$75 | Private optometrists often have more advanced technology |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs often have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals often have limited resources |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals often have more comfortable facilities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals often have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals often have more advanced equipment |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private facilities often have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Private hospital care, specialist consultations, advanced medical services |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** are widely available at pharmacies and often cost between $5-$10 per prescription.\n- **Prescription rules** in Guyana are generally similar to those in other countries, with a doctor's prescription required for most medications.\n- Pharmacies are **widely available** in urban areas, but may be more limited in rural areas.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available and often cost between $5-$10 per package.\n- Some **specialized medications** may require a special import permit and can be more expensive.\n- It is recommended to **check with your insurance provider** to see if your medications are covered under your policy.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call 911 or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. **Ambulance services** are available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.
