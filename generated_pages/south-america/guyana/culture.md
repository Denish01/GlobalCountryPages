# Guyana Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Guyana's culture is a unique blend of its indigenous, African, European, and Asian heritage. The country's cultural identity is shaped by its history as a British colony, with English being the official language. The ethnic makeup of Guyana is diverse, with approximately 39% of the population being of East Indian descent, 30% of African descent, 20% of mixed ancestry, and 10% of indigenous descent. This diversity has created a distinct cultural landscape, with each group contributing its own customs, traditions, and practices.

The key influences on Guyana's culture include its indigenous roots, African traditions, European colonization, and Asian immigration. The country's indigenous people, such as the Wai Wai and the Makushi, have maintained their cultural practices and traditions, including their language, music, and art. African traditions, such as music and dance, have also had a significant impact on Guyana's cultural identity. The European colonization of Guyana has left a legacy of English language, Christianity, and Western customs, while Asian immigration has introduced new traditions and practices, such as Hinduism and Islam.

Guyana's cultural identity is also reflected in its linguistic makeup, with English being the primary language spoken. However, many Guyanese also speak Creole, a blend of African, European, and indigenous languages. The country's cultural diversity is celebrated through its music, art, and literature, which reflect the unique experiences and perspectives of its people. From the vibrant colors of its festivals to the rich flavors of its cuisine, Guyana's cultural identity is a true reflection of its diverse heritage.
