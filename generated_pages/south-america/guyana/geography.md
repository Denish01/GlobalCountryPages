[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Guyana is located on the northern coast of **South America**, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Venezuela to the west, Brazil to the south, and Suriname to the east. The country's unique position at the northern edge of the continent makes it a cultural and geographical bridge between the Caribbean and South America. The capital city, **Georgetown**, is situated on the coast and serves as the country's main port and commercial center.

Guyana's borders with its neighboring countries are largely defined by natural features, including the **Essequibo River** to the west and the **Corentyne River** to the east. The country's coastline along the Atlantic Ocean is relatively short, but it provides access to important shipping lanes and marine resources. The border with Venezuela has been a subject of dispute for many years, with both countries claiming sovereignty over the **Essequibo region**. Despite these challenges, Guyana maintains good relations with its neighbors and is an active member of regional organizations such as the **Caribbean Community**.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Guyana's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including **coastal plains**, **mountain ranges**, and **interior forests**. The coastal region is generally flat and low-lying, with many **mangrove swamps** and **river deltas**. The interior of the country is dominated by the **Guiana Shield**, a vast region of **precambrian rock** that covers much of northern South America. This region is home to many **mountain ranges**, including the **Pakaraima Mountains** and the **Kanuku Mountains**.

The country's **river system** is also an important feature of its landscape, with many major rivers flowing through the interior and coastal regions. The **Essequibo River** is the largest river in Guyana, stretching over 1,000 kilometers from its source in the **Acari Mountains** to its mouth on the Atlantic coast. The **Demerara River** and the **Corentyne River** are other major rivers that flow through the country. Guyana's interior forests are also home to many **waterfalls**, including the famous **Kaieteur Falls**, which is one of the largest waterfalls in the world by volume.

The country's **coastal region** is also home to many **beaches** and **islands**, including the **Essequibo Islands** and the **Wakenaam Island**. The coastal region is also an important area for **agriculture**, with many **sugar plantations** and **rice fields**. However, the region is also vulnerable to **flooding** and **coastal erosion**, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall or storm surges.
