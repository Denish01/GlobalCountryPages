The population growth rate is relatively low, at 0.6% per annum, which is attributed to a combination of factors including a declining fertility rate and emigration. The urban population accounts for approximately 28.7% of the total population, with the majority living in the capital city, Georgetown. The country has experienced significant migration patterns, with many Guyanese emigrating to countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of Guyana is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 25.5 years. This has implications for the country's economy and social services, as a significant proportion of the population is in the working-age group. However, the country also faces challenges related to emigration, with many skilled and educated individuals leaving the country in search of better opportunities.\n\nThe population density of Guyana is relatively low, at 3.6 people per square kilometer, which is one of the lowest in the region. This is due to the country's large land area and relatively small population. The life expectancy at birth is approximately 69.3 years, which is lower than the average for the region. The fertility rate is 2.4 children per woman, which is higher than the average for the region.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| East Indian | 39.8% | Coastal regions | Descendants of indentured servants from India |\n| Black/African | 29.3% | Coastal regions | Descendants of enslaved Africans |\n| Mixed | 19.9% | Urban areas | Mixed ancestry, including European, African, and indigenous |\n| Amerindian | 10.5% | Interior regions | Indigenous peoples, including the Wai Wai and Makushi |\n| Chinese | 0.7% | Urban areas | Descendants of Chinese immigrants |\n| European | 0.2% | Urban areas | Descendants of European colonizers |\n| Other | 0.6% | Urban areas | Includes people of other ethnicities, such as Portuguese and Lebanese |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity of Guyana is a significant aspect of the country's cultural identity.
