[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Guyana is relatively small, with a limited supply of high-quality accommodations, particularly in the capital city of Georgetown. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are generally protected under Guyanese law, with provisions for fair rent, maintenance, and dispute resolution. Compared to its regional neighbors, Guyana's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than those in Brazil but higher than those in Suriname. The country's economy is driven by its natural resources, including oil, gold, and timber, which has led to an influx of expatriates and a growing demand for housing.

The housing market in Guyana is also influenced by the country's geography, with the coastal region being the most densely populated and sought-after area. The capital city of Georgetown is a hub for business, culture, and entertainment, and as such, it tends to have higher rental prices and property values. However, the city's infrastructure is still developing, and amenities such as reliable water and electricity supply can be limited in some areas. Overall, the housing market in Guyana offers a range of options for renters and buyers, from modern apartments in the city center to more rustic homes in the suburbs and rural areas.
