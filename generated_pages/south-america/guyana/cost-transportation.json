The main modes of transportation in Guyana are buses, minivans, and taxis, which are often overcrowded and unreliable. Most people in Guyana rely on private vehicles or **carpooling** to get around, especially in rural areas where public transportation is scarce. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Georgetown having the most comprehensive network of buses and minivans.\n\nThe road network in Guyana is also limited, with many roads being unpaved and prone to flooding during the rainy season. This can make traveling by road challenging, especially for those who are not familiar with the terrain. Despite these challenges, the Guyanese government has been investing in improving the country's transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the expansion of the public transportation system.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $15 | Limited coverage, often overcrowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00 | N/A | Routes vary, often unreliable |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5.00 | $2.00 | $10-$15 | Often negotiated fares |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3.00 | $1.50 | $8-$12 | EasyGo and Guyana Ride available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, often pre-arranged |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, often unmanned |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, often unreliable |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, limited availability |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or minivans, which are often cheaper than taxis or ride-hailing services.\n- Use reputable taxi services or ride-hailing apps to ensure safety and avoid overcharging.\n- Negotiate fares with taxi drivers before starting your journey to avoid disputes.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep valuables secure, especially in crowded public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car or hiring a driver for long-distance travel, as public transportation options can be limited.\n- Use apps like EasyGo or Guyana Ride to book ride-hailing services, which can be more convenient and affordable than traditional taxis.",
