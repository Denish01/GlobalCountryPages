The cost of food is driven up by transportation costs, taxes, and the limited availability of certain products. However, the country's **agricultural sector** is well-developed, and many staple foods such as **rice**, **chicken**, and **vegetables** are widely available and relatively affordable. Eating out is not as common in Guyana as in other countries, and many people prefer to cook at home using fresh ingredients from local markets.\n\nIn terms of eating-out culture, Guyana has a mix of traditional and modern restaurants, with many establishments serving **Creole cuisine**, which is a unique blend of African, European, and indigenous influences. However, the **fast food** sector is also growing, with many international chains having a presence in the capital city of Georgetown. Despite the growing number of restaurants, home cooking remains the norm, and many people prefer to buy ingredients from local markets and cook traditional dishes at home.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 500 GYD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | 300 GYD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 400 GYD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 240 GYD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 1200 GYD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 2000 GYD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 1000 GYD | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 300 GYD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.20 | 240 GYD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00 | 200 GYD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 1600 GYD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.50 | 300 GYD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like cook-up rice and pepper pot soup) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person, 2 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$40 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nPrices at supermarkets and local markets in Guyana can vary significantly, with supermarkets generally being more expensive.
