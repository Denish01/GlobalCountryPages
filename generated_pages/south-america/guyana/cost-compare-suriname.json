  "content": "Guyana is generally cheaper than Suriname, with a cost of living difference of around 15-20% in favor of Guyana.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGuyana GDP per Capita (PPP): $4,610\nSuriname GDP per Capita (PPP): $6,330\nGuyana Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nSuriname Inflation Rate: 4.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Guyana\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Guyana vs Suriname [/SECTION]\nGuyana and Suriname are two neighboring countries in South America, sharing a common border and cultural heritage. However, they have distinct economic profiles, with Guyana relying heavily on agriculture and mining, while Suriname has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on services and industry. The cost of living in Guyana is generally lower than in Suriname, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being relatively cheaper. This is partly due to Guyana's lower GDP per capita and inflation rate, which contribute to a more affordable lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost of living. Guyana's economy is driven by its natural resources, including gold, bauxite, and timber, while Suriname's economy is more service-oriented, with a growing tourism sector. As a result, Suriname tends to have a more developed infrastructure and a higher standard of living, which is reflected in its higher prices. Despite this, Guyana offers a more affordable lifestyle, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a budget-friendly destination.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guyana (USD) | Suriname (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $300 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper in Guyana |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $600 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guyana (USD) | Suriname (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $10 | $15 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $300 | $400 | 25% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Coffee | $1.50 | $2.50 | 40% cheaper in Guyana |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guyana (USD) | Suriname (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1 | $1.50 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.00 | 20% cheaper in Guyana |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Guyana (USD) | Suriname (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $30 | $40 | 25% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Mobile Plan | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Guyana (USD) | Suriname (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $800 | $1,200 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Mid-Range | $1,200 | $1,800 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $3,000 | 33% cheaper in Guyana |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Guyana is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and accommodation, with prices up to 40% lower than in Suriname\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices up to 33% lower than in Suriname\n  - Transportation, with fuel prices up to 20% lower than in Suriname\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices up to 33% lower than in Suriname\n- **Suriname is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain imported goods, which may be subject to lower tariffs and taxes\n  - High-end dining and entertainment options, which may be more readily available in Suriname\n  - Tourist attractions and activities, which may be more developed in Suriname\n  - Certain types of accommodation, such as luxury hotels and resorts, which may be more competitively priced in Suriname\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nGuyana offers a more affordable lifestyle compared to Suriname, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a budget-friendly destination.
