[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Guyana are generally higher than in other countries in the region, due to the country's remote location and limited access to international trade. The cost of food is driven up by transportation costs, taxes, and the limited availability of certain products. However, the country's **agricultural sector** is well-developed, and many staple foods such as **rice**, **chicken**, and **vegetables** are widely available and relatively affordable. Eating out is not as common in Guyana as in other countries, and many people prefer to cook at home using fresh ingredients from local markets.

In terms of eating-out culture, Guyana has a mix of traditional and modern restaurants, with many establishments serving **Creole cuisine**, which is a unique blend of African, European, and indigenous influences. However, the **fast food** sector is also growing, with many international chains having a presence in the capital city of Georgetown. Despite the growing number of restaurants, home cooking remains the norm, and many people prefer to buy ingredients from local markets and cook traditional dishes at home.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
Prices at supermarkets and local markets in Guyana can vary significantly, with supermarkets generally being more expensive.
