However, there is still a significant urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in major cities like Quito and Guayaquil, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet also varies depending on the provider and the location, with some areas experiencing more frequent outages and disconnections than others.\n\nIn general, the internet quality in Ecuador is good enough for most basic tasks like browsing, emailing, and social media, but may not be sufficient for more demanding activities like online gaming or streaming. Additionally, the internet infrastructure in Ecuador is still developing, and the country faces challenges such as limited fiber-optic connectivity and a lack of investment in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the Ecuadorian government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the deployment of 5G networks in major cities.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Ecuador, you can visit a store of one of the main carriers, such as Claro, Movistar, or CNT, and provide your passport and a copy of your visa (if required).
