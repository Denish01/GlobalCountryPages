[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Ecuador has improved significantly over the past few years, with the average internet speed now reaching 10 Mbps. However, there is still a significant urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in major cities like Quito and Guayaquil, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The reliability of the internet also varies depending on the provider and the location, with some areas experiencing more frequent outages and disconnections than others.

In general, the internet quality in Ecuador is good enough for most basic tasks like browsing, emailing, and social media, but may not be sufficient for more demanding activities like online gaming or streaming. Additionally, the internet infrastructure in Ecuador is still developing, and the country faces challenges such as limited fiber-optic connectivity and a lack of investment in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the Ecuadorian government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the deployment of 5G networks in major cities.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Ecuador, you can visit a store of one of the main carriers, such as Claro, Movistar, or CNT, and provide your passport and a copy of your visa (if required). The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 10 USD, and you can choose from a variety of data plans. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a official store or a reputable vendor to avoid any scams or fake SIM cards.

You can find SIM card vendors at airports, malls, and city centers, and some carriers also offer online purchases and delivery. When purchasing a SIM card, make sure to ask about the coverage and data speeds in the areas you plan to visit, as well as any additional fees or charges.
