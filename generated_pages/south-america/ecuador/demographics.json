  "content": "Ecuador is home to a diverse population of approximately 18 million people, with a mix of indigenous, Spanish, and African influences shaping the country's demographics.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 18.0 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 1.2%\nMedian Age: 27.8 years\nUrban Population: 64%\nPopulation Density: 65 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 77.2 years\nFertility Rate: 2.4 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nEcuador's population is relatively small compared to other countries in South America, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, which is slightly higher than the regional average. The country's urban population accounts for about 64% of the total population, with the majority residing in cities such as Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca. Ecuador has a relatively young population, with a median age of 27.8 years, and a life expectancy of 77.2 years. The country's population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with many people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities.\n\nThe population growth rate in Ecuador is influenced by factors such as fertility rates, mortality rates, and migration patterns. The country's fertility rate is approximately 2.4 children per woman, which is higher than the regional average. However, the fertility rate has been declining in recent years, particularly among urban women. Ecuador also has a significant diaspora community, with many Ecuadorians living abroad, particularly in the United States, Spain, and Italy.\n\nEcuador's population is also characterized by a significant rural-urban divide. The country's rural areas are often disadvantaged in terms of access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. In contrast, urban areas tend to have better infrastructure and economic opportunities, which has led to a significant migration of people from rural to urban areas. This migration has put pressure on urban services and infrastructure, and has also contributed to the growth of informal settlements and slums.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mestizo | 71% | Nationwide | Mixed European and indigenous ancestry |\n| Indigenous | 14% | Andean and Amazonian regions | Includes groups such as Quechua, Shuar, and Huaorani |\n| White | 6% | Urban areas | Primarily of Spanish and Italian descent |\n| Afro-Ecuadorian | 3% | Coastal regions | Descendants of African slaves |\n| Montubio | 2% | Coastal regions | Mixed indigenous and African ancestry |\n| Other | 4% | Nationwide | Includes Asian and Middle Eastern immigrants |\n[/TABLE]\nEcuador's ethnic diversity is reflected in the country's cultural heritage, with a mix of indigenous, European, and African influences.

The indigenous population, which accounts for around 14% of the population, includes groups such as the Quechua, Shuar, and Huaorani, who have maintained their traditional languages and customs.
