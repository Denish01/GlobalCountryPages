[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador's population is relatively small compared to other countries in South America, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 1.2%, which is slightly higher than the regional average. The country's urban population accounts for about 64% of the total population, with the majority residing in cities such as Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca. Ecuador has a relatively young population, with a median age of 27.8 years, and a life expectancy of 77.2 years. The country's population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with many people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities.

The population growth rate in Ecuador is influenced by factors such as fertility rates, mortality rates, and migration patterns. The country's fertility rate is approximately 2.4 children per woman, which is higher than the regional average. However, the fertility rate has been declining in recent years, particularly among urban women. Ecuador also has a significant diaspora community, with many Ecuadorians living abroad, particularly in the United States, Spain, and Italy.

Ecuador's population is also characterized by a significant rural-urban divide. The country's rural areas are often disadvantaged in terms of access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. In contrast, urban areas tend to have better infrastructure and economic opportunities, which has led to a significant migration of people from rural to urban areas. This migration has put pressure on urban services and infrastructure, and has also contributed to the growth of informal settlements and slums.
