[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nEcuador has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country is a popular tourist destination, and its government aims to encourage international travel and cultural exchange. As a result, citizens of over 80 countries can enter Ecuador visa-free, including many countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the Ecuadorian embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information.\n\nEcuador's visa policy is designed to be welcoming to tourists and business travelers, while also ensuring the country's security and immigration regulations are respected. The government offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. Visitors can stay in Ecuador for a maximum of 90 days within a 12-month period, although extensions are possible in some cases.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for a visa in advance and provide proof of onward travel |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply for a visa in advance and provide proof of onward travel |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can stay in Ecuador for up to 90 days within a 12-month period.
