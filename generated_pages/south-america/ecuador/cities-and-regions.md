[SECTION] How Ecuador Is Divided [/SECTION]
Ecuador is divided into 24 provinces, each with its own capital and a degree of autonomy. The provinces are further divided into cantons, which are then divided into parishes. This administrative structure allows for a relatively decentralized system of government, with provinces having a significant amount of control over local matters. The country's diverse geography and climate have also led to the development of distinct regional identities, with different provinces and regions having their own unique cultural, economic, and environmental characteristics.

The country's provinces are grouped into several regions, including the **Amazon Region**, the **Andean Region**, and the **Coastal Region**. Each region has its own unique characteristics, with the Amazon Region being home to a vast array of plant and animal species, the Andean Region being characterized by its rugged terrain and traditional indigenous communities, and the Coastal Region being known for its vibrant cities and beautiful beaches.
