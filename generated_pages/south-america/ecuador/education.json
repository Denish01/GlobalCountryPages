Primary education, also known as **basic education**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 14 and consists of 10 years of schooling. Secondary education, which is not compulsory, typically lasts for three years and provides students with a range of academic and vocational programs to choose from. Tertiary education, which includes universities and technical institutes, offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs in various fields, including **engineering**, **business**, and **medicine**. The quality of education in Ecuador varies between public and private institutions, with private schools and universities generally considered to be of higher quality.\n\nThe public education system in Ecuador is free and accessible to all citizens, but it faces several challenges, including a lack of resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. In contrast, private schools and universities in Ecuador are generally well-equipped and staffed with experienced teachers, but they can be expensive and out of reach for many students. Despite these challenges, the Ecuadorian government has implemented several initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods, and the provision of scholarships and financial assistance to disadvantaged students.\n\nThe education system in Ecuador is overseen by the **Ministry of Education**, which is responsible for setting national education policies, curricula, and standards. The ministry also provides funding and support to schools and universities, and works to promote education and literacy throughout the country. Overall, the education system in Ecuador provides students with a solid foundation in academic subjects and prepares them for further study and career advancement.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
