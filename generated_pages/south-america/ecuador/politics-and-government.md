[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Ecuador is based on the principles of **separation of powers**, where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches have distinct roles and responsibilities. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and government, and is responsible for appointing ministers and other high-ranking officials. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, a unicameral body with 137 seats, where members are elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The **judicial branch** is headed by the National Court of Justice, which is responsible for interpreting the constitution and ensuring that laws are applied fairly.

Ecuador's **unitary system** means that the central government has significant control over the country's provinces and municipalities, although there are some decentralization efforts underway to give more autonomy to local authorities. The country has a **presidential system**, where the president has significant powers, including the ability to appoint and remove ministers, as well as to dissolve the National Assembly in exceptional circumstances.

The Ecuadorian government also has a number of **independent institutions**, such as the Electoral Council, the Ombudsman's Office, and the National Anti-Corruption Secretariat, which are responsible for ensuring the integrity of the electoral process, protecting human rights, and preventing corruption.
