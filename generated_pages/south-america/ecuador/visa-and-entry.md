[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador has a relatively liberal visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country is a popular tourist destination, and its government aims to encourage international travel and cultural exchange. As a result, citizens of over 80 countries can enter Ecuador visa-free, including many countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the Ecuadorian embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information.

Ecuador's visa policy is designed to be welcoming to tourists and business travelers, while also ensuring the country's security and immigration regulations are respected. The government offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. Visitors can stay in Ecuador for a maximum of 90 days within a 12-month period, although extensions are possible in some cases.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
Ecuador has several main airports, including Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport and Guayaquil's José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport. When arriving at an airport, visitors will need to present their passport, proof of onward travel, and other required documents to immigration officials. Land borders are also an option, with major border crossings located at Tulcán (Colombia) and Huaquillas (Peru). At land borders, visitors will need to present their documents to immigration officials and may need to pay a small fee for processing. It is essential to ensure that all documents are in order and that visitors have the necessary visas and permits before attempting to enter the country.

Immigration procedures in Ecuador are generally straightforward, but it is essential to be patient and prepared. Visitors may be asked questions about their travel plans, accommodation, and activities in the country. It is also a good idea to have a basic understanding of Spanish, as not all immigration officials speak English. In some cases, visitors may be required to provide additional documentation or pay a fee for processing.
