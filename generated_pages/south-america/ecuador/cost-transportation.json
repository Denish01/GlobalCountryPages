The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent and reliable services in major cities like Quito and Guayaquil. Most people in Ecuador get around using buses and taxis, which are affordable and widely available. However, traffic congestion can be a problem in larger cities, especially during rush hour.\n\nIn addition to public transportation, many Ecuadorians also use **private vehicles**, which are becoming increasingly popular as the economy grows. However, this has also contributed to traffic congestion and air pollution in urban areas. The government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new bus rapid transit systems and the expansion of bike lanes and pedestrian walkways.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.25 | $25 | (good coverage in major cities) |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.50 | $30 | (available in Quito and Guayaquil) |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50 | N/A | (limited routes, but a cheap option) |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-2.00 | $50 | (limited availability, but a scenic option) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5-10 | |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.50 | $5-10 | (Uber, Cabify) |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-30 | (to city center) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | (economy car) |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-5 | |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-10 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | (typical route, e.g. Quito to Guayaquil) |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-50 | (limited availability, but a scenic option) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or **carpooling** with friends or colleagues.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Cabify to get around, as they are often cheaper than taxis.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a taxi, especially if you're not using a metered taxi.\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** and plan your route accordingly to avoid getting stuck in traffic.\n- Consider **renting a car** for long-distance trips or if you plan to explore rural areas.\n- Use **transportation apps** like Moovit or Transit to plan your route and get real-time updates on public transportation.",
