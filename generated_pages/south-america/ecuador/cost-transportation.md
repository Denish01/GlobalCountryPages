[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador has a well-developed transportation system, with a variety of options available for getting around, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent and reliable services in major cities like Quito and Guayaquil. Most people in Ecuador get around using buses and taxis, which are affordable and widely available. However, traffic congestion can be a problem in larger cities, especially during rush hour.

In addition to public transportation, many Ecuadorians also use **private vehicles**, which are becoming increasingly popular as the economy grows. However, this has also contributed to traffic congestion and air pollution in urban areas. The government is working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new bus rapid transit systems and the expansion of bike lanes and pedestrian walkways.
