[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador has a **territorial taxation** system, meaning that only income earned within the country is subject to taxation. However, individuals who are considered **tax residents** are also taxed on their worldwide income. To be considered a tax resident, an individual must have a permanent home in Ecuador, be present in the country for more than 183 days in a calendar year, or have a spouse or dependents who are tax residents. The tax system in Ecuador is overseen by the **Servicio de Rentas Internas (SRI)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing tax laws.

The tax year in Ecuador runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by April 30th of the following year. Ecuador has a network of **double taxation treaties** with 16 countries, which helps to prevent individuals and companies from being taxed twice on the same income. These treaties can provide significant tax savings for individuals and companies with international income.
