        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Ecuador has an Upper-Middle Income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $6,300. The country's economy is classified as a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. Ecuador's economic development level is considered to be relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with a strong focus on social welfare programs and poverty reduction. The country's economic trajectory has been shaped by its rich natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals, as well as its strategic location on the Pacific coast of South America.</p>
        <p>Ecuador's economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by a combination of factors including high oil prices, increased foreign investment, and government policies aimed at promoting economic development. However, the country's economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in international trade policies. The government has implemented a range of policies aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing dependence on oil exports, including investments in renewable energy, tourism, and manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, Ecuador's economy remains one of the most stable and prosperous in the region, with a strong focus on social welfare and poverty reduction. The country's economic outlook is positive, with forecasts indicating continued growth and development in the coming years. However, the government will need to continue to implement policies aimed at promoting economic diversification and reducing dependence on oil exports in order to ensure long-term sustainability.</p>

The government will also need to address challenges such as <strong>corruption</strong> and <strong>inequality</strong>, which can undermine economic development and social stability. With the right policies in place, Ecuador has the potential to become a major economic player in the region, with a strong and diverse economy that benefits all citizens.</p>
