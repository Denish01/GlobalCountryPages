[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador's cuisine is a unique blend of indigenous, Spanish, and African influences, shaped by the country's geography and cultural heritage. The Andean highlands, the Amazon rainforest, and the coastal regions each have their own distinct culinary traditions, with ingredients such as potatoes, corn, and beans playing a central role. The Spanish conquest introduced new ingredients like rice, wheat, and pork, which were incorporated into traditional dishes. African influences can be seen in the use of plantains, yuca, and peanuts in many coastal dishes.

Ecuadorian cuisine is also characterized by its use of fresh ingredients, with many dishes featuring locally sourced fruits, vegetables, and proteins. The country's vibrant markets, such as the **Mercado Central** in Quito, offer a wide range of fresh produce, meats, and dairy products. Regional variations are also significant, with the highlands specializing in hearty soups and stews, the coast focusing on fresh seafood, and the Amazon region featuring exotic ingredients like **aguaje** and **cupuacu**.

Ecuador's cultural heritage is also reflected in its cuisine, with many traditional dishes served during special occasions and celebrations. For example, **Rosquillas**, a type of fried doughnut, is typically served during the **Fiestas de Quito**, while **Hornado**, a roasted pork dish, is a staple of Christmas celebrations.
