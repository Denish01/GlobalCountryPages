[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public system being the primary source of care for the majority of the population. The public system is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost care to all citizens, while the private system is more expensive but offers higher quality care and shorter wait times. The quality of care in Ecuador varies between urban and rural areas, with cities like Quito and Guayaquil having more advanced medical facilities and specialized care, while rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services. Despite these challenges, Ecuador has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to care and reducing health disparities.

The public healthcare system in Ecuador is managed by the Ministry of Public Health, which oversees a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. The public system provides a range of services, including primary care, specialty care, and emergency services. However, the public system is often overcrowded and underfunded, which can result in long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private healthcare system in Ecuador is more advanced and offers a higher level of care, with many private hospitals and clinics having modern facilities and equipment.

Overall, Ecuador's healthcare system is working to improve access to care and reduce health disparities, but there are still challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas. Foreigners living in Ecuador can access both public and private healthcare services, but may need to purchase private health insurance to access the higher quality care available in the private system.
