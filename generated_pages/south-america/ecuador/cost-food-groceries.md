[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to buying groceries, Ecuador offers a range of options, from modern supermarkets to traditional local markets. While supermarkets like **Tía** and **Mi Comisariato** offer a wide range of products, including imported goods, local markets like **Mercado Central** in Quito and **Mercado Sur** in Guayaquil offer a more traditional shopping experience, with fresh produce, meats, and dairy products at competitive prices. In general, local markets tend to be cheaper than supermarkets, especially for fresh produce and meats. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and may be more convenient for those who prefer to shop in a more modern environment.

When shopping at local markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for fresh produce and meats. Vendors often expect customers to negotiate, and it's not uncommon to get a discount of 10-20% off the initial price. In contrast, supermarkets tend to have fixed prices, and haggling is not common. When deciding where to shop, consider what you need to buy and whether you prefer the convenience of a supermarket or the traditional experience of a local market.
