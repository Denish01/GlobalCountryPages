[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest and most accessible. The quality of public education can vary depending on the region and resources available, but it is generally considered to be good. The language of instruction is Spanish, and there are also some bilingual schools that offer instruction in English. Compulsory education in Ecuador lasts for 10 years, from the age of 5 to 15, and is divided into primary and secondary education. International schools are also available in major cities like Quito and Guayaquil, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and the American curriculum.

The education system in Ecuador is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards and ensuring that all schools meet minimum quality requirements. Private schools, on the other hand, have more flexibility in terms of curriculum and teaching methods, and are often preferred by expat families and those who can afford them. International schools, in particular, offer a high-quality education that is recognized globally, but can be very expensive, with annual fees ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 or more.
