The Andean highlands, the Amazon rainforest, and the coastal regions each have their own distinct culinary traditions, with ingredients such as potatoes, corn, and beans playing a central role. The Spanish conquest introduced new ingredients like rice, wheat, and pork, which were incorporated into traditional dishes. African influences can be seen in the use of plantains, yuca, and peanuts in many coastal dishes.\n\nEcuadorian cuisine is also characterized by its use of fresh ingredients, with many dishes featuring locally sourced fruits, vegetables, and proteins. The country's vibrant markets, such as the **Mercado Central** in Quito, offer a wide range of fresh produce, meats, and dairy products. Regional variations are also significant, with the highlands specializing in hearty soups and stews, the coast focusing on fresh seafood, and the Amazon region featuring exotic ingredients like **aguaje** and **cupuacu**.\n\nEcuador's cultural heritage is also reflected in its cuisine, with many traditional dishes served during special occasions and celebrations. For example, **Rosquillas**, a type of fried doughnut, is typically served during the **Fiestas de Quito**, while **Hornado**, a roasted pork dish, is a staple of Christmas celebrations.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Locro de Papas** | Soup | Hearty potato soup with cheese, milk, and avocado | Quito, highland regions |\n| **Seco de Carne** | Stew | Braised beef stew with potatoes, peas, and carrots | Quito, highland regions |\n| **Ensalada de Tomate y Pepino** | Salad | Fresh tomato and cucumber salad with onions and cilantro | Coastal regions, markets |\n| **Ceviche de Camarones** | Seafood | Fresh shrimp marinated in lime juice, mixed with onions and tomatoes | Coastal regions, seafood restaurants |\n| **Llapingachos** | Side dish | Mashed potato patties with cheese and avocado | Quito, highland regions |\n| **Empanadas** | Snack | Fried or baked pastry pockets filled with meat, cheese, or vegetables | Markets, street food stalls |\n| **Arroz con Mariscos** | Seafood | Saffron-infused rice with mixed seafood, including shrimp, mussels, and clams | Coastal regions, seafood restaurants |\n| **Canelazo** | Dessert | Warm cinnamon drink made with fruit juice and spices, served with **rosquillas** | Quito, highland regions |\n| **Torta de Verde** | Dessert | Green plantain cake with cream cheese frosting | Coastal regions, bakeries |\n| **Humitas** | Snack | Steamed corn pudding with cheese, onions, and cilantro | Markets, street food stalls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Empanadas**: fried or baked pastry pockets filled with meat, cheese, or vegetables, $1-2 USD\n- **Llapingachos**: mashed potato patties with cheese and avocado, $2-3 USD\n- **Humitas**: steamed corn pudding with cheese, onions, and cilantro, $1-2 USD\n- **Churros**: fried dough pastries coated in sugar, $1-2 USD\n- **Tostado**: toasted corn kernels with cheese, chili, and lime juice, $1-2 USD\n- **Canguil**: fried green plantain chips with cheese and avocado, $2-3 USD\n- **Patacones**: fried green plantain slices with cheese and avocado, $2-3 USD\n- **Ch'arki**: dried llama meat, often served as a snack, $3-5 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Canelazo**: warm cinnamon drink made with fruit juice and spices\n- **Jugo de Tomate**: fresh tomato juice\n- **Jugo de Naranja**: fresh orange juice\n- **Cerveza**: local beer, such as **Pilsener** or **Club**\n- **Rum**: local rum, often served with **jugo de naranja** or **jugo de tomate**\n- **Fresh coconut water**: available at many markets and street food stalls\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Eating with your hands is generally not accepted, except for snacks like **empanadas** or **humitas**\n- Tipping is expected, around 5-10% of the total bill\n- Reservations are recommended for high-end restaurants, but not necessary for casual eateries\n- Dress codes vary, but casual attire is generally acceptable\n- Trying local dishes and ingredients is highly encouraged, as it supports the local economy and cultural heritage\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Mercado Central**: vibrant market in Quito offering a wide range of fresh produce, meats, and dairy products\n- **Food courts**: many shopping malls and markets have food courts with a variety of local and international options\n- **Restaurants**: from high-end eateries to casual cafes, Ecuador has a wide range of dining options\n- **Street food stalls**: many streets and markets have street food stalls offering snacks and light meals\n- **Local eateries**: family-run restaurants serving traditional dishes, often at affordable prices\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Mercado Central**: Quito, a vibrant market offering a wide range of fresh produce, meats, and dairy products\n- **Mercado de Santa Clara**: Quito, a market specializing in traditional dishes and local ingredients\n- **Feria de San Pedro**: Cuenca, a fair featuring local food, drinks, and handicrafts\n- **Food tour**: Quito, a guided tour exploring the city's culinary scene and traditional dishes\n- **Cooking class**: Quito, a hands-on class teaching traditional Ecuadorian cuisine and cooking techniques",
