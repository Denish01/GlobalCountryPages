# Ecuador Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Ecuador's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 97% of population
Internet Penetration: 54%
Road Network: 43,790 km, with 19% paved
Rail Network: 965 km
Major Airports: 10
Major Ports: 5
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador's infrastructure development level is moderate, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has made significant investments in recent years to improve its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and airports. However, much of the country's infrastructure is still in need of upgrading, particularly in rural areas where access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation can be limited. The government has launched several initiatives to address these issues, including a major program to expand access to electricity and improve the reliability of the power grid.

Despite these efforts, Ecuador's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including a lack of investment in maintenance and repair. This has resulted in a number of high-profile failures, including the collapse of a major bridge in 2019. The government has also faced criticism for its handling of infrastructure projects, with some critics arguing that the focus on large-scale projects has come at the expense of smaller, more localized initiatives.

Ecuador's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods. The country is located in a seismically active region and is prone to frequent earthquakes, which can cause significant damage to infrastructure. In 2016, a major earthquake struck the country, causing widespread damage and disruption to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.
