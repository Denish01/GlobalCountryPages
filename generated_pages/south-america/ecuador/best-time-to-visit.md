[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Ecuador is a country with diverse climate zones, ranging from the tropical rainforests of the Amazon basin to the dry deserts of the coastal region, and the cold **paramo** ecosystems of the Andean highlands. The country's unique geography creates a variety of microclimates, resulting in different dry and wet seasons across regions. The dry season, which typically runs from June to November, is characterized by clear skies, mild temperatures, and low humidity, making it the best time to visit Ecuador. In contrast, the wet season, which runs from December to May, is marked by heavy rainfall, high humidity, and potential flooding in some areas.

The seasons in Ecuador have a significant impact on travel, as some regions become inaccessible during the wet season due to flooded roads and landslides. The dry season, on the other hand, offers ideal conditions for hiking, trekking, and exploring the country's national parks and wildlife reserves. The **Galapagos Islands**, a popular tourist destination, have a unique climate, with a dry season from June to November and a wet season from December to May. However, the islands can be visited year-round, with the warmest months being from January to May.

The Andean highlands, which include the capital city of Quito, have a mild climate year-round, with average temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F). The coastal region, on the other hand, has a tropical climate, with high temperatures and humidity levels throughout the year. The Amazon rainforest has a warm and humid climate, with frequent rainfall and high temperatures. Understanding the different climate zones and seasons is essential for planning a trip to Ecuador and making the most of your time in this diverse and fascinating country.
