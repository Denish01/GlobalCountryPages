[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Ecuador has several international airports, with the main ones being Mariscal Sucre International Airport (UIO) in Quito and José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport (GYE) in Guayaquil. These airports receive direct flights from major hubs in the United States, Europe, and other Latin American countries. You can also enter Ecuador overland from Colombia or Peru, with several border crossings available, including the Rumichaca border crossing from Colombia and the Huaquillas border crossing from Peru. 

If you plan to enter Ecuador by land, make sure to research the current border crossing requirements and any necessary documentation, such as a valid passport and visa if required. Additionally, consider the time of year and potential weather conditions that may affect road travel. For example, the rainy season in Ecuador can make some roads impassable, so it's essential to plan ahead and check the current conditions before embarking on your journey.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Ecuador has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities, including Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca. The main domestic airlines are TAME, Avianca, and LATAM, which offer frequent flights to various destinations within the country. When booking domestic flights, it's recommended to compare prices and schedules in advance to find the best option for your needs. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and airline. You can book flights online through the airlines' websites or through a local travel agency.

Ecuador's rail network is limited, with only a few tourist trains operating in specific regions, such as the Quito to Latacunga route. The most notable train is the Tren Crucero, which runs from Quito to Guayaquil and offers a scenic route through the Andes.

There are no high-speed train options available in Ecuador, and the booking process for tourist trains can be done through a local travel agency or online.
