[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Falkland Islands is relatively small and limited, with most properties being rented out to locals and expatriates working in the **fishing** and **tourism** industries. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under the Falkland Islands' **Residential Tenancies Ordinance**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors like Argentina, the cost of housing in Falkland Islands is relatively high due to the islands' remote location and limited supply of properties.

The Falkland Islands' housing market is also influenced by the local economy, which is driven by the **fishing industry** and **tourism**. The demand for housing is relatively high, especially in the capital city of Stanley, where most of the population resides. As a result, rental prices can be steep, especially for properties in the city center. However, the cost of living in Falkland Islands is generally lower compared to other South American countries, making it an attractive destination for expatriates and retirees.
