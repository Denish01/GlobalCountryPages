The urban-rural divide is significant, with the capital city Stanley having relatively better internet connectivity compared to the rest of the islands. The reliability of the internet is also a concern, with frequent disruptions due to weather conditions and outdated infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the Falkland Islands Government is working to improve the internet infrastructure, with plans to upgrade the existing network and increase bandwidth.\n\nThe internet in Falkland Islands is mostly used for basic purposes such as email, social media, and online banking, with limited opportunities for streaming or online gaming due to the slow speeds. The lack of high-speed internet has also hindered the growth of the local economy, particularly in the tourism sector, where visitors often expect faster and more reliable internet connectivity. However, the scenic beauty and unique wildlife of the Falkland Islands continue to attract tourists, who are willing to compromise on internet connectivity for the sake of experiencing the islands' natural wonders.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Falkland Islands, tourists can visit the offices of the main carriers, such as Sure or Cable & Wireless, in Stanley.
