# The Truth About Falkland Islands - History & Real Facts

The Falkland Islands, a British overseas territory in the South Atlantic, are often misunderstood due to a lack of information and misconceptions about their history, culture, and geography. 

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
The Falkland Islands have a complex and disputed history, with various claims of discovery and settlement. The first recorded landing on the islands was by British explorer John Davis in 1592, but it was not until 1764 that the French established the first permanent settlement. The British established their own settlement in 1765, and in 1767, the Spanish took control of the islands from the French. The British returned in 1833 and have since maintained control over the territory. The Falkland Islands were officially declared a British colony in 1841, and in 1982, the Falkland Islands War broke out between the United Kingdom and Argentina, resulting in the UK maintaining control over the islands.

The Falkland Islands have a total area of 12,173 km² and a population of 3,662 people, according to the latest verified data. The capital and largest settlement is Stanley, which is home to about 75% of the population. The islands have a long history of sheep farming and fishing, which have been the mainstays of the economy. The Falkland Islands are classified as a British overseas territory, with the UK responsible for defense and foreign affairs.
