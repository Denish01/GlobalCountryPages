The market is mostly driven by local demand, with some interest from foreigners, particularly those with ties to the UK or involved in the islands' fishing and tourism industries. The current market conditions are relatively stable, with prices showing a gradual increase over the past few years. The urban area of Stanley, the capital, is the most sought-after location, while rural areas, such as Camp, are also popular for those seeking a more secluded lifestyle.\n\nThe price trajectory in the Falkland Islands has been steadily increasing, driven by the growing demand for housing, particularly in Stanley. However, the market remains relatively small, and prices are still relatively low compared to other South American countries. The urban vs rural divide is also evident in the property market, with Stanley offering more amenities and services, while rural areas provide a more peaceful and natural environment.\n\nThe Falkland Islands government has implemented measures to control the property market and ensure that it benefits the local community. For example, the government has introduced a **property tax** to discourage non-resident ownership and encourage locals to invest in the market. Additionally, the government has established a **housing committee** to oversee the development of new housing projects and ensure that they meet the needs of the local community.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stanley | 1,800 | 800 | Apartment |\n| Mount Pleasant | 1,200 | 600 | House |\n| Camp | 900 | 400 | House |\n| Goose Green | 800 | 350 | House |\n| Port Howard | 700 | 300 | House |\n| Fox Bay | 600 | 250 | House |\n| Pebble Island | 500 | 200 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy properties in the Falkland Islands, but they need to obtain a **license** from the Falkland Islands government.\n- The license is typically granted to foreigners who have a **genuine connection** to the islands, such as being married to a local or having a business in the islands.\n- Foreigners can also lease properties for a maximum period of **25 years**, which can be renewed.\n- Foreign companies can also buy properties, but they need to be registered in the Falkland Islands and have a **local director**.\n- Foreigners who buy properties in the Falkland Islands need to obtain a **permit** from the government, which can take several months to process.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
