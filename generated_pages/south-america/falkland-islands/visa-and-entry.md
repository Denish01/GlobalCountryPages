[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The Falkland Islands have a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of certain countries, including the United Kingdom, are eligible for visa-free access, while others may need to obtain a visa on arrival or in advance. The Falkland Islands government aims to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development.

The visa policy is designed to ensure that visitors are genuine tourists, business travelers, or workers, and that they do not pose a risk to the islands' security or environment. The Falkland Islands are a British overseas territory, and as such, their visa policy is closely tied to that of the United Kingdom. However, there are some unique requirements and regulations that apply specifically to the Falkland Islands.
