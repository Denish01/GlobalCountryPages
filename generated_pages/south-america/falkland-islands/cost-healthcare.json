  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Falkland Islands can be relatively high, especially for foreigners, with a mix of public and private services available, and insurance is highly recommended to cover medical expenses.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $4,335 (World Bank figure, 2019)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 24.4% (World Bank figure, 2019)\nHealthcare System: Public / Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112 or 999\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: FKP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Falkland Islands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private services available. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality and is free for residents, but it may have limited resources and specialized services. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers more specialized services and is generally of higher quality, but it can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of healthcare, while foreigners may need to rely on private services or have insurance to cover their medical expenses. The healthcare system is managed by the Falkland Islands Government, which also provides some financial support for residents who need to travel abroad for medical treatment.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in the Falkland Islands is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the limited size of the islands and the remote location can make it difficult to access specialized services, and medical evacuations to the UK or other countries may be necessary for complex cases. For foreigners, it is essential to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as well as evacuation costs, to ensure access to quality healthcare. The Falkland Islands Government also recommends that visitors have comprehensive travel insurance that includes medical coverage.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Limited availability of private services |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | May require medical evacuation to UK or other countries |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Limited availability of private dental services |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Limited availability of private optometry services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | May require medical evacuation to UK or other countries for specialized tests |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Limited availability of emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,000 | Limited availability of private hospital services |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | May require medical evacuation to UK or other countries |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | Limited availability of private obstetric services |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,500 | May require medical evacuation to UK or other countries |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Limited availability of private radiology services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, limited private services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, medical evacuation, specialized treatments |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Comprehensive private services, medical evacuation, specialized treatments, worldwide coverage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication is available at the public hospital and some private pharmacies, with costs ranging from $5 to $50 per prescription.\n- Over-the-counter medication is available at private pharmacies, with costs ranging from $5 to $20 per item.\n- Some prescription medications may need to be imported from the UK or other countries, which can increase costs and waiting times.\n- Pharmacy services are limited, and some medications may not be available on the islands.\n- The Falkland Islands Government provides some financial support for residents who need to purchase prescription medication.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, dial 112 or 999 to reach the emergency services.
