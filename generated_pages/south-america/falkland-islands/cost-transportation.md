[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The Falkland Islands have a limited public transportation system, with most residents relying on personal vehicles or taxis to get around. The main transportation modes are taxis, buses, and private cars, with the quality of public transit being relatively basic. The capital city, Stanley, has a few bus routes, but services are infrequent and often unreliable. As a result, most people get around by driving their own vehicles or using taxis.

The islands' rugged terrain and limited road network make it difficult to maintain a comprehensive public transportation system. However, the government is working to improve the infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the upgrading of existing ones. Despite these efforts, the cost of transportation in the Falkland Islands remains relatively high due to the remote location and limited competition.
