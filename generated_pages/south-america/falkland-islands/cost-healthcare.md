[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The Falkland Islands has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private services available. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality and is free for residents, but it may have limited resources and specialized services. The private healthcare system, on the other hand, offers more specialized services and is generally of higher quality, but it can be expensive. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of healthcare, while foreigners may need to rely on private services or have insurance to cover their medical expenses. The healthcare system is managed by the Falkland Islands Government, which also provides some financial support for residents who need to travel abroad for medical treatment.

The quality of healthcare in the Falkland Islands is generally good, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment. However, the limited size of the islands and the remote location can make it difficult to access specialized services, and medical evacuations to the UK or other countries may be necessary for complex cases. For foreigners, it is essential to have insurance that covers medical expenses, as well as evacuation costs, to ensure access to quality healthcare. The Falkland Islands Government also recommends that visitors have comprehensive travel insurance that includes medical coverage.
