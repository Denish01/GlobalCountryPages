[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Falkland Islands property market is characterized by a limited supply of properties, primarily due to the islands' remote location and small population. The market is mostly driven by local demand, with some interest from foreigners, particularly those with ties to the UK or involved in the islands' fishing and tourism industries. The current market conditions are relatively stable, with prices showing a gradual increase over the past few years. The urban area of Stanley, the capital, is the most sought-after location, while rural areas, such as Camp, are also popular for those seeking a more secluded lifestyle.

The price trajectory in the Falkland Islands has been steadily increasing, driven by the growing demand for housing, particularly in Stanley. However, the market remains relatively small, and prices are still relatively low compared to other South American countries. The urban vs rural divide is also evident in the property market, with Stanley offering more amenities and services, while rural areas provide a more peaceful and natural environment.

The Falkland Islands government has implemented measures to control the property market and ensure that it benefits the local community. For example, the government has introduced a **property tax** to discourage non-resident ownership and encourage locals to invest in the market. Additionally, the government has established a **housing committee** to oversee the development of new housing projects and ensure that they meet the needs of the local community.
