  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Falkland Islands can range from $200 to $500 per month for a medium-sized apartment, depending on usage and services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($350 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($100 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($30 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.25 per kWh)\nCurrency: FKP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Falkland Islands have a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with electricity, water, and garbage collection services available to most residents. However, the costs of these services can be subject to fluctuation due to the remote location of the islands and the need to import fuel and other essential supplies. The cost of electricity, in particular, can vary depending on the time of year, with higher rates applying during the winter months when demand is greater. The Falkland Islands Government subsidizes some utility costs, which helps to keep prices relatively stable for residents.\n\nThe quality of utility services in the Falkland Islands is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, the islands' remote location can make it difficult to maintain services during periods of bad weather or other disruptions. The government and utility providers work to minimize the impact of these disruptions, but residents may experience occasional outages or interruptions to service. Overall, the cost of utilities in the Falkland Islands is relatively high compared to other countries, but the quality of services is generally good and the government subsidies help to make them more affordable for residents.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $150 | rates vary by season |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | flat rate |\n| Gas / Heating | $50 | $70 | $90 | oil-fired heating common |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | included in council tax |\n| **Total** | **$160** | **$235** | **$300** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $50-70 | 10 Mbps | Sure, KPN |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 60 Mbps | Sure, KPN |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $20-30 | 5 GB | Sure, KPN |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $30-50 | 10 GB | Sure, KPN |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | Sure, KPN |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available via satellite |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available via internet |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Falkland Islands radio and TV services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, contact the relevant provider (e.g. electricity, water, internet) and provide proof of address and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help residents budget and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Sure and KPN are the main internet and phone providers in the Falkland Islands, and offer a range of plans and bundles.\n- Residents can save on utility bills by using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and insulating their homes to reduce heating costs.\n- The Falkland Islands Government offers subsidies and assistance programs to help low-income residents with utility costs, so it's worth contacting the government to see if you're eligible for any support.",
