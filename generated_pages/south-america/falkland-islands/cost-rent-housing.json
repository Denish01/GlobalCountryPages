Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under the Falkland Islands' **Residential Tenancies Ordinance**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to regional neighbors like Argentina, the cost of housing in Falkland Islands is relatively high due to the islands' remote location and limited supply of properties.\n\nThe Falkland Islands' housing market is also influenced by the local economy, which is driven by the **fishing industry** and **tourism**. The demand for housing is relatively high, especially in the capital city of Stanley, where most of the population resides. As a result, rental prices can be steep, especially for properties in the city center. However, the cost of living in Falkland Islands is generally lower compared to other South American countries, making it an attractive destination for expatriates and retirees.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$900 | $400-$600 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $500-$900 | fully furnished, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,800 | $700-$1,400 | family-sized, with living room and dining area |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,500 | $1,000-$2,000 | spacious, with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$4,000 | prime locations, with sea views and modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$3,000 | residential areas, with easy access to town center |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,000 | rural areas, with scenic views and peaceful surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Stanley**: the capital city, with a range of accommodation options, from apartments to houses, and a vibrant community of expats and locals, with typical rent range of $800-$1,200 USD per month.\n- **Port Stanley**: a charming neighborhood with a mix of old and new properties, close to the town center and amenities, with typical rent range of $600-$1,000 USD per month.\n- **Mount Pleasant**: a residential area with modern homes and stunning views of the surrounding countryside, with typical rent range of $500-$900 USD per month.\n- **Mare Harbour**: a coastal neighborhood with a range of properties, from apartments to houses, and easy access to the **fishing industry**, with typical rent range of $400-$800 USD per month.\n- **Darwin**: a rural area with scenic views and peaceful surroundings, ideal for those looking for a quiet and secluded lifestyle, with typical rent range of $300-$600 USD per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Falkland Islands [/SECTION]\n- Research thoroughly and plan ahead, as the rental market in Falkland Islands can be competitive, especially in the city center.\n- Consider working with a local real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable property, as they can provide valuable insights and advice.\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and first month's rent upfront, as this is a common practice in the Falkland Islands.\n- Check the property carefully before signing a lease, as some properties may require maintenance or repairs.\n- Be aware of the **Residential Tenancies Ordinance**, which outlines the rights and responsibilities of both landlords and tenants, and seek advice from a local expert if necessary.\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and heating are usually included in the rent, but it's essential to clarify this with the landlord before signing a lease.",
