The lack of local agriculture and livestock production means that most food items are shipped in, resulting in higher prices. Eating out is a popular option in the capital, Stanley, with many restaurants serving traditional British and **seafood** dishes. However, home cooking is also common, with many residents opting to prepare meals using imported ingredients. The territory's small population and limited competition contribute to the higher prices, making it essential for visitors and residents to budget accordingly.\n\nThe food culture in Falkland Islands is shaped by its British heritage, with many traditional dishes featuring **meat**, **fish**, and **potatoes**. However, the territory's remote location and limited access to fresh produce mean that prices for fruits and vegetables are particularly high. Residents often rely on canned or frozen alternatives, which can be more affordable. The government's efforts to support local farming and fishing initiatives aim to reduce the territory's reliance on imports and lower food prices in the long term.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 1.80 FKP | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $3.50 | 2.50 FKP | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $4.00 | 2.80 FKP | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2.00 | 1.40 FKP | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $10.00 | 7.00 FKP | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $15.00 | 10.50 FKP | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $6.00 | 4.20 FKP | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $5.00 | 3.50 FKP | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 1.80 FKP | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $2.00 | 1.40 FKP | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $12.00 | 8.40 FKP | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2.00 | 1.40 FKP | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-$15 | **Fish and chips**, **sandwiches** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-$30 | **burgers**, **salads** |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$60 | **seafood**, **steak** |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $80-$100 | **upscale seafood**, **wine** |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $7-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $4-$6 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nPrices for groceries and essentials can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Falkland Islands.
