[SECTION] How Falkland Islands Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Falkland Islands is a British overseas territory, and as such, it has a relatively simple administrative structure. The islands are divided into two main areas: Camp, which refers to the rural areas outside of Stanley, and Stanley, which is the capital and largest settlement. This division is largely based on the historical development of the islands, with Stanley being the center of government, commerce, and population, while Camp encompasses the more rural and remote areas. The Falkland Islands government is responsible for internal affairs, while the United Kingdom is responsible for defense and foreign affairs.

The administrative divisions of the Falkland Islands are not as complex as those found in larger countries, and the islands do not have a large number of cities or towns. Instead, the population is concentrated in Stanley, with smaller settlements and farms scattered throughout Camp. This simple structure reflects the small size and remote location of the Falkland Islands, as well as their historical development as a British overseas territory.
