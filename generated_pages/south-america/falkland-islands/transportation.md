[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Falkland Islands can be reached by air or sea, with the main entry point being Mount Pleasant Airport, which is located about 35 miles west of Stanley, the capital city. The airport receives flights from Chile and the United Kingdom, with LATAM and British Airways being the primary carriers. There are no direct flights from other countries, so travelers typically need to connect through Santiago or London. The airport also serves as a hub for domestic flights to other parts of the islands.

For those who prefer to travel by sea, there are several cruise lines that visit the Falkland Islands, often as part of a larger itinerary that includes other destinations in South America and Antarctica. Additionally, the Falkland Islands Government operates a weekly ferry service between East Falkland and West Falkland, which is a popular option for both locals and tourists. However, overland entry points do not exist, as the Falkland Islands are an archipelago located off the coast of South America.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
The domestic air network in the Falkland Islands is limited, with most flights operating out of Stanley Airport, which is located near the capital city. FIGAS, the Falkland Islands Government Air Service, is the primary carrier, offering flights to various destinations throughout the islands, including Pebble Island, Saunders Island, and Sea Lion Island. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as the number of flights and seats is limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300, depending on the destination and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
There is no rail network in the Falkland Islands, so trains are not an option for getting around. The lack of a rail system is due to the islands' remote location and limited population, which has made it impractical to develop a rail network.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are no commercial bus or coach services in the Falkland Islands, as the territory's small population and limited road network make it unnecessary. However, some tour operators offer bus tours and transportation services, which can be a convenient option for tourists who want to see the sights without worrying about driving or navigating the islands' rugged terrain.
