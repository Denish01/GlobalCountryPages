[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Argentina has a well-developed transportation network, with a mix of public and private options available. The main modes of transportation include buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services, with most people relying on these options to get around. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities like Buenos Aires and Cordoba having more comprehensive systems, while smaller towns and rural areas may have more limited options.

In general, public transportation in Argentina is relatively affordable, with a single bus fare costing around $0.50-$1.00 USD. However, the frequency and coverage of public transportation can be inconsistent, especially outside of major cities. As a result, many people rely on taxis and ride-hailing services, which can be more expensive but offer greater convenience and flexibility. Additionally, the country's high inflation rate, currently at 219.9%, can make transportation costs unpredictable and subject to change.
