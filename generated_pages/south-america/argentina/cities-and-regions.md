[SECTION] How Argentina Is Divided [/SECTION]
Argentina is divided into 23 provinces and 1 autonomous city, which is the capital, Buenos Aires. The provinces are further divided into departments, which are then divided into municipalities. This administrative structure allows for a degree of autonomy for each province, while the federal government maintains control over national issues. The provinces are responsible for providing various public services, such as education, healthcare, and transportation, while the federal government is responsible for national defense, foreign policy, and economic policy.

The provinces in Argentina are diverse, ranging from the sparsely populated provinces of Patagonia to the densely populated provinces of the Pampas region. Each province has its own unique character, history, and culture, which are reflected in its architecture, cuisine, and traditions. The provinces are also home to a wide range of natural attractions, including mountains, rivers, and coastlines, which make Argentina a popular destination for tourists and outdoor enthusiasts.
