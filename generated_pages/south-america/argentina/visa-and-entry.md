# Argentina Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Argentina before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Argentina has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country provides visa-free access to citizens of around 90 countries, including most European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan. This liberal approach to visa policy makes Argentina an attractive destination for tourists and business travelers alike. The country's visa policy is designed to promote tourism, trade, and cultural exchange, while also ensuring the security and integrity of its borders.

Argentina's visa policy is divided into several categories, including tourist, business, student, and work visas. The requirements and regulations for each category vary, but the overall goal is to facilitate the entry and stay of foreign nationals in Argentina while maintaining national security and public order. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free agreement with Argentina may need to apply for a visa at an Argentine embassy or consulate before traveling to the country.

Land borders are also open, with major crossings at the borders with Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay. Upon arrival, travelers must present their passport and required documents to the immigration officer, who will review and stamp the passport. The officer may also ask questions about the purpose of the visit, the length of stay, and the accommodation arrangements.
