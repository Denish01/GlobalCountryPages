  "content": "Healthcare in Argentina is a mixed system that combines public and private providers, offering a wide range of medical services to its citizens and visitors, with varying levels of quality and accessibility depending on the region and type of care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 3/5\nEmergency Number: 107\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nArgentina's healthcare system is divided into three main sectors: the public sector, the private sector, and the social security sector, which provides coverage to workers and their families. The public sector provides free or low-cost healthcare to all citizens, while the private sector offers higher-quality care to those who can afford it. The quality of care in Argentina is generally good, with many well-trained doctors and modern medical facilities, especially in urban areas like Buenos Aires. However, the public sector often faces challenges such as long waiting times, overcrowding, and limited resources, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe healthcare system in Argentina is also characterized by a strong presence of **mutualidades**, which are non-profit organizations that provide health insurance and medical services to their members. These mutualidades often have their own hospitals and clinics, and offer a range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. In addition, many Argentines also have private health insurance, which provides access to higher-quality care and a wider range of medical services.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the public sector, Argentina has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with investments in new medical facilities, equipment, and training programs for healthcare professionals. However, more work is needed to address the disparities in access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas, and to improve the overall quality of care.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics
