The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is elected by popular vote for a four-year term. The President is both the head of state and the head of government, and is responsible for appointing the cabinet and overseeing the administration of the government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Congress, which is a bicameral body made up of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The Senate has 72 seats, with three senators elected from each of the country's 24 provinces, while the Chamber of Deputies has 257 seats, with deputies elected from each province based on population. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, which are responsible for interpreting the constitution and federal laws.\n\nThe Argentine government is also divided into **federal** and **provincial** levels. The federal government is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, national defense, and economic policy, while the provincial governments have jurisdiction over matters such as education, healthcare, and law enforcement. This division of power is established by the **Constitution of Argentina**, which was adopted in 1853 and has been amended several times since then.\n\nThe Argentine political system is based on the principles of **representative democracy**, where citizens elect their representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The system is designed to provide a balance of power between the different branches of government, and to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. This is achieved through a system of **checks and balances**, where each branch has some ability to limit the actions of the other branches.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Alberto Fernández | Head of state and government, appoints cabinet |\n| Legislative | National Congress | President of the Senate Claudia Ledesma Abdala | Makes laws, approves presidential appointments |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice Carlos Rosenkrantz | Interprets constitution and federal laws, tries federal cases |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Justicialist Party | Center-left | Alberto Fernández | 64 | Dominant party in the Peronist movement |\n| Radical Civic Union | Center-right | Alfredo Cornejo | 45 | Historically one of the two major parties in Argentina |\n| Republican Proposal | Right-wing | Patricia Bullrich | 21 | Liberal conservative party with a strong presence in Buenos Aires |\n| Civic Coalition | Center-left | Elisa Carrió | 15 | Alliance of several smaller parties, known for its anti-corruption stance |\n| Socialist Party | Left-wing | Rubén Giustiniani | 6 | Historically significant party, now a minor player in Argentine politics |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The **electoral system** in Argentina is based on universal suffrage, with all citizens over the age of 18 eligible to vote.\n- **Elections** are held every four years for the presidency and the National Congress, with the most recent election taking place in 2019.\n- The **last election** saw the victory of Alberto Fernández, who won the presidency with 48.1% of the vote.\n- The **next election** is scheduled to take place in 2023, with the presidency and all seats in the National Congress up for grabs.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current **political climate** in Argentina is marked by high levels of polarization and social unrest, with ongoing protests and strikes over issues such as economic policy and corruption.\n- **Key issues** facing the government include high inflation, a large fiscal deficit, and a declining economy.\n- **Regional dynamics** play a significant role in Argentine politics, with the country's relationships with its neighbors and other regional powers such as Brazil and the United States being important factors.\n- Argentina's **freedom indices** are generally positive, with the country ranking 64th out of 180 countries in the 2022 Press Freedom Index and 43rd out of 180 countries in the 2022 Human Freedom Index.\n- The country also faces **challenges** related to crime and security, with high levels of violent crime and corruption being major concerns.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Argentina is a member of several **international organizations**, including the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the Mercosur trading bloc.\n- The country has a **key alliance** with Brazil, with which it has a long-standing relationship based on shared cultural and economic ties.\n- Argentina also has a **diplomatic stance** that is generally aligned with other countries in the region, with a focus on promoting regional integration and cooperation.\n- The country is a **non-permanent member** of the United Nations Security Council, and has played an active role in international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts.\n- Argentina also has a **dispute** with the United Kingdom over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, which has been a source of tension between the two countries for many years.",
