[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Argentina is a vast and geographically diverse country, spanning across different climate zones. The country can be divided into four main climate regions: the subtropical north, the temperate central region, the arid desert of Patagonia, and the cold and wet Tierra del Fuego. The dry season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by dry and cold weather, while the wet season, from October to April, brings warm and humid weather. The seasons in Argentina have a significant impact on travel, as the weather can affect the accessibility of certain areas, such as the Patagonian region, which is best visited during the summer months. Additionally, the seasons influence the prices of accommodations and tourist services, with the peak season being the most expensive.

The spring season, from September to November, is a great time to visit Argentina, as the weather is mild and pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). The autumn season, from March to May, is also a good time to visit, with comfortable temperatures and fewer crowds. The summer months, from December to February, are the peak tourist season, with warm weather and long days, but also larger crowds and higher prices.

The winter months, from June to August, are the best time to visit the ski resorts in the Andes, such as Bariloche and Las Leñas, which offer world-class skiing and snowboarding. However, this period is also the low season for other tourist attractions, and some services may be limited.
