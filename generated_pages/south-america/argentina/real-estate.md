[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Argentine property market has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, with a mix of economic instability and currency fluctuations affecting prices and demand. Currently, the market is characterized by a surplus of properties for sale, leading to a buyer's market with relatively low prices. The urban areas, particularly Buenos Aires, tend to be more popular among investors and foreigners, while rural areas are often more affordable but with limited amenities and services. The price trajectory has been generally stable, with some areas experiencing a decline in prices due to the economic downturn. However, there are signs of recovery, with some neighborhoods and cities experiencing an increase in demand and prices.

The urban-rural divide is significant in Argentina, with cities like Buenos Aires and Cordoba offering a wide range of amenities, services, and job opportunities, while rural areas are often more traditional and agriculture-based. The property market reflects this divide, with urban areas tend to be more expensive and in demand, while rural areas are often more affordable but with limited investment potential. Despite the challenges, Argentina's property market offers opportunities for investors and foreigners, particularly in the rental market, where yields can be attractive.

The current market conditions are also influenced by the country's economic policies, including currency controls and restrictions on foreign exchange. These policies can affect the ability of foreigners to buy and sell properties, as well as the overall attractiveness of the market. However, the government has implemented measures to stimulate the economy and attract foreign investment, which could have a positive impact on the property market in the long term.
