[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Argentina's government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is elected by popular vote for a four-year term. The President is both the head of state and the head of government, and is responsible for appointing the cabinet and overseeing the administration of the government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Congress, which is a bicameral body made up of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The Senate has 72 seats, with three senators elected from each of the country's 24 provinces, while the Chamber of Deputies has 257 seats, with deputies elected from each province based on population. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, which are responsible for interpreting the constitution and federal laws.

The Argentine government is also divided into **federal** and **provincial** levels. The federal government is responsible for matters such as foreign policy, national defense, and economic policy, while the provincial governments have jurisdiction over matters such as education, healthcare, and law enforcement. This division of power is established by the **Constitution of Argentina**, which was adopted in 1853 and has been amended several times since then.

The Argentine political system is based on the principles of **representative democracy**, where citizens elect their representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The system is designed to provide a balance of power between the different branches of government, and to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. This is achieved through a system of **checks and balances**, where each branch has some ability to limit the actions of the other branches.
