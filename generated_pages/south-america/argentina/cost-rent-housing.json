Typical lease terms are for 12 months, with a two-month deposit required, which can be negotiated. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to understand the terms of the lease and the local regulations. Compared to regional neighbors, Argentina's housing costs are relatively high, especially in the city center. However, the cost of living in Argentina can be lower than in other countries in the region, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists.\n\nThe high inflation rate in Argentina, at 219.9% in 2024, has significantly impacted the housing market, with prices increasing rapidly. This has made it challenging for locals and expats to find affordable housing, especially in the city center. Additionally, the economic uncertainty has led to a decrease in the number of available rentals, making the market even more competitive. Despite these challenges, Argentina's housing market remains an attractive option for those looking for a unique cultural experience and a relatively low cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $500-$800 | $250-$500 | small, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$1,200 | $350-$700 | medium size, standard amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,000-$2,000 | $600-$1,200 | large size, good amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,500 | $800-$1,800 | spacious, high-end amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,000-$5,000 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$3,000 | residential areas, medium demand |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | countryside, low demand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Recoleta**: a upscale neighborhood in Buenos Aires, with rent ranges from $800 to $2,000 USD per month, known for its beautiful parks and high-end restaurants.\n- **Palermo**: a trendy neighborhood in Buenos Aires, with rent ranges from $600 to $1,500 USD per month, known for its vibrant nightlife and boutique shops.\n- **Belgrano**: a family-friendly neighborhood in Buenos Aires, with rent ranges from $500 to $1,200 USD per month, known for its beautiful parks and good schools.\n- **San Telmo**: a historic neighborhood in Buenos Aires, with rent ranges from $400 to $1,000 USD per month, known for its bohemian vibe and antique shops.\n- **Puerto Madero**: a modern neighborhood in Buenos Aires, with rent ranges from $1,000 to $3,000 USD per month, known for its stunning views of the Rio de la Plata and high-end amenities.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Argentina [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a trustworthy landlord and a fair price.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and the terms of the lease.\n- Make sure to inspect the property carefully before signing the lease.\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment, as this is a common practice in Argentina.\n- Be aware of the high inflation rate and the potential for rapid price increases. \n- Understand that utilities, such as electricity and water, are usually not included in the rent.",
