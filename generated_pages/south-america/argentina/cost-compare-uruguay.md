[SECTION] Overview: Argentina vs Uruguay [/SECTION]
Argentina and Uruguay are neighboring countries in South America, sharing a border and many cultural similarities. However, their economies and cost of living differ significantly. Argentina has a larger population and a more diverse economy, but it has also experienced higher inflation rates in recent years. Uruguay, on the other hand, has a smaller population and a more stable economy, but it also has a higher cost of living. Overall, Argentina is generally cheaper than Uruguay, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living.
