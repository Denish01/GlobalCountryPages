According to the GDP per capita PPP of $30,431, Argentina has a relatively high standard of living, but the high inflation rate of 219.9% can make it challenging to maintain a consistent budget. Compared to neighboring countries, Argentina is more expensive than Bolivia and Paraguay, but cheaper than Chile and Uruguay.

The different budgets will go a long way in Argentina, with a budget lifestyle allowing for a basic but comfortable life, a mid-range lifestyle providing more flexibility and comfort, and a comfortable lifestyle offering a high level of luxury and convenience. For example, a budget of $600-800 per month can cover the costs of a shared apartment, basic food and transportation, and some entertainment, while a mid-range budget of $1,200-1,800 per month can afford a one-bedroom apartment, more varied food options, and regular social activities.
