Argentina has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on services, industry, and agriculture, which can drive up prices for goods and services.

Additionally, the exchange rate between the two countries' currencies can also affect the cost of living, with the Argentine peso being more volatile than the Bolivian boliviano.
