[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Argentina is relatively competitive, with a wide range of options available in major cities like Buenos Aires. Typical lease terms are for 12 months, with a two-month deposit required, which can be negotiated. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to understand the terms of the lease and the local regulations. Compared to regional neighbors, Argentina's housing costs are relatively high, especially in the city center. However, the cost of living in Argentina can be lower than in other countries in the region, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists.

The high inflation rate in Argentina, at 219.9% in 2024, has significantly impacted the housing market, with prices increasing rapidly. This has made it challenging for locals and expats to find affordable housing, especially in the city center. Additionally, the economic uncertainty has led to a decrease in the number of available rentals, making the market even more competitive. Despite these challenges, Argentina's housing market remains an attractive option for those looking for a unique cultural experience and a relatively low cost of living.
