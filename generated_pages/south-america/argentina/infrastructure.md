# Argentina Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Argentina's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 99.2% of population
Internet Penetration: 71.4%
Road Network: 231,374 km, with 70% paved
Rail Network: 36,966 km
Major Airports: 11 international, 35 domestic
Major Ports: 11 major
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Argentina has a relatively well-developed infrastructure, with a strong focus on urban areas. The country has invested heavily in recent years to improve its roads, railways, and energy networks. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address these disparities, including the **National Infrastructure Plan**, which aims to invest over $30 billion in infrastructure projects over the next decade.

Despite these efforts, Argentina's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including aging systems, inadequate maintenance, and a lack of investment in certain sectors. The country's energy sector, for example, is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, and there is a need for greater investment in renewable energy sources. Additionally, the country's transportation network is often congested, particularly in urban areas, and there is a need for more efficient and sustainable solutions.

Argentina's infrastructure development is also hindered by a number of factors, including a complex and often bureaucratic regulatory framework, a lack of private sector investment, and a shortage of skilled workers. However, the government is working to address these challenges, and there are signs of progress, including an increase in foreign investment and a growing focus on **public-private partnerships**.
