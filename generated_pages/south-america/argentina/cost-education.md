[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Argentina is divided into public and private institutions, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools can be quite expensive. The **language of instruction** is Spanish, and the academic year typically runs from March to December. The education system is compulsory for 12 years, starting from primary school at the age of 6, followed by secondary school, and finally, tertiary education. The quality of education in public schools can vary, with some schools being well-regarded, while others may lack resources and have lower standards.
