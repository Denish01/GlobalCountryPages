The country's history as a Spanish colony has had a lasting impact on its language, customs, and architecture, with many Argentine cities featuring beautiful Spanish-style buildings and plazas. The indigenous peoples of Argentina, such as the Quechua and Guarani, have also made significant contributions to the country's cultural identity, particularly in the areas of music, dance, and handicrafts.\n\nThe majority of Argentines are of European descent, primarily from Spain and Italy, and the country's language, Spanish, is the primary language spoken. However, there are also significant communities of indigenous peoples, as well as immigrants from other parts of the world, including Africa and the Middle East. This diverse ethnic and linguistic makeup has created a vibrant and dynamic culture, with a wide range of customs, traditions, and cultural practices.\n\nArgentine culture is also known for its passion and expressiveness, with a strong emphasis on emotions, relationships, and personal connections. This is reflected in the country's famous tango music and dance, as well as its lively and expressive language, which is known for its rich vocabulary and poetic flair.
