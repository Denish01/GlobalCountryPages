  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Argentina can vary significantly, with a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment averaging around $150-200 USD, while internet plans with 60 Mbps speed can cost between $20-50 USD per month.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($175 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($15 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: ARS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nArgentina's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can be unstable and fluctuating due to the country's high inflation rate, which reached 219.9% in 2024. This means that utility bills can increase significantly over time, making it challenging for households to budget. Additionally, there can be seasonal variations in utility costs, with higher electricity and gas bills during the winter months (June to August) due to increased heating demand.\n\nThe quality of utility services can also vary depending on the region and provider. In general, urban areas like Buenos Aires tend to have more reliable and efficient utility services compared to rural areas. However, outages and disruptions can still occur, especially during peak demand periods or due to infrastructure issues. To mitigate these risks, households can consider investing in backup power systems or energy-efficient appliances.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $15 | $25 | $35 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$95** | **$150** | **$215** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 20 Mbps | Telefónica, Claro |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 100 Mbps | Telefónica, Claro |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | Movistar, Claro |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-40 | 10 GB | Movistar, Claro |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Telefónica, Claro |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Netflix Argentina) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's recommended to contact the provider directly or visit their website to schedule an appointment and provide the necessary documentation.\n- Consider opting for prepaid electricity plans to avoid unexpected bills and have more control over your energy consumption.\n- For internet services, Telefónica and Claro are popular providers offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, households can invest in energy-efficient appliances, use public transport, and reduce their water consumption.\n- Be aware of seasonal variations in utility costs and plan accordingly to avoid bill shocks during peak demand periods.",
