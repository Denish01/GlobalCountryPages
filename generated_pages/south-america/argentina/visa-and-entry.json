[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nArgentina has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country provides visa-free access to citizens of around 90 countries, including most European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan. This liberal approach to visa policy makes Argentina an attractive destination for tourists and business travelers alike. The country's visa policy is designed to promote tourism, trade, and cultural exchange, while also ensuring the security and integrity of its borders.\n\nArgentina's visa policy is divided into several categories, including tourist, business, student, and work visas. The requirements and regulations for each category vary, but the overall goal is to facilitate the entry and stay of foreign nationals in Argentina while maintaining national security and public order. Citizens of countries that do not have a visa-free agreement with Argentina may need to apply for a visa at an Argentine embassy or consulate before traveling to the country.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online for an electronic visa prior to travel |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online for an electronic visa prior to travel |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can stay in Argentina for up to 90 days without a visa, depending on their nationality.
