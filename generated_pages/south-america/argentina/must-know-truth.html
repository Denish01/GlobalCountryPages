        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Argentina's history began with the arrival of indigenous peoples, including the <strong>Inca Empire</strong>, around 1000 AD. The Spanish colonization of Argentina started in 1580, with the founding of Buenos Aires by Spanish conquistador <strong>Juan de Garay</strong>. The city became a major commercial center, and the Spanish established the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776, which included present-day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and parts of Bolivia, Brazil, and Chile. Argentina declared its independence from Spain on July 9, 1816, after a long process that began with the <strong>May Revolution</strong> in 1810.</p>
        <p>The country's early years were marked by power struggles and civil wars, including the <strong>War of the Triple Alliance</strong> (1864-1870) against Paraguay, which resulted in significant territorial gains for Argentina. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a massive influx of European immigrants, primarily from Italy and Spain, which shaped the country's culture and identity. Argentina became one of the wealthiest countries in the world during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with a strong <strong>agricultural sector</strong> and a growing industrial base.</p>
        <p>The 20th century was marked by periods of military rule, including the <strong>Dirty War</strong> (1976-1983), during which thousands of people disappeared or were killed by the military regime. Argentina returned to democracy in 1983, with the election of <strong>Raúl Alfonsín</strong> as president. The country has since experienced periods of economic growth and crisis, including the <strong>2001 economic crisis</strong>, which led to widespread protests and the resignation of President <strong>Fernando de la Rúa</strong>.</p>
        <p>Today, Argentina is a <strong>federal republic</strong> with a president serving as both head of state and head of government. The country has a diverse economy, with major industries including <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>mining</strong>, and <strong>manufacturing</strong>. Argentina is also a member of the <strong>Mercosur</strong> trading bloc and the <strong>G20</strong> group of major economies.</p>

Visitors should still take normal precautions to ensure their safety, such as avoiding traveling alone at night and using reputable transportation services. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Argentina's economy is in constant crisis"</p>

[/CALLOUT]</p>
