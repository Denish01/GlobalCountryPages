The cost of eating out is relatively high, with a meal at a mid-range restaurant costing around $30-$50 USD for two people. In contrast, home cooking is a more affordable option, with a monthly grocery budget for one person ranging from $100-$200 USD. The eating-out culture in Venezuela is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals opting to cook at home due to the high costs of dining out.\n\nThe prices of food in Venezuela are also affected by the **black market exchange rate**, which can fluctuate wildly, making it difficult to predict the cost of goods. Additionally, the **shortage of basic goods** has led to a reliance on **imported products**, which are often more expensive than local alternatives. As a result, many Venezuelans have had to adapt their eating habits, opting for **traditional dishes** made with locally sourced ingredients, such as **arepas**, **cachapas**, and **tequeños**.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2-$3 | 10,000-15,000 VES | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1-$2 | 5,000-10,000 VES | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $3-$5 | 15,000-25,000 VES | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 5,000-10,000 VES | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $5-$10 | 25,000-50,000 VES | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10-$20 | 50,000-100,000 VES | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5-$10 | 25,000-50,000 VES | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2-$5 | 10,000-25,000 VES | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 5,000-10,000 VES | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1-$2 | 5,000-10,000 VES | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10-$20 | 50,000-100,000 VES | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-$2 | 5,000-10,000 VES | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (typical dishes like arepas, cachapas) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | (one person, basic meal) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-$50 | (3 courses, moderate quality) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, high-quality ingredients) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$10 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $10-$20 | |\n| Cappuccino | $5-$10 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$5 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of goods at supermarkets and local markets in Venezuela can vary significantly.
