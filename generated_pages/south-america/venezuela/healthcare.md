[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Venezuela's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public healthcare system is free, but it has been struggling with funding and resource shortages, leading to a decline in the quality of care. In contrast, the private sector offers better quality care, but it is expensive and out of reach for many Venezuelans. Urban areas, such as Caracas, have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often lack basic medical facilities and personnel. The quality of care in Venezuela has been affected by the country's economic crisis, with shortages of medical supplies, equipment, and personnel.

The public healthcare system in Venezuela is managed by the Ministry of Health, which oversees a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers. However, the system has been criticized for being inefficient and corrupt, with long waiting times and inadequate care. The private sector, on the other hand, offers a range of healthcare services, from basic medical care to specialized treatments, but it is often expensive and requires private insurance.

Despite the challenges, there are efforts to improve the healthcare system in Venezuela, including initiatives to increase funding and resources for public healthcare providers. However, the country still faces significant challenges in providing quality healthcare to its population, particularly in rural areas.
