[SECTION] How Venezuela Is Divided [/SECTION]
Venezuela's administrative structure is composed of 23 states, each with its own capital and a set of municipalities. The states are further divided into municipalities, which are the basic units of local government. The capital district, which includes the city of Caracas, has a special status and is not part of any state. Additionally, Venezuela has a set of federal dependencies, which are a group of islands and territories that are not part of any state. This administrative structure allows for a degree of autonomy and regional governance, while also maintaining a strong central government.

The division of Venezuela into states and municipalities has historical and geographical roots. The country's geography is characterized by a mix of coastal regions, mountains, and plains, which has led to the development of distinct regional identities and economies. The Andes Mountains run along the western edge of the country, while the Orinoco River flows through the eastern part of the country, creating a diverse range of ecosystems and landscapes.
