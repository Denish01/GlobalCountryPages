# Venezuela Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Venezuela's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated facilities, with significant challenges in the areas of power, water, and telecommunications, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 95% of population
Internet Penetration: 60%
Road Network: 96,000 km, with varying quality and maintenance
Rail Network: 447 km
Major Airports: 11
Major Ports: 7
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Venezuela's infrastructure development level is moderate, with significant investments made in the past, particularly in the oil and gas sector. However, in recent years, the country has faced significant challenges, including a severe economic crisis, which has affected the maintenance and development of its infrastructure. The urban-rural gap is notable, with cities like Caracas and Maracaibo having relatively better infrastructure, while rural areas often lack access to basic services like electricity, water, and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, but progress has been slow due to funding constraints and other factors.

The country's infrastructure has also been affected by the decline of the oil industry, which has historically been the main driver of the economy. The government has been working to diversify the economy and attract foreign investment, but the process has been slow. Despite these challenges, Venezuela has made significant progress in areas like education and healthcare, with a strong emphasis on social programs and poverty reduction.

In recent years, the government has launched several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and public transportation systems. However, these efforts have been hindered by a lack of funding and resources, as well as a shortage of skilled labor. As a result, many of these projects have been delayed or put on hold, leaving the country's infrastructure in a state of disrepair.
