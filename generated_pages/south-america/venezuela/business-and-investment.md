[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Venezuela's business environment is characterized by a complex and often unpredictable regulatory framework, which can make it difficult for foreign investors to navigate. The government has historically been skeptical of foreign investment, and the country's economic crisis has led to a decline in the ease of doing business.

Additionally, the country's **hyperinflation** and **currency controls** have made it challenging for businesses to operate efficiently.

The government has implemented various policies aimed at attracting foreign investment, including the creation of **special economic zones** and the introduction of **investment promotion agencies**. However, these efforts have been hindered by the country's economic crisis and the lack of a clear and consistent investment policy.
