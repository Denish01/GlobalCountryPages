[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Venezuela is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is directly elected by the people for a six-year term. The President has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the **Cabinet** and other high-ranking officials. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, a unicameral body with 277 seats. Members of the National Assembly are also directly elected by the people for five-year terms. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, which is composed of 32 judges appointed by the National Assembly.

The Venezuelan government is characterized by a **unitary system**, where the central government holds significant power and authority. However, the country is divided into 23 states, each with its own governor and legislature. The states have some degree of autonomy, but the central government retains significant control over key areas such as taxation, education, and healthcare. The **separation of powers** is established in the Venezuelan Constitution, which provides for an independent judiciary and a system of checks and balances between the branches of government.

The Venezuelan political system has been marked by controversy and instability in recent years, with allegations of **authoritarianism** and **electoral manipulation**. The government has been criticized for its handling of the economy, human rights, and the rule of law. Despite these challenges, the government has maintained a significant level of popular support, particularly among the poor and working-class sectors of society.
