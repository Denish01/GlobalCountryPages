[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Venezuela is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest and most accessible. However, the quality of education in public schools is often compromised due to a lack of resources and infrastructure, making private schools a more attractive option for those who can afford it. The language of instruction in Venezuelan schools is **Spanish**, and education is compulsory for 12 years, from primary to secondary level. International schools are also available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including **American**, **British**, and **International Baccalaureate**.

The quality of education in Venezuela has been affected by the country's economic crisis, with many public schools facing shortages of teachers, textbooks, and other resources. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but are often expensive and out of reach for many Venezuelans. International schools offer a high-quality education, but are typically very expensive and cater to the children of expatriates and wealthy locals.
