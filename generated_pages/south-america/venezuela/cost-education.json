However, the quality of education in public schools is often compromised due to a lack of resources and infrastructure, making private schools a more attractive option for those who can afford it. The language of instruction in Venezuelan schools is **Spanish**, and education is compulsory for 12 years, from primary to secondary level. International schools are also available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including **American**, **British**, and **International Baccalaureate**.\n\nThe quality of education in Venezuela has been affected by the country's economic crisis, with many public schools facing shortages of teachers, textbooks, and other resources.
