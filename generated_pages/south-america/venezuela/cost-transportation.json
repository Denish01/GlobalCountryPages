The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Caracas having a more comprehensive network of buses and metro lines. However, the lack of investment in the transportation sector has led to a decline in the quality of services, making it challenging for people to get around, especially in rural areas.\n\nIn recent years, the economic crisis in Venezuela has had a significant impact on the transportation sector, with fuel shortages and a lack of maintenance leading to a decline in the number of vehicles on the road. As a result, many people have turned to **alternative modes of transportation**, such as bicycles and motorcycles, to get around. Despite these challenges, the Venezuelan government has been working to improve the transportation system, with plans to invest in new infrastructure and vehicles.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage, often overcrowded |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.50-$1.00 | $15-$30 | Available in Caracas, limited hours |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Common, but often unregulated |\n| Commuter Train | $2.00-$5.00 | $20-$50 | Limited routes, often delayed |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5.00-$10.00 | $1.00-$2.00 | $10.00-$20.00 | Often unavailable |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $3.00-$5.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Cabify and Easy Taxi available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20.00-$50.00 | To city center, often prepaid |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.50-$1.00 | Fuel shortages common |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.50-$1.00 | Often used for buses and trucks |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $20-$50 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Often limited, can be expensive |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2.00-$5.00 | Limited, often in disrepair |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$30.00 | Often delayed, limited comfort |\n| Domestic Flight | $50.00-$100.00 | Limited routes, often expensive |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20.00-$50.00 | Limited routes, often delayed |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be prepared for **long wait times** and **overcrowding** on public transportation, especially during peak hours.\n- Consider using **ride-hailing apps** like Cabify and Easy Taxi for a more convenient and affordable option.\n- **Negotiate taxi fares** before starting your journey, as meters are often unavailable.\n- Be aware of **safety concerns**, especially at night, and avoid traveling alone in unfamiliar areas.\n- Use **official airport transfer services** to avoid scams and ensure a safe and reliable journey to your destination.\n- Consider **budgeting extra** for transportation costs, as prices can vary greatly depending on the mode of transport and location.",
