Despite these challenges, Venezuela's population is known for its resilience and adaptability, with many people finding ways to cope with the difficulties and uncertainties of everyday life.\n\nThe country's population growth rate has been affected by various factors, including a decline in fertility rates and an increase in mortality rates, particularly among children and young adults.
