[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Venezuela has a mixed economy, with a significant public sector and a large informal market. The country's economy has been classified as upper-middle income, but it has been experiencing a severe economic crisis since 2013, characterized by high inflation, scarcity of goods, and a significant decline in GDP. The economic trajectory of Venezuela has been heavily influenced by its oil industry, with the country being one of the largest oil producers in the world. However, the economy's over-reliance on oil exports has made it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.

The development level of Venezuela's economy has been hindered by a range of factors, including corruption, mismanagement, and a lack of investment in key sectors such as infrastructure and education. The country's economic classification as upper-middle income is largely based on its oil wealth, but the standard of living for many Venezuelans has declined significantly in recent years. The economic crisis has also led to a significant brain drain, with many skilled professionals leaving the country in search of better opportunities.

The Venezuelan government has implemented a range of policies aimed at addressing the economic crisis, including price controls and currency restrictions. However, these policies have had limited success and have often exacerbated the problems they were intended to solve. The country's economic outlook remains uncertain, with many predicting a long and difficult road to recovery.
