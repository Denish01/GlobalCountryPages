[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Venezuela has a mixed economy, with a significant role for the state in key sectors such as oil and gas, but also a large private sector. The country's economy has been classified as upper-middle income, but its development level has been hindered by a range of factors, including corruption, mismanagement, and a lack of economic diversification. Venezuela's economy has been on a downward trajectory in recent years, with a severe economic crisis that has led to hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages, and a significant decline in living standards.

The country's economy has been heavily dependent on oil exports, which have accounted for the majority of its export earnings. However, the decline in oil prices in recent years has had a significant impact on the economy, leading to a sharp decline in government revenues and a severe economic crisis. The government has implemented a range of policies aimed at addressing the crisis, including currency controls, price controls, and subsidies, but these have had limited success.

Venezuela's economy is also characterized by a large informal sector, with many businesses operating outside of the formal economy. This has made it difficult for the government to collect taxes and regulate economic activity, and has contributed to the country's economic challenges.
