  "content": "Venezuela's economy is a complex and struggling system, driven primarily by its oil industry, but facing significant challenges due to mismanagement, corruption, and external factors. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($42 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($1,542 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Upper-Middle)\nMain Industries: Oil, Manufacturing, Agriculture\nCurrency: VES\nUnemployment Rate: (approximately 44%)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 188 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nVenezuela has a mixed economy, with a significant public sector and a large informal market. The country's economy has been classified as upper-middle income, but it has been experiencing a severe economic crisis since 2013, characterized by high inflation, scarcity of goods, and a significant decline in GDP. The economic trajectory of Venezuela has been heavily influenced by its oil industry, with the country being one of the largest oil producers in the world. However, the economy's over-reliance on oil exports has made it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.\n\nThe development level of Venezuela's economy has been hindered by a range of factors, including corruption, mismanagement, and a lack of investment in key sectors such as infrastructure and education. The country's economic classification as upper-middle income is largely based on its oil wealth, but the standard of living for many Venezuelans has declined significantly in recent years. The economic crisis has also led to a significant brain drain, with many skilled professionals leaving the country in search of better opportunities.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has implemented a range of policies aimed at addressing the economic crisis, including price controls and currency restrictions. However, these policies have had limited success and have often exacerbated the problems they were intended to solve. The country's economic outlook remains uncertain, with many predicting a long and difficult road to recovery.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Oil | 90% of exports | Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world and oil is the main driver of the economy |\n| Manufacturing | 15% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is largely focused on food processing and textiles |\n| Agriculture | 5% of GDP | The agricultural sector is small but significant, with products such as coffee, cocoa, and sugarcane being major exports |\n| Services | 60% of GDP | The services sector is the largest sector of the economy, with a significant focus on financial services and tourism |\n| Mining | 2% of GDP | Venezuela has significant mineral reserves, including gold, iron, and bauxite |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Oil**: the main driver of Venezuela's economy, with the majority of exports going to the United States and China\n- **Aluminum**: Venezuela is a significant producer of aluminum, with exports going to countries such as the United States and Japan\n- **Iron**: Venezuela has significant iron ore reserves, with exports going to countries such as China and India\n- **Cocoa**: Venezuela is a significant producer of cocoa, with exports going to countries such as the Netherlands and Germany\n- **Coffee**: Venezuela is a significant producer of coffee, with exports going to countries such as the United States and Italy\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food**: due to the economic crisis, Venezuela has had to import significant amounts of food, including staples such as wheat and corn\n- **Machinery**: Venezuela imports significant amounts of machinery, including equipment for the oil and manufacturing sectors\n- **Transportation equipment**: the country imports significant amounts of transportation equipment, including cars and trucks\n- **Electronics**: Venezuela imports significant amounts of electronics, including computers and smartphones\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: due to the economic crisis, Venezuela has had to import significant amounts of pharmaceuticals, including medicines and medical equipment\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- United States: the United States is Venezuela's largest trading partner, with the majority of oil exports going to the US\n- China: China is a significant trading partner, with Venezuela importing significant amounts of goods such as machinery and electronics\n- Colombia: Colombia is a significant trading partner, with Venezuela importing significant amounts of food and other goods\n- Brazil: Brazil is a significant trading partner, with Venezuela importing significant amounts of goods such as machinery and transportation equipment\n- Mexico: Mexico is a significant trading partner, with Venezuela importing significant amounts of goods such as food and pharmaceuticals\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The transportation network in Venezuela is relatively underdeveloped, with a lack of investment in roads, bridges, and public transportation\n- The energy sector is dominated by the state-owned oil company, with a significant focus on oil production and export\n- Internet and mobile penetration is relatively high, with over 60% of the population having access to the internet\n- The country has a number of significant ports, including the port of La Guaira and the port of Puerto Cabello\n- The international airport in Caracas is a major hub for flights to and from Venezuela, with connections to major cities in the Americas and Europe\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe economic outlook for Venezuela remains uncertain, with many predicting a long and difficult road to recovery.
