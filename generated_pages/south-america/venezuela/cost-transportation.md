[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Venezuela has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on **informal transportation** modes such as shared taxis and minibus services. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Caracas having a more comprehensive network of buses and metro lines. However, the lack of investment in the transportation sector has led to a decline in the quality of services, making it challenging for people to get around, especially in rural areas.

In recent years, the economic crisis in Venezuela has had a significant impact on the transportation sector, with fuel shortages and a lack of maintenance leading to a decline in the number of vehicles on the road. As a result, many people have turned to **alternative modes of transportation**, such as bicycles and motorcycles, to get around. Despite these challenges, the Venezuelan government has been working to improve the transportation system, with plans to invest in new infrastructure and vehicles.
