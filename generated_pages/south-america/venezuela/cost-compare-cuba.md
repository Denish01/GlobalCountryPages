[SECTION] Overview: Venezuela vs Cuba [/SECTION]
Venezuela and Cuba are two countries in the Americas with distinct economic contexts. Venezuela, a major oil producer, has been facing significant economic challenges in recent years, including hyperinflation and a decline in living standards. Cuba, on the other hand, has a socialist economy with a strong emphasis on social welfare and government control. Despite these differences, both countries offer a unique cultural experience and a relatively low cost of living compared to other countries in the region. Venezuela's cost of living is generally lower than Cuba's, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Venezuela's hyperinflation has led to a significant devaluation of the local currency, making imports and foreign goods extremely expensive. Cuba, on the other hand, has a more stable economy, but the government's control over the economy and the lack of private enterprise have limited the availability of certain goods and services. As a result, Cuba's cost of living is generally higher than Venezuela's, especially when it comes to accommodation and food. However, Cuba's stronger social safety net and more stable economy make it an attractive option for expats and retirees looking for a relaxed and affordable lifestyle.
