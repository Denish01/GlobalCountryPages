  "content": "The population of Bolivia is a diverse and multicultural society, with a mix of indigenous, European, and African influences, totaling around 12.1 million people.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 12.1 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 1.4%\nMedian Age: 23.5 years\nUrban Population: 69%\nPopulation Density: 10.3 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 71.5 years\nFertility Rate: 2.3 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nBolivia's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in South America, but it has been growing steadily over the years. The population growth rate is approximately 1.4%, which is slightly higher than the regional average. The country's urban population accounts for around 69% of the total population, with the majority residing in cities such as La Paz, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba. Urbanization has been a significant trend in Bolivia, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Migration patterns also play a crucial role in shaping the country's demographics, with many Bolivians migrating to neighboring countries such as Argentina and Chile for work.\n\nThe population of Bolivia is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 23.5 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is in the workforce or dependent on their families. The population density is relatively low, with an average of 10.3 people per square kilometer, which is one of the lowest in South America. Despite these challenges, Bolivia has made significant progress in improving living standards and reducing poverty over the years.\n\nThe country's population is also influenced by its geography, with the Andean highlands and the Amazon rainforest covering a significant portion of the country. The climate and terrain have shaped the population's distribution, with many people living in the valleys and lowlands. The government has implemented policies to promote sustainable development and reduce poverty in rural areas, but more needs to be done to address the significant disparities between urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Quechua | 30% | Western highlands | Largest indigenous group |\n| Aymara | 25% | Western highlands | Second-largest indigenous group |\n| Mestizo | 30% | Throughout the country | Mixed European and indigenous ancestry |\n| Guarani | 5% | Eastern lowlands | Indigenous group with their own language and culture |\n| Chiquitano | 2% | Eastern lowlands | Indigenous group with their own language and culture |\n| Afro-Bolivian | 1% | Throughout the country | Descendants of African slaves |\n| European | 5% | Throughout the country | Mainly of Spanish and Italian descent |\n[/TABLE]\nBolivia is a multicultural and multilingual country, with a diverse range of ethnic groups.
