[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Bolivia's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being generally free or subsidized, but often lacking in quality and resources. The language of instruction is primarily Spanish, although some schools may offer classes in Quechua or Aymara, the two main indigenous languages spoken in the country. Compulsory education lasts for 12 years, starting from the age of 5, and is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the British GCSE.

The quality of education in Bolivia varies greatly depending on the institution and location. Public schools in rural areas often struggle with limited resources and lack of qualified teachers, while private schools in urban areas tend to offer better facilities and instruction. International schools, on the other hand, cater to expats and wealthy locals, offering a high-quality education with a range of extracurricular activities and modern facilities. Despite the challenges, the Bolivian government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding and implementing new programs to support disadvantaged students.
