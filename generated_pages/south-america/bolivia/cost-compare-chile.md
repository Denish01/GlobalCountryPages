[SECTION] Overview: Bolivia vs Chile [/SECTION]
Bolivia and Chile are two neighboring countries in South America with distinct economic contexts. Bolivia is a developing country with a growing economy, while Chile is a more developed country with a high-income economy. The cost of living in Bolivia is significantly lower than in Chile, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees. The main reason for this difference is the lower cost of housing, food, and transportation in Bolivia. Additionally, Bolivia's economy is more informal, which means that many goods and services are cheaper due to the lack of taxes and regulations.
