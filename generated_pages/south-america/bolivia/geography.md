[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Bolivia is a landlocked country located in the heart of South America, bordered by five countries: Brazil to the north and east, Paraguay to the southeast, Argentina to the south, Chile to the southwest, and Peru to the northwest. The country's unique location, nestled in the center of the continent, has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and geography. Bolivia's borders are defined by a combination of natural features, such as rivers and mountains, and artificial boundaries established through treaties and agreements with its neighboring countries.

The country's location in the center of South America has also made it a crossroads for trade and cultural exchange between the region's major powers. The **Andes Mountains**, which stretch through western Bolivia, have historically served as a barrier to east-west trade, while the **Amazon Basin** in the north and the **Chaco Desert** in the southeast have provided routes for cultural and economic exchange with neighboring countries. Bolivia's borders are also home to several important rivers, including the **Beni River**, the **Mamoré River**, and the **Pilcomayo River**, which flow into the **Paraguay River** and ultimately into the **Paraná River** in Argentina.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Bolivia's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, from the **Andes Mountains** in the west to the **Amazon Basin** in the north and the **Chaco Desert** in the southeast. The country's western region is dominated by the **Cordillera Occidental**, a mountain range that includes some of the highest peaks in the Andes, such as **Nevado Sajama**, the country's highest point. The **Altiplano**, a high-altitude plateau, stretches across western Bolivia and is home to several important cities, including **La Paz**, the country's administrative capital, and **Oruro**, a major mining center.

The **Amazon Basin**, which covers nearly one-third of Bolivia's territory, is a region of lush tropical rainforest, home to a vast array of plant and animal species. The **Beni River** and its tributaries flow through the region, providing a transportation route for goods and people. In contrast, the **Chaco Desert** in the southeast is a dry and sparsely populated region, characterized by **thorny scrub** and **cacti**. The **Gran Chaco**, as it is known in Bolivia, is also home to several indigenous communities, who have developed unique cultures and traditions adapted to the harsh desert environment.

The country's landscape is also dotted with numerous **lakes** and **salt flats**, including the **Salar de Uyuni**, the world's largest salt flat, which is located in southwestern Bolivia. The **Salar de Uyuni** is a popular tourist destination, known for its stunning **landscape** and **unique wildlife**. The **lake** region, which includes **Lake Titicaca**, the highest navigable lake in the world, is home to several important cities, including **Copacabana** and **Tiquina**.
