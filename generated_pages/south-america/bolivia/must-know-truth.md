# The Truth About Bolivia - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Bolivia, officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, has a rich and complex history that spans over 2,000 years. The earliest known civilizations in the region date back to the **Tiahuanaco** culture, which flourished from 300 to 1000 AD. The **Inca Empire** later expanded into the region, and Bolivia became an important center for trade and commerce. The Spanish colonization of Bolivia began in the 16th century, with the founding of the city of **Sucre** in 1538. Bolivia declared its independence from Spain on August 6, 1825, and has since been a sovereign state.

The country's early years of independence were marked by turmoil and instability, with various factions vying for power. The **War of the Pacific** (1879-1884) against Chile resulted in the loss of Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean, and the country has since been a landlocked nation. Throughout the 20th century, Bolivia experienced periods of military rule, followed by democratic reforms and economic instability. In 2009, Bolivia adopted a new constitution, which established the country as a **plurinational state**, recognizing the rights and autonomy of its various indigenous groups.

The country's history has been shaped by its **geography**, with the Andes Mountains running through the western part of the country and the Amazon rainforest covering much of the eastern region. The **Altiplano**, a high-altitude plateau, is home to the largest population centers, including the cities of La Paz and Sucre. Bolivia's diverse geography has supported a wide range of cultures and ecosystems, and the country is home to over 30 different **indigenous groups**, each with their own language and traditions.

Bolivia's **economic history** has been marked by periods of growth and decline, with the country's economy traditionally based on **mining** and **agriculture**. The country has significant reserves of **tin**, **copper**, and **lithium**, and mining has long been a major sector of the economy.
