[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Bolivia has a range of transportation options, including public buses, minibuses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities like La Paz and Santa Cruz having more comprehensive and efficient systems. In rural areas, transportation options are limited, and many people rely on **colectivos** (shared taxis) or **trufis** (minibuses) to get around. Most people in Bolivia get around using public transportation, which is relatively affordable, with a single fare on a city bus costing around $0.20-$0.30 USD.

The country's geography, with its rugged terrain and high altitudes, can make transportation challenging, especially in rural areas. However, the government has invested in improving the road network, and many cities have modernized their public transportation systems. In La Paz, for example, the **Teleférico** (cable car) system provides a convenient and scenic way to get around the city, with stunning views of the surrounding mountains.
