  "content": "Bolivia's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant gaps between urban and rural areas, and recent investments have focused on improving the country's transportation network, energy generation, and telecommunications.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 90% of population\nInternet Penetration: 40%\nRoad Network: 62,479 km, mostly unpaved and in moderate condition\nRail Network: 3,504 km\nMajor Airports: 16\nMajor Ports: 0, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nBolivia's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in South America. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in transportation, energy, and telecommunications. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on improving the lives of rural communities. Despite these efforts, Bolivia's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including inadequate funding, corruption, and a lack of maintenance.\n\nThe government has been investing in various infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and highways. These projects have improved connectivity between urban centers and have facilitated the transportation of goods and people. Additionally, the government has been working to expand access to electricity and clean water, particularly in rural areas. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps that exist in the country. Bolivia's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, which can have a significant impact on the country's economy and population.\n\nBolivia's infrastructure is also influenced by its geography, with the country's mountainous terrain making it difficult to build and maintain roads and other infrastructure. The country's landlocked location also presents challenges, as it relies on neighboring countries for access to ports and international trade. Despite these challenges, Bolivia has been working to develop its infrastructure, with a focus on improving the country's competitiveness and attracting foreign investment.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 62,479 km | Moderate | Mostly unpaved, with some paved highways connecting major cities |\n| Railways | 3,504 km | Poor | Limited passenger service, mostly used for freight transport |\n| Airports | 16 international, 30 domestic | Good | Modern airports in major cities, with some smaller airports in rural areas |\n| Ports | 0, landlocked | N/A | Relies on neighboring countries for access to ports and international trade |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Bolivia's power generation is mostly based on **thermal energy**, with some **hydroelectric** and **natural gas** sources.\n- The country's energy sector is characterized by a lack of **renewable energy** sources, with some progress being made in the development of **solar** and **wind energy**.\n- Electricity access is available to around 90% of the population, with some rural areas still lacking access to reliable electricity.\n- The country's energy grid is vulnerable to **outages** and **blackouts**, particularly during periods of high demand.\n- Bolivia has been working to improve its energy security, with investments in new power plants and transmission lines.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is not always safe to drink, particularly in rural areas, where **waterborne diseases** are a significant concern.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is around 50%, with many rural areas lacking access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** is a significant challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on **rainwater collection** and **wells**.\n- The government has been working to improve access to **clean water** and **sanitation**, with investments in new water treatment plants and sanitation infrastructure.\n- **Water conservation** is a significant concern in Bolivia, particularly in areas where **drought** is a recurring problem.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is available to around 80% of the population, with some rural areas still lacking access to reliable mobile services.\n- **Fiber optic** and **broadband** services are available in major cities, with some progress being made in expanding these services to rural areas.\n- **4G** and **5G** services are available in some areas, with the government working to expand these services to the rest of the country.\n- **Postal services** are available, but are not always reliable, particularly in rural areas.\n- Bolivia has been working to improve its **telecommunications infrastructure**, with investments in new fiber optic cables and mobile networks.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has been working on a major **highway construction project**, which aims to improve connectivity between major cities and facilitate the transportation of goods and people.\n- A new **hydroelectric power plant** is being built, which will provide a significant boost to the country's energy generation capacity.\n- The government has also been investing in **water and sanitation infrastructure**, with a focus on improving access to clean water and sanitation in rural areas.\n- A new **airport** is being built in the city of Santa Cruz, which will provide a significant boost to the country's air transport capacity.\n- The government has also been working on a major **telecommunications project**, which aims to expand access to mobile and broadband services in rural areas.",
