[SECTION] How Bolivia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Bolivia is divided into 9 departments, which are further subdivided into provinces and municipalities. The country's administrative structure is based on a decentralized system, with each department having its own capital and a degree of autonomy. The departments are: Beni, Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, La Paz, Oruro, Pando, Potosi, Santa Cruz, and Tarija. This division allows for more effective governance and management of the country's diverse regions.

The departments are characterized by their unique cultural, economic, and geographical features. For example, the department of Santa Cruz is known for its tropical climate and agricultural production, while the department of La Paz is home to the country's highest peak, Mount Illimani, and a thriving cultural scene. This diversity is reflected in the country's linguistic and cultural heritage, with over 30 indigenous languages spoken across the departments.

Bolivia has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights connecting major cities, and a comprehensive system of buses and trains. The country's road network is extensive, but driving conditions can be challenging, especially in rural areas. The most popular mode of transportation is by bus, with many companies offering frequent services between major cities. For shorter distances, taxis and colectivos (shared minivans) are widely available. In larger cities, such as La Paz and Santa Cruz, there are also modern airports with international connections. However, travel times can be long, especially when traveling between departments, and visitors should be prepared for delays and changes in schedules.
