[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Bolivia: May, June, July, August, September, and October. Peak season: June, July, and August. Budget season: April, May, and September.

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Bolivia has a diverse climate, with three main climate zones: the **Altiplano**, the **Yungas**, and the **Chaco**. The Altiplano, where the capital city of Sucre and La Paz are located, has a dry and cold climate, with two distinct seasons: the dry season, from May to October, and the wet season, from November to April. The Yungas, a region of subtropical valleys, has a more humid climate, with significant rainfall during the wet season. The Chaco, a region of grasslands and savannas, has a hot and dry climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The dry season is the best time to visit Bolivia, as the weather is mild and sunny, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, trekking, and visiting the **Salar de Uyuni**.

The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as heavy rainfall and potential flooding can make roads impassable and limit access to certain areas. However, the wet season is also a great time to see the country's beautiful **waterfalls** and **lakes**, which are at their peak during this time. The transition from wet to dry season, in March and April, can bring unpredictable weather, with sudden changes in temperature and precipitation. The dry season, from May to October, is the peak tourist season, with clear skies, mild temperatures, and low humidity, making it ideal for visiting the country's many **national parks** and **cultural attractions**.

The country's geography and climate also affect the best time to visit different regions. The **Andean highlands**, where the capital cities of Sucre and La Paz are located, have a dry and cold climate, with significant rainfall during the wet season. The **Amazon rainforest**, which covers a significant portion of eastern Bolivia, has a hot and humid climate, with heavy rainfall throughout the year. The **desert regions**, such as the **Atacama Desert**, have a hot and dry climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year.
