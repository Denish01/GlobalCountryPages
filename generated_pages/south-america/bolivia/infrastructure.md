# Bolivia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Bolivia's infrastructure is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant gaps between urban and rural areas, and recent investments have focused on improving the country's transportation network, energy generation, and telecommunications.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 90% of population
Internet Penetration: 40%
Road Network: 62,479 km, mostly unpaved and in moderate condition
Rail Network: 3,504 km
Major Airports: 16
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Bolivia's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in South America. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with investments in transportation, energy, and telecommunications. However, there is still a significant urban-rural gap, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address these disparities, with a focus on improving the lives of rural communities. Despite these efforts, Bolivia's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including inadequate funding, corruption, and a lack of maintenance.

The government has been investing in various infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and highways. These projects have improved connectivity between urban centers and have facilitated the transportation of goods and people. Additionally, the government has been working to expand access to electricity and clean water, particularly in rural areas. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps that exist in the country. Bolivia's infrastructure is also vulnerable to natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, which can have a significant impact on the country's economy and population.

Bolivia's infrastructure is also influenced by its geography, with the country's mountainous terrain making it difficult to build and maintain roads and other infrastructure. The country's landlocked location also presents challenges, as it relies on neighboring countries for access to ports and international trade. Despite these challenges, Bolivia has been working to develop its infrastructure, with a focus on improving the country's competitiveness and attracting foreign investment.
