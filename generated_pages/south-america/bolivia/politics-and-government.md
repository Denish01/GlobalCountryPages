[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Bolivian government is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a five-year term and is limited to two consecutive terms. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, a bicameral body consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Senators. The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court, which is responsible for interpreting the constitution and ensuring the rule of law.

The Bolivian political system is also characterized by a **decentralized** system of government, with significant autonomy granted to the country's nine departments. This decentralization has helped to promote regional development and reduce the concentration of power in the capital city. However, it has also created challenges in terms of coordination and cooperation between the national and regional governments.

The Bolivian constitution also recognizes the rights of **indigenous peoples**, who make up a significant proportion of the population. The constitution establishes the principle of **plurinationality**, which recognizes the diversity of cultures and languages in the country and promotes the participation of indigenous peoples in the political process.
