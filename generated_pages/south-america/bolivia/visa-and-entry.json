Currently, citizens of over 50 countries can enter Bolivia without a visa, including the United States, Canada, and most European countries. However, the length of stay and requirements may vary depending on the nationality and purpose of the visit. Bolivia is a popular destination for tourists, with its rich cultural heritage and natural beauty, and the government has implemented measures to facilitate travel while maintaining national security.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate international travel and tourism with the need to ensure the security and integrity of the country's borders. Bolivia has a diverse range of visa options, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and conditions. The government regularly reviews and updates its visa policy to reflect changing circumstances and to ensure that it remains effective in achieving its objectives.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 90 days |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 90 days |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 90 days |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 90 days |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 30 days | Can extend stay up to 90 days |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Bolivia visa-free, with a maximum stay of 30 days, which can be extended up to 90 days.
