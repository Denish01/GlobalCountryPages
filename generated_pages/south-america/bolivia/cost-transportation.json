The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities like La Paz and Santa Cruz having more comprehensive and efficient systems. In rural areas, transportation options are limited, and many people rely on **colectivos** (shared taxis) or **trufis** (minibuses) to get around. Most people in Bolivia get around using public transportation, which is relatively affordable, with a single fare on a city bus costing around $0.20-$0.30 USD.\n\nThe country's geography, with its rugged terrain and high altitudes, can make transportation challenging, especially in rural areas. However, the government has invested in improving the road network, and many cities have modernized their public transportation systems. In La Paz, for example, the **Teleférico** (cable car) system provides a convenient and scenic way to get around the city, with stunning views of the surrounding mountains.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.25 | $20 | Good coverage in larger cities |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in most cities |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50 | N/A | Limited routes, but convenient for short trips |\n| Commuter Train | $1-$2 | $30 | Limited availability, mostly in La Paz and Santa Cruz |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $3-$5 | Available in most cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2 | $0.50 | $4-$6 | Uber and Cabify available in larger cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.70 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.60 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on the rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options in larger cities |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads, mostly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Depending on the route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Typical route, e.g., La Paz to Santa Cruz |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited availability, mostly on tourist routes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or **colectivos** for shorter trips.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Cabify for convenient and affordable rides in larger cities.\n- Always negotiate the fare before getting into a taxi, especially if you're not using a metered taxi.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded buses or markets.\n- Consider purchasing a **tarjeta de transporte** (transport card) for convenient and discounted travel on public buses.\n- Download the **Moovit** app for helpful route planning and real-time information on public transportation in Bolivia.",
