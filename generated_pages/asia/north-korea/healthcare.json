  "content": "Healthcare in North Korea is a challenging and often limited system, with significant disparities in access to quality care between urban and rural areas, and a general lack of modern medical facilities and equipment.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 119\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in North Korea is theoretically universal, with all citizens entitled to free medical care. However, in reality, the system is plagued by shortages of medical supplies, equipment, and trained personnel, particularly in rural areas. The quality of care varies significantly depending on the location, with **Pyongyang**, the capital city, having the best-equipped and staffed hospitals. Rural areas, on the other hand, often have limited access to basic medical care, let alone specialized treatments. The system is also heavily reliant on traditional **Korean medicine**, which, while culturally significant, may not always provide the most effective treatment for modern diseases.\n\nThe public healthcare system in North Korea is the primary provider of medical care, with private healthcare options virtually non-existent. However, there are some specialized hospitals and clinics that cater to foreigners and high-ranking government officials, which may offer better quality care. Despite the theoretical universality of the system, many North Koreans, particularly those in rural areas, rely on **traditional healers** and **self-medication** due to the lack of access to modern medical care.\n\nThe urban-rural divide in healthcare access is a significant challenge in North Korea. While cities like **Pyongyang** and **Kaesong** have relatively well-equipped hospitals and a higher concentration of medical professionals, rural areas often have limited access to even basic medical care. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating health problems and contributing to higher mortality rates.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Okryu Hospital | Pyongyang | General | Surgery, Internal Medicine | Limited |\n| Pyongyang Medical University Hospital | Pyongyang | Teaching | Various | Limited |\n| Kim Man-yoo Hospital | Pyongyang | Specialized | Orthopedic, Neurosurgery | Limited |\n| Kaesong Hospital | Kaesong | General | Internal Medicine, Pediatrics | Limited |\n| Pyongyang Friendship Hospital | Pyongyang | Specialized | Foreigners, Diplomats | Moderate |\n| Red Cross Hospital | Pyongyang | General | Emergency, Trauma | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners and expats are recommended to have **international health insurance** that covers medical evacuation, as the local healthcare system may not be able to provide adequate care.\n- There are some local insurance options available, but they may not provide comprehensive coverage, especially for foreigners.\n- **Travel insurance** that includes medical coverage is also recommended for visitors to North Korea.\n- Expats and foreigners may be required to pay cash upfront for medical treatment, even if they have insurance.\n- Some employers may offer **private health insurance** as part of the employment package, but this is not common.\n- It is essential to research and understands the insurance options and requirements before traveling to or living in North Korea.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medication availability** is limited in North Korea, and many basic medications may not be available.\n- **Prescription requirements** are often lax, and medications may be dispensed without a prescription.\n- **Traditional Korean medicine** is widely available and often used in conjunction with modern medicine.\n- **Common brands** of medications may not be available, and generic or locally produced alternatives may be the only option.\n- **Costs** of medications can be high, especially for foreigners, and may need to be paid in cash.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **Typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to North Korea.\n- **Hepatitis B** and **Rabies** vaccinations may be recommended for certain individuals, such as healthcare workers or those who will be spending time in rural areas.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of North Korea, particularly in the summer months.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking tap water and use bottled or filtered water instead.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables.\n- **Air pollution** is a significant problem in urban areas, particularly in **Pyongyang**, and can exacerbate respiratory problems.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in North Korea, and the country is not a popular destination for medical travel.\n- However, some **specialized hospitals** in **Pyongyang** may offer certain medical procedures, such as **orthopedic surgery** or **plastic surgery**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are rare in North Korea, and travelers should exercise caution when seeking medical care.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for certain medical procedures, but the quality of care and equipment may be a concern.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a **medical emergency**, travelers should call the **emergency number** (119) or seek help from a local hospital or clinic.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is a concern, and travelers may need to rely on private transportation to reach a hospital.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may not have adequate equipment or staff to provide quality care, and medical evacuation may be necessary.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, and travelers should ensure they have adequate insurance coverage and understand the claims process before traveling to North Korea.\n- **Language barriers** can be a significant challenge in emergency situations, and travelers should try to find English-speaking medical staff or interpreters if possible.",
