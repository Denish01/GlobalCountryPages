[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
North Korea's healthcare system is primarily public, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and healthcare centers throughout the country. However, the quality of care in public facilities can be poor due to a lack of funding, outdated equipment, and a shortage of medical supplies. In contrast, private facilities, which are primarily used by high-ranking government officials and foreigners, offer better quality care but are often expensive and inaccessible to the general population. For locals, the healthcare system is generally free, but patients may be required to pay for certain medications or services. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical evacuation, as the quality of care in North Korea may not be up to international standards.

The healthcare system in North Korea is heavily controlled by the government, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and public health programs. However, the system is often plagued by corruption, with bribes and favors commonly exchanged for access to better care or priority treatment. Despite these challenges, North Korea has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. However, more work needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare quality and access between public and private facilities.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 119, or seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital or clinic. However, emergency services may be limited, particularly in rural areas, and may not be equipped to handle serious or complex medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for medical evacuation, as the quality of care in North Korea may not be up to international standards. The best hospitals for foreigners are typically located in Pyongyang, the capital city, and may have more comprehensive medical services and better-equipped facilities. However, even in these facilities, the quality of care may still be limited, and medical evacuation may be necessary in serious or complex cases.
