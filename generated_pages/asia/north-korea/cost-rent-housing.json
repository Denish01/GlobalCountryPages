The rental market is relatively small, and most apartments are state-owned and assigned to citizens based on their occupation, social status, and family size. Typical lease terms are usually long-term, and deposit requirements can be steep, often equivalent to several months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and evictions can occur without much notice. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as South Korea and China, North Korea's housing costs are relatively low, but the quality and availability of housing are also much lower.\n\nThe housing market in North Korea is also heavily influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a chronic shortage of housing and a lack of modern amenities. The government has been working to improve the housing stock, but progress has been slow, and many citizens still live in outdated and poorly maintained apartments. For foreigners, the housing options are limited, and they are often restricted to specific areas and buildings. The rent prices for foreigners are also typically higher than for locals, and they may be required to pay in foreign currency.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $200-$400 | $100-$250 | small, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $250-$500 | $150-$350 | simple furniture, shared bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$550 | family size, basic kitchen |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $400-$800 | spacious, modern amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,000-$2,000 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $500-$1,500 | residential areas, older buildings |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | limited amenities, traditional housing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Potonggang**: a central neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $200-$500 per month\n- **Mansudae**: a prestigious area with modern apartments, rent range $300-$700 per month\n- **Pyongchon**: a residential area with a mix of housing types, rent range $150-$400 per month\n- **Ryongseong**: a neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $200-$500 per month\n- **Sosong**: a central neighborhood with a mix of housing types, rent range $250-$600 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for North Korea [/SECTION]\n- Research and understand the local housing market and regulations before starting your search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or local contact to find suitable housing\n- Be prepared for limited amenities and outdated infrastructure in many buildings\n- **Negotiation** is key, and prices can often be lowered with persistence and patience\n- Be aware of **scams** and ensure that you are working with a legitimate agent or landlord\n- Utilities are often not included in the rent, and you may need to pay for electricity, water, and heating separately",
