        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>North Korea's economy is a centrally planned economy, with the government controlling most aspects of production and distribution. The country is classified as a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $480. The economy has been heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China, due to a lack of domestic resources and infrastructure. The development level of the economy is relatively low, with a focus on heavy industry and manufacturing. The trajectory of the economy has been marked by periods of stagnation and decline, particularly in the 1990s, due to a combination of factors including international sanctions, natural disasters, and a decline in Soviet aid.</p>
        <p>The economy is driven primarily by state-owned enterprises, with the government controlling key sectors such as coal mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. The private sector is relatively small, with most economic activity taking place in the informal sector. The government has implemented various economic reforms in recent years, including the introduction of special economic zones and the expansion of foreign trade. However, the economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and imports, and the international community has imposed various sanctions on the country due to concerns over its nuclear program.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges facing the economy, North Korea has made efforts to develop its infrastructure and promote economic growth. The government has invested in various projects, including the development of special economic zones and the expansion of the country's transportation network. However, the economy remains heavily isolated, and the lack of international engagement and investment has limited its potential for growth.</p>
