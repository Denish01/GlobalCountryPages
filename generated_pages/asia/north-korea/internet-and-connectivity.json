  "content": "The internet in North Korea is heavily restricted and limited, with only a select few having access to the global network, and tourists can purchase a SIM card from a local carrier to access the internet during their stay. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 1 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Poor\nMain Carriers: Koryolink, Kangsong, Byol\nSIM Card Cost: 50 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in North Korea is heavily restricted and controlled by the government, with only a limited number of citizens having access to the global network. The majority of the population can only access a heavily censored and restricted intranet, known as **Kwangmyong**, which provides limited information and services. In urban areas such as Pyongyang, the internet quality is slightly better, with some access to the global network available for high-ranking officials, foreigners, and select businesses. However, the internet speed is still very slow, and the reliability is poor, with frequent outages and disconnections.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is significant, with rural areas having little to no access to the internet or even basic telecommunications services. The government tightly controls the flow of information, and the internet is heavily censored, with many websites and services blocked. The reliability of the internet is also a major issue, with frequent power outages and infrastructure problems affecting the availability of services. Despite these challenges, there are some efforts to improve the internet infrastructure, including the introduction of new mobile networks and services.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTourists can purchase a SIM card from a local carrier, such as Koryolink or Byol, at the airport or in major cities. To purchase a SIM card, tourists will need to provide their passport and pay a fee of around 50 USD. The SIM card will usually come with a pre-paid plan, and tourists can top up their account with additional credit. The main carriers, Koryolink and Byol, offer a range of plans and services, including data and voice packages. However, the options are limited, and the prices can be high compared to other countries.\n\nIt's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, such as Koryolink, which offers a range of plans and services, including data and voice packages. Tourists should also be aware that the SIM card will only work within North Korea, and international roaming is not available. The data plans are usually limited, with speeds capped at around 1 Mbps, and the prices can be high, with around 10 USD per MB.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Koryolink | Pre-paid | 100 MB | 10 | Limited speed, no international roaming |\n| Byol | Tourist Plan | 500 MB | 50 | Limited speed, no international roaming |\n| Kangsong | Data Plan | 1 GB | 100 | Limited speed, no international roaming |\n| Pyol | Pre-paid | 50 MB | 5 | Limited speed, no international roaming |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is usually poor, with slow speeds and limited availability.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is non-existent, with few cafes offering WiFi services.\n- Coworking spaces are scarce, with only a few options available in major cities.\n- Public WiFi is not available, with the exception of a few select locations, such as airports and hotels.\n- Some foreign-owned hotels and restaurants may offer WiFi services, but these are usually limited and expensive.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are scarce, but some options are available in major cities, such as Pyongyang.\n- Reliable cafe chains are non-existent, but some foreign-owned restaurants may offer WiFi services.\n- Backup internet options are limited, with few alternatives available, such as mobile hotspots.\n- VPN needs are essential, as the government heavily censors the internet and blocks many websites and services.\n- Some hotels may offer business centers or meeting rooms with internet access, but these are usually expensive and limited.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is heavy, with many websites and services blocked, including social media and news sites.\n- Blocked sites include many popular services, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter.\n- VPN recommendations include using a reputable and secure VPN service to access blocked websites and services.\n- Roaming alternatives are limited, with few options available, such as purchasing a local SIM card or using a mobile hotspot.\n- eSIM options are not available, and tourists will need to purchase a physical SIM card to access the internet.\n- [CALLOUT] Be aware that the government monitors internet activity, and users should be cautious when accessing sensitive information or using VPN services.\n- [RATING] Internet quality: 2/5, with slow speeds and limited availability.",
