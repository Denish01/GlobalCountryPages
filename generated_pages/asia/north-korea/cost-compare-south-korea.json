North Korea's economy is largely isolated and centralized, with a focus on state-controlled industries, whereas South Korea has a highly developed, market-based economy with a strong focus on technology, manufacturing, and international trade. As a result, the cost of goods and services in North Korea is generally much lower, although the availability and quality of these items can be limited.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. North Korea's economy has been subject to international sanctions and trade restrictions, which have limited its access to foreign goods and services. In contrast, South Korea has a highly globalized economy with strong trade relationships with other countries, which has driven up the cost of living. Overall, North Korea is generally 70-80% cheaper than South Korea, although the quality and availability of goods and services can vary significantly.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | North Korea (USD) | South Korea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $100 | $800 | 87.5% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $50 | $500 | 90% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $1,500 | 86.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | North Korea (USD) | South Korea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $15 | 66.7% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $50 | $200 | 75% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1 | $3 | 66.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | North Korea (USD) | South Korea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $10 | $50 | 80% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $2 | 75% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50 | $1.50 | 66.7% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | North Korea (USD) | South Korea (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $20 | $100 | 80% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $10 | $50 | 80% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $5 | $20 | 75% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | North Korea (USD) | South Korea (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $200 | $1,000 | 80% |\n| Mid-Range | $500 | $2,500 | 80% |\n| Comfortable | $1,000 | $5,000 | 80% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **North Korea is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing\n- Food and dining\n- Transportation\n- Utilities and internet\n- **South Korea is cheaper for:**\n- Access to high-quality goods and services\n- International travel and connectivity\n- Modern amenities and infrastructure\n- Entertainment and leisure activities\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, North Korea may offer a unique and affordable experience, although the limited availability of goods and services can be a challenge.
