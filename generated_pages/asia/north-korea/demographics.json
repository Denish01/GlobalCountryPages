  "content": "The population of North Korea is approximately 26.1 million people, with a relatively homogeneous ethnic and linguistic profile, but with notable variations in terms of age distribution, urbanization, and access to resources.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 26.1 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.5%\nMedian Age: 34.6 years\nUrban Population: 60.9%\nPopulation Density: 217 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 71.7 years\nFertility Rate: 1.9 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nNorth Korea's population size is significant in the context of its relatively small land area, resulting in a high population density. The country's population growth rate has been steadily decreasing over the past few decades, with a current rate of 0.5% per annum. This decline is largely due to a combination of factors, including a low fertility rate and limited access to healthcare and education. Urbanization is a notable trend in North Korea, with approximately 60.9% of the population residing in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Pyongyang and other major cities such as Kaesong and Sinuiju. However, migration patterns are heavily restricted, both within the country and across its borders, due to the government's strict control over the movement of its citizens.\n\nThe population of North Korea is also characterized by a significant dependency ratio, with a relatively large proportion of young people and a rapidly aging population. This demographic shift poses significant challenges for the country's economy and social services, particularly in terms of providing adequate healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. Furthermore, the limited access to resources, including food, water, and energy, exacerbates the demographic challenges faced by the country. The government's response to these challenges has been limited, and the country remains heavily reliant on international aid and support.\n\nDespite these challenges, North Korea's population remains a vital component of the country's economy and society. The government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting economic development and improving living standards, including initiatives to increase food production, expand access to education and healthcare, and promote foreign investment. However, the effectiveness of these policies has been limited, and the country's population continues to face significant development challenges.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Korean | 99.9% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Chinese | 0.1% | Pyongyang, border regions | Small but significant minority |\n| Japanese | negligible | Pyongyang, border regions | Legacy of colonial era |\n| Russian | negligible | Pyongyang, border regions | Small community of expatriates |\n| Other | negligible | Nationwide | Includes small groups of Europeans, Americans, and other nationalities |\n[/TABLE]\nNorth Korea's ethnic landscape is characterized by a dominant Korean population, with a small but significant minority of Chinese nationals residing primarily in the capital city and border regions. The country's ethnic relations are generally homogeneous, with a strong emphasis on national identity and unity. However, there are some tensions between the Korean majority and the Chinese minority, particularly in terms of access to resources and economic opportunities.\n\n[SECTION] Languages [/SECTION]\n- **Korean** is the official language, spoken by the vast majority of the population\n- Regional dialects, such as the Pyongyang dialect, are also widely spoken\n- **Chinese** is spoken by the Chinese minority, particularly in border regions\n- English is becoming increasingly popular as a second language, particularly among younger people and those involved in international trade and diplomacy\n- Other languages, including Russian and Japanese, are spoken by small groups of expatriates and diplomats\n\n[SECTION] Religions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Religion | Percentage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Atheism | 64% | Official state policy, although many people practice traditional folk religions |\n| Shamanism | 16% | Traditional folk religion, often practiced in conjunction with other beliefs |\n| Buddhism | 13% | Small but significant minority, with a long history in the country |\n| Christianity | 4% | Small but growing minority, despite official restrictions |\n| Other | 3% | Includes small groups of Muslims, Hindus, and other faiths |\n[/TABLE]\nReligious freedom is limited in North Korea, with the government promoting a policy of **Juche**, or self-reliance, which emphasizes the importance of national unity and loyalty to the state. While many people practice traditional folk religions, including shamanism and Buddhism, the government's official policy is one of atheism. However, there is a growing Christian minority, despite official restrictions and persecution. Interfaith relations are generally tense, with the government viewing religious activity as a potential threat to its authority.\n\n[SECTION] Age Distribution [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Age Group | Percentage | Implications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-14 | 21.4% | Significant youth population, with implications for education and healthcare |\n| 15-24 | 15.6% | Young adult population, with implications for employment and economic development |\n| 25-54 | 54.4% | Working-age population, with implications for economic productivity and taxation |\n| 55-64 | 6.3% | Aging population, with implications for healthcare and social services |\n| 65+ | 2.3% | Elderly population, with implications for pension and social security systems |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Urbanization & Major Cities [/SECTION]\n- The urban population is approximately 60.9%, with the majority residing in the capital city of **Pyongyang**\n- Other major cities include **Kaesong**, **Sinuiju**, and **Chongjin**, which are significant centers of industry, commerce, and culture\n- The fastest-growing cities are those located in the western coastal region, which are experiencing significant economic development and investment\n- Migration patterns are heavily restricted, with the government controlling the movement of people between cities and regions\n- The North Korean diaspora is significant, with many people residing in countries such as **China**, **South Korea**, and **Japan**, often in search of better economic opportunities or to escape persecution.",
