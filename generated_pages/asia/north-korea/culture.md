[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
North Korea's culture is defined by its unique blend of traditional Korean heritage and socialist ideology. The country's cultural identity is deeply rooted in its history, with a strong emphasis on **Juche**, or self-reliance, which has been the guiding principle of the nation since its founding. The Korean language is the primary language spoken, and the population is predominantly ethnically Korean. The country's cultural landscape has been shaped by its geographic location, with influences from China and Russia, as well as its historical experiences, including the Japanese occupation and the Korean War.

The North Korean government plays a significant role in shaping the country's cultural identity, with a strong emphasis on promoting a sense of national pride and loyalty to the state. The government supports a wide range of cultural institutions, including museums, theaters, and music schools, which help to promote traditional Korean arts and culture. The country's cultural identity is also reflected in its architecture, with a mix of traditional Korean styles and modern socialist-era buildings. The capital city, Pyongyang, is a showcase for the country's cultural achievements, with its grand monuments, museums, and performance venues.

Despite its isolation from the rest of the world, North Korea's culture has been influenced by external factors, including the introduction of foreign technologies and ideas.
