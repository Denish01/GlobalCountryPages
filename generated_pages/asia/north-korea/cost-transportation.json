However, the quality of public transit can vary greatly depending on the location, with rural areas often having limited options. Most people in North Korea get around on foot, by bicycle, or using public transportation, as owning a private vehicle is a luxury few can afford. The government also operates a network of buses and trams that connect major cities, but these services can be slow and unreliable.\n\nThe main transportation modes in North Korea are buses, trams, and trains, with buses being the most popular mode of public transportation. The quality of public transit is generally good in major cities, with modern buses and trams operating on fixed routes. However, in rural areas, public transportation is often limited, and people may have to rely on walking or cycling to get around. The government has also invested in developing the country's rail network, with trains connecting major cities and towns.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.10-$0.20 | $5-$10 | Good coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.10-$0.20 | $5-$10 | Available in Pyongyang only |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Limited routes, often overcrowded |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$5.00 | $10-$20 | Limited availability, often slow |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5.00-$10.00 | $1.00-$2.00 | $10.00-$20.00 | Limited availability, often old vehicles |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available due to international sanctions |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20.00-$50.00 | Limited options, often expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50-$2.50 | Limited availability, often rationed |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00-$2.00 | Limited availability, often rationed |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $50.00-$100.00 | Limited options, often expensive |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Limited availability, often free |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable, limited road network |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10.00-$20.00 | Limited availability, often slow |\n| Domestic Flight | $50.00-$100.00 | Limited availability, often expensive |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20.00-$50.00 | Limited availability, often slow |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or trams, which are relatively affordable and widely available.\n- When taking a taxi, it's a good idea to negotiate the fare in advance, as meters are often not used.\n- Be aware that traffic rules are often not strictly enforced, and road conditions can be poor, so it's essential to exercise caution when walking or driving.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass, which can be a cost-effective option for frequent travelers.\n- When traveling to rural areas, be prepared for limited transportation options and plan ahead to avoid getting stranded.\n- It's also a good idea to learn some basic **Korean phrases**, such as \"where is the bus station?\" or \"how much does it cost?\", to help you navigate the transportation system.",
