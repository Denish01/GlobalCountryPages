  "content": "The cost of healthcare in North Korea is relatively low compared to other countries, but the quality of care can vary greatly between public and private facilities, with public facilities often being underfunded and understaffed.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $253 (based on World Bank data)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 68% (based on World Bank data)\nHealthcare System: Public\nEmergency Number: 119\nInsurance Required: No\nCurrency: KPW\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nNorth Korea's healthcare system is primarily public, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and healthcare centers throughout the country. However, the quality of care in public facilities can be poor due to a lack of funding, outdated equipment, and a shortage of medical supplies. In contrast, private facilities, which are primarily used by high-ranking government officials and foreigners, offer better quality care but are often expensive and inaccessible to the general population. For locals, the healthcare system is generally free, but patients may be required to pay for certain medications or services. For foreigners, it is recommended to have insurance that covers medical evacuation, as the quality of care in North Korea may not be up to international standards.\n\nThe healthcare system in North Korea is heavily controlled by the government, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and public health programs. However, the system is often plagued by corruption, with bribes and favors commonly exchanged for access to better care or priority treatment. Despite these challenges, North Korea has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. However, more work needs to be done to address the significant disparities in healthcare quality and access between public and private facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public facilities may have long wait times and limited availability of doctors |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private facilities may have more experienced specialists, but at a higher cost |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Dental care is relatively limited in North Korea, with few specialized dentists |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$30 | Eye care is also limited, with few optometrists or ophthalmologists |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Laboratory facilities may be limited, with long wait times for test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public facilities may have limited emergency services, with long wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $10-$20 | Private facilities may have more comfortable accommodations, but at a higher cost |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Surgical services may be limited, with few specialized surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $50-$100 | Maternity care is relatively limited, with few specialized obstetricians |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Diagnostic imaging services may be limited, with few MRI or CT scanners |\n| X-Ray | $10-$20 | X-ray services are more widely available, but may still be limited in rural areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays, but may not include specialized care or medications |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers more comprehensive medical services, including specialized care and medications, but may be expensive and inaccessible to many |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Covers medical evacuation and repatriation, as well as comprehensive medical services, but may be expensive and require a high deductible |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers may be available at a relatively low cost, around $5-$10 per prescription\n- Prescription medications may be limited, with few international brands available\n- Pharmacy availability may be limited, particularly in rural areas\n- Over-the-counter medications may be available, but may be of questionable quality\n- Medication prices may vary depending on the location and availability of the medication\n- Some medications may be in short supply, particularly during times of economic sanctions or trade embargoes\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 119, or seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital or clinic. However, emergency services may be limited, particularly in rural areas, and may not be equipped to handle serious or complex medical emergencies. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a plan in place for medical evacuation, as the quality of care in North Korea may not be up to international standards. The best hospitals for foreigners are typically located in Pyongyang, the capital city, and may have more comprehensive medical services and better-equipped facilities. However, even in these facilities, the quality of care may still be limited, and medical evacuation may be necessary in serious or complex cases.",
