[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in North Korea are generally higher than the regional average due to the country's limited agricultural production, lack of infrastructure, and strict trade restrictions. The prices of basic staples like rice, potatoes, and vegetables can fluctuate depending on the season and availability, with prices tend to be higher in urban areas like Pyongyang. The eating-out culture is not as prevalent in North Korea as it is in other countries, and home cooking is the norm, with many families relying on their own gardens or **jangmadang** (black markets) to supplement their food supplies.

The prices of food in North Korea are also driven up by the country's **subsistence economy**, where many people rely on their own production to survive. The government's **public distribution system**, which provides a limited amount of food and other essentials to citizens, can also impact food prices. However, the system is often unreliable, and many people are forced to rely on alternative sources, including **black markets** and **informal trade**. As a result, food prices in North Korea can be highly variable and dependent on a range of factors, including location, season, and availability.
