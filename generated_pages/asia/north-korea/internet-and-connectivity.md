[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in North Korea is heavily restricted and controlled by the government, with only a limited number of citizens having access to the global network. The majority of the population can only access a heavily censored and restricted intranet, known as **Kwangmyong**, which provides limited information and services. In urban areas such as Pyongyang, the internet quality is slightly better, with some access to the global network available for high-ranking officials, foreigners, and select businesses. However, the internet speed is still very slow, and the reliability is poor, with frequent outages and disconnections.

The urban-rural divide is significant, with rural areas having little to no access to the internet or even basic telecommunications services. The government tightly controls the flow of information, and the internet is heavily censored, with many websites and services blocked. The reliability of the internet is also a major issue, with frequent power outages and infrastructure problems affecting the availability of services. Despite these challenges, there are some efforts to improve the internet infrastructure, including the introduction of new mobile networks and services.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Tourists can purchase a SIM card from a local carrier, such as Koryolink or Byol, at the airport or in major cities. To purchase a SIM card, tourists will need to provide their passport and pay a fee of around 50 USD. The SIM card will usually come with a pre-paid plan, and tourists can top up their account with additional credit. The main carriers, Koryolink and Byol, offer a range of plans and services, including data and voice packages. However, the options are limited, and the prices can be high compared to other countries.

It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, such as Koryolink, which offers a range of plans and services, including data and voice packages. Tourists should also be aware that the SIM card will only work within North Korea, and international roaming is not available. The data plans are usually limited, with speeds capped at around 1 Mbps, and the prices can be high, with around 10 USD per MB.
