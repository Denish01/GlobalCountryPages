[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
North Korea has a relatively well-developed public transportation system, with buses, trams, and metros available in major cities like Pyongyang. However, the quality of public transit can vary greatly depending on the location, with rural areas often having limited options. Most people in North Korea get around on foot, by bicycle, or using public transportation, as owning a private vehicle is a luxury few can afford. The government also operates a network of buses and trams that connect major cities, but these services can be slow and unreliable.

The main transportation modes in North Korea are buses, trams, and trains, with buses being the most popular mode of public transportation. The quality of public transit is generally good in major cities, with modern buses and trams operating on fixed routes. However, in rural areas, public transportation is often limited, and people may have to rely on walking or cycling to get around. The government has also invested in developing the country's rail network, with trains connecting major cities and towns.
