The costs of utilities in North Korea can fluctuate greatly depending on the season, with winter months often seeing higher costs due to increased demand for heating. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities remains relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe quality of utility services in North Korea varies greatly depending on the location, with cities like Pyongyang generally having better access to reliable utilities than rural areas.
