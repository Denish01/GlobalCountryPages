[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in North Korea is the Pyongyang Sunan International Airport (FNJ), which receives flights from a limited number of destinations, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Vladivostok. There are no direct flights from Western countries, so travelers typically need to transfer in China or Russia. The airport is located about 24 kilometers northwest of Pyongyang's city center. Overland entry points are also available, including the border crossing with China at Sinuiju and the border crossing with Russia at Rason. However, these entry points are subject to strict regulations and require special permits.

Travelers can also enter North Korea by train from China, with the most common route being from Beijing to Pyongyang. This journey takes around 24 hours and passes through the Chinese city of Dandong before crossing the border into North Korea. There are also limited bus services available from China, but these are not commonly used by tourists. It's worth noting that all travelers to North Korea must be accompanied by a guided tour group, which can be arranged through a licensed tour operator.
