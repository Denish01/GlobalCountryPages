# North Korea Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in North Korea is underdeveloped and often unreliable, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, particularly in terms of access to **electricity**, **clean water**, and **modern transportation**.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 26% of population
Internet Penetration: 0.1%
Road Network: 25,554 km, mostly unpaved and poorly maintained
Rail Network: 7,435 km
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 5
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
North Korea's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with many of its systems and facilities in need of significant repair and modernization. Recent investments have been made in select areas, such as the renovation of major highways and the expansion of the rail network, but much work remains to be done. The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is particularly pronounced, with cities like **Pyongyang** enjoying relatively better access to basic services like electricity and clean water, while rural areas often struggle with limited or non-existent access to these essentials.

The government has made efforts to improve the country's infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on showcasing its development achievements to the international community. However, these efforts have been hindered by **international sanctions** and a lack of foreign investment, which have limited the country's ability to secure the resources and expertise needed to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects. As a result, many of North Korea's infrastructure systems remain in a state of disrepair, with frequent **power outages** and **transportation disruptions** a common occurrence.

Despite these challenges, North Korea has made some progress in developing its infrastructure in recent years, particularly in the areas of **information technology** and **renewable energy**. The country has invested in the development of its **fiber optic network**, and has also made efforts to promote the use of **solar** and **wind power** as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. However, much work remains to be done to bring the country's infrastructure up to modern standards, and to address the significant disparities in access to basic services that exist between urban and rural areas.
