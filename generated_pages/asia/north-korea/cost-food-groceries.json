  "content": "Food prices in North Korea can be challenging to determine due to the country's isolated economy and limited access to information, but approximate costs can be estimated based on available data and reports from visitors.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($5-10 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($20-50 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($50-100 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($2-5 USD)\nCurrency: KPW\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nFood prices in North Korea are generally higher than the regional average due to the country's limited agricultural production, lack of infrastructure, and strict trade restrictions. The prices of basic staples like rice, potatoes, and vegetables can fluctuate depending on the season and availability, with prices tend to be higher in urban areas like Pyongyang. The eating-out culture is not as prevalent in North Korea as it is in other countries, and home cooking is the norm, with many families relying on their own gardens or **jangmadang** (black markets) to supplement their food supplies.\n\nThe prices of food in North Korea are also driven up by the country's **subsistence economy**, where many people rely on their own production to survive. The government's **public distribution system**, which provides a limited amount of food and other essentials to citizens, can also impact food prices. However, the system is often unreliable, and many people are forced to rely on alternative sources, including **black markets** and **informal trade**. As a result, food prices in North Korea can be highly variable and dependent on a range of factors, including location, season, and availability.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2-3 | 2,500-3,500 KPW | Limited availability |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1-2 | 1,000-2,000 KPW | Often sold in **jangmadang** |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2-3 | 2,000-3,000 KPW | Can be expensive in urban areas |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1-2 | 1,000-2,000 KPW | Staple food, prices vary by region |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $5-10 | 5,000-10,000 KPW | Limited availability, often imported |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10-20 | 10,000-20,000 KPW | Luxury item, often reserved for special occasions |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3-5 | 3,000-5,000 KPW | Seasonal, prices vary by quality |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2-3 | 2,000-3,000 KPW | Limited availability, often sold in **jangmadang** |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1-2 | 1,000-2,000 KPW | Staple food, prices vary by region |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1-2 | 1,000-2,000 KPW | Basic ingredient, widely available |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5-10 | 5,000-10,000 KPW | Limited availability, often homemade |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 | 1,000-2,000 KPW | Widely available, prices vary by brand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 | Limited options, often **naengmyeon** (cold noodles) or **mandu** (dumplings) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-20 | Basic meals, often **bibimbap** (mixed rice bowl) or **jjajangmyeon** (noodles with black bean sauce) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-50 | 3 courses, often **bulgogi** (grilled meat) or **jjim** (steamed dish) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-100 | Upscale, often **hanjeongsik** (traditional Korean cuisine) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-5 | Limited availability, often **Taedonggang** beer |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-10 | Luxury item, often reserved for special occasions |\n| Cappuccino | $5-10 | Limited availability, often in upscale cafes |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-5 | Widely available, prices vary by brand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nIn North Korea, there are limited **supermarkets** and **department stores**, and most people rely on **local markets** or **jangmadang** to buy their daily essentials.
