  "content": "To get around in North Korea, travelers can use a combination of domestic flights, trains, buses, and city transport options, although the availability and quality of these services can vary greatly depending on the region and time of year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Pyongyang Sunan International Airport (FNJ)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: extensive\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: none\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe main international airport in North Korea is the Pyongyang Sunan International Airport (FNJ), which receives flights from a limited number of destinations, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Vladivostok. There are no direct flights from Western countries, so travelers typically need to transfer in China or Russia. The airport is located about 24 kilometers northwest of Pyongyang's city center. Overland entry points are also available, including the border crossing with China at Sinuiju and the border crossing with Russia at Rason. However, these entry points are subject to strict regulations and require special permits.\n\nTravelers can also enter North Korea by train from China, with the most common route being from Beijing to Pyongyang. This journey takes around 24 hours and passes through the Chinese city of Dandong before crossing the border into North Korea. There are also limited bus services available from China, but these are not commonly used by tourists. It's worth noting that all travelers to North Korea must be accompanied by a guided tour group, which can be arranged through a licensed tour operator.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nDomestic flights in North Korea are limited, with most routes operating out of Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. The main domestic airline is **Air Koryo**, which offers flights to a handful of destinations, including Hamhung, Chongjin, and Mount Myohyang. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, as the airline's website is not always available in English and payment options are limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $300 USD, depending on the route and class of service. Travelers should be prepared for delays and cancellations, as the airline's schedule is not always reliable.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nNorth Korea has an extensive rail network, with trains connecting most major cities. The main rail line runs from Pyongyang to Sinuiju on the Chinese border, with branches to other cities like Hamhung and Wonsan.
