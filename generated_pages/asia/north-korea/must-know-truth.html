        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>North Korea, officially known as the <strong>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)</strong>, has a complex and tumultuous history. The Korean Peninsula was first inhabited around 10,000 years ago, with various tribes and kingdoms rising and falling over the centuries. In 1910, Korea was <strong>annexed by Japan</strong>, and it remained under Japanese rule until the end of World War II in 1945. After Japan's defeat, the Korean Peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the United States controlling the south. In 1948, separate governments were established in each half, with the DPRK being proclaimed in the north on September 9, 1948.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Korean War (1950-1953)</strong> was fought between North Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea, supported by the United States and other members of the United Nations. The war ended with the signing of the <strong>Armistice Agreement</strong> on July 27, 1953, but a formal peace treaty was never signed. Since then, the two Koreas have remained technically at war, with the <strong>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)</strong> serving as a buffer between them. The DPRK has been ruled by the <strong>Kim dynasty</strong> since its founding, with Kim Il-sung serving as the first leader, followed by his son Kim Jong-il, and now his grandson Kim Jong-un.</p>
        <p>The DPRK has been classified as a <strong>socialist state</strong> and a <strong>one-party state</strong>, with the <strong>Workers' Party of Korea</strong> being the only party allowed to govern. The country has a <strong>command economy</strong>, with the government controlling the means of production and distribution of goods and services. The DPRK has also been known for its <strong>isolationist policies</strong>, with limited diplomatic and economic relations with other countries.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the DPRK has made efforts to develop its <strong>nuclear program</strong>, which has led to increased tensions with other countries, particularly the United States and South Korea. The country has also been subject to <strong>international sanctions</strong> due to its nuclear and missile tests, as well as its human rights record. Despite these challenges, the DPRK continues to maintain its independence and sovereignty, with a strong emphasis on <strong>self-reliance</strong> and <strong>national pride</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "North Korea is completely closed off to the world"</p>
        <p>Reality: While the DPRK is certainly isolated, it is not completely closed off to the world. The country has diplomatic relations with over 160 countries and allows a limited number of tourists to visit each year. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "All North Koreans are brainwashed and loyal to the government"</p>
        <p>Reality: While the DPRK government does exercise significant control over the population, there are many North Koreans who are aware of the outside world and may not be entirely loyal to the government. Defectors and refugees have reported a range of opinions and attitudes among the population. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "North Korea is a barren and poverty-stricken country"</p>
        <p>Reality: While the DPRK does face significant economic challenges, it is not entirely barren and poverty-stricken. The country has a range of natural resources, including coal, iron ore, and rare earth minerals, and has made efforts to develop its infrastructure and economy. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "North Korea is a military dictatorship with no culture or arts"</p>
        <p>Reality: The DPRK has a rich cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on traditional music, dance, and art. The country also has a significant number of museums, theaters, and cultural institutions, and hosts a range of festivals and events throughout the year. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "North Korea is a major threat to global security"</p>
        <p>Reality: While the DPRK's nuclear program is certainly a concern, the country's military capabilities are not as significant as those of other major powers. The country's primary focus is on self-defense and maintaining its sovereignty, rather than expanding its territory or threatening other countries. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "North Korea has no economic relationships with other countries"</p>
        <p>Reality: The DPRK has significant trade relationships with countries such as China, Russia, and India, and has also established economic partnerships with other countries in the region. The country is also a member of the <strong>United Nations</strong> and participates in a range of international economic organizations. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <h2>Challenges & Context</h2>

        <li>The DPRK has a <strong>limited energy sector</strong>, with a reliance on coal and a lack of access to modern energy technologies.</li>
        <li>The country also faces significant <strong>food security challenges</strong>, with a lack of arable land, limited access to fertilizers and other agricultural inputs, and a vulnerability to natural disasters.</li>
        <li>The DPRK has a <strong>high level of military spending</strong>, with a significant proportion of its budget dedicated to defense and security.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Gets Overlooked</h2>

        <li>The country has a <strong>significant number of natural resources</strong>, including coal, iron ore, and rare earth minerals.</li>
