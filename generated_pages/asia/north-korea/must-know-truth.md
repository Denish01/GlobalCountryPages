# The Truth About North Korea - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
North Korea, officially known as the **Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)**, has a complex and tumultuous history. The Korean Peninsula was first inhabited around 10,000 years ago, with various tribes and kingdoms rising and falling over the centuries. In 1910, Korea was **annexed by Japan**, and it remained under Japanese rule until the end of World War II in 1945. After Japan's defeat, the Korean Peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the United States controlling the south. In 1948, separate governments were established in each half, with the DPRK being proclaimed in the north on September 9, 1948.

The **Korean War (1950-1953)** was fought between North Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea, supported by the United States and other members of the United Nations. The war ended with the signing of the **Armistice Agreement** on July 27, 1953, but a formal peace treaty was never signed. Since then, the two Koreas have remained technically at war, with the **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** serving as a buffer between them. The DPRK has been ruled by the **Kim dynasty** since its founding, with Kim Il-sung serving as the first leader, followed by his son Kim Jong-il, and now his grandson Kim Jong-un.

The DPRK has been classified as a **socialist state** and a **one-party state**, with the **Workers' Party of Korea** being the only party allowed to govern. The country has a **command economy**, with the government controlling the means of production and distribution of goods and services. The DPRK has also been known for its **isolationist policies**, with limited diplomatic and economic relations with other countries.

In recent years, the DPRK has made efforts to develop its **nuclear program**, which has led to increased tensions with other countries, particularly the United States and South Korea. The country has also been subject to **international sanctions** due to its nuclear and missile tests, as well as its human rights record. Despite these challenges, the DPRK continues to maintain its independence and sovereignty, with a strong emphasis on **self-reliance** and **national pride**.
