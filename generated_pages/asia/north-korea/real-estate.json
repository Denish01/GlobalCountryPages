The market is largely driven by state-owned enterprises and government agencies, with private ownership and foreign investment severely restricted. The price trajectory of properties in North Korea has been relatively stable, with minor fluctuations due to the country's isolated economy. Urban areas, such as Pyongyang, tend to have higher property prices compared to rural areas, where the cost of living is significantly lower. However, the overall property market remains underdeveloped, with limited infrastructure and amenities.\n\nThe North Korean government has implemented various measures to control the property market, including strict regulations on property ownership and transfer. The government also exercises significant control over the allocation of land and resources, which can limit the availability of properties for sale or rent. Despite these challenges, there are some opportunities for investment in the property market, particularly in areas with strategic importance, such as special economic zones.\n\nThe property market in North Korea is also influenced by the country's unique economic system, which is based on a combination of state-owned enterprises, collective farms, and small-scale private businesses. The government plays a significant role in allocating resources and controlling the flow of goods and services, which can impact the demand for properties and the overall market trends.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pyongyang | 1,500 | 50 | Apartment |\n| Kaesong | 1,000 | 30 | House |\n| Sinuiju | 800 | 20 | Apartment |\n| Hamhung | 600 | 15 | House |\n| Chongjin | 500 | 10 | Apartment |\n| Wonsan | 400 | 8 | House |\n| Nampo | 300 | 5 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are not allowed to own property in North Korea, with the exception of certain special economic zones, where foreign investment is permitted under specific conditions.\n- Foreign companies can establish a presence in North Korea through a joint venture with a local partner, which can provide access to the property market.\n- Leasehold arrangements are possible, but are subject to strict regulations and require government approval.\n- Foreigners must obtain a permit from the relevant authorities to rent or lease a property in North Korea.\n- Foreign investment in the property market is subject to strict controls and requires approval from the State Development Bank and other government agencies.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
