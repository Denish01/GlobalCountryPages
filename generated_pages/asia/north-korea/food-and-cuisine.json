The country's culinary scene is characterized by a reliance on **jeyuk bokkeum** (stir-fried pork) and **mandu** (Korean dumplings), which are often served at special occasions and everyday meals alike. Regional variations are also present, with the northern regions favoring **dog meat soup** and the southern regions preferring **raw fish dishes**. The food culture in North Korea is also shaped by the country's history and politics, with many dishes named after important events and figures, such as **Pyongyang Naengmyeon**, a cold noodle dish named after the capital city.\n\nThe country's cuisine is also known for its use of **gochujang** (Korean chili paste) and **doenjang** (Korean fermented soybean paste), which add depth and spice to many dishes. Despite the limited availability of certain ingredients, North Korean cuisine has developed a unique flavor profile that is both familiar and distinct from other Korean cuisines. The government also plays a significant role in shaping the country's food culture, with many state-run restaurants and food establishments serving traditional dishes.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in **fusion cuisine**, with some restaurants incorporating international flavors and ingredients into traditional North Korean dishes. However, this trend is largely limited to upscale restaurants in major cities, and traditional cuisine remains the dominant force in the country's culinary scene.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Naengmyeon | Noodle dish | Cold buckwheat or starch noodles with spicy sauce, sliced cucumbers, and pear slices | Pyongyang restaurants |\n| Bulgogi | Meat dish | Grilled marinated beef, often served with a side of kimchi and rice | High-end restaurants |\n| Jeyuk bokkeum | Stir-fry | Stir-fried pork with vegetables and gochujang, served with steamed rice | Local eateries |\n| Mandu | Dumpling | Korean-style dumplings filled with meat or kimchi, steamed or fried | Street food stalls |\n| Kimchi stew | Stew | Spicy stew made with kimchi, pork, and tofu, served with steamed rice | Traditional restaurants |\n| Dog meat soup | Soup | Hearty soup made with dog meat, vegetables, and gochujang, served with steamed rice | Northern region restaurants |\n| Raw fish dish | Raw dish | Fresh raw fish sliced into thin pieces, served with a spicy sauce and steamed rice | Southern region restaurants |\n| Pyongyang cold noodles | Noodle dish | Cold noodles made from buckwheat or starch, served with a spicy sauce and sliced cucumbers | Pyongyang restaurants |\n| Bibimbap | Rice bowl | Mixed rice bowl dish topped with an assortment of vegetables, meat, and a fried egg | Upscale restaurants |\n| Japchae | Noodle dish | Stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables and sometimes meat, served with steamed rice | Local eateries |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Tteokbokki**: spicy rice cakes cooked in a sweet and spicy sauce, $1-2 USD\n- **Hotteok**: sweet pancakes filled with honey and cinnamon, $0.50-1 USD\n- **Mandu**: Korean-style dumplings filled with meat or kimchi, steamed or fried, $1-2 USD\n- **Bungeo-ppang**: fish-shaped pastry filled with sweet red bean paste, $0.50-1 USD\n- **Kimbap**: Korean-style sushi rolls filled with vegetables and sometimes meat, $1-2 USD\n- **Odeng**: fish cake skewers, $1-2 USD\n- **Beondegi**: silkworm pupae, often served as a snack, $1-2 USD\n- **Bulgogi burger**: a fusion dish featuring a beef patty topped with bulgogi sauce and kimchi, $2-3 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Taedonggang beer**: a local beer brewed in Pyongyang, $2-3 USD\n- **Soju**: a clear spirit made from grain or potato, often consumed with beer, $2-3 USD\n- **Makgeolli**: a traditional Korean rice wine, $2-3 USD\n- **Korean tea**: a variety of teas made from herbs and plants, $1-2 USD\n- **Coffee**: a growing trend in North Korea, with some cafes serving coffee made from locally sourced beans, $2-3 USD\n- **Fresh juice**: a variety of juices made from locally sourced fruits, $1-2 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Table manners: wait for the host to start eating before beginning your meal\n- Chopstick etiquette: never leave your chopsticks standing upright in your rice bowl, as this is reminiscent of a funeral ritual\n- Tipping: not expected, but sometimes accepted in upscale restaurants\n- Dress code: modest clothing is recommended, with no revealing or provocative attire\n- Reservation culture: reservations are often required for high-end restaurants, but not necessary for local eateries\n- Eating with locals: be prepared to share food and drinks with your hosts, as this is a sign of respect and friendship\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **State-run restaurants**: upscale establishments serving traditional North Korean cuisine\n- **Local eateries**: casual restaurants serving a variety of dishes, including stir-fries and noodle dishes\n- **Street food stalls**: vendors selling a range of snacks and dishes, from tteokbokki to kimbap\n- **Markets**: traditional markets selling fresh produce, meats, and spices, with some vendors offering prepared dishes\n- **Food courts**: modern establishments offering a range of cuisines, including international options\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Pyongyang Central Market**: a large market selling fresh produce, meats, and spices, with some vendors offering prepared dishes\n- **Tongil Market**: a traditional market selling a range of goods, including food and handicrafts\n- **Ryongwang Food Street**: a street lined with restaurants and food stalls, offering a variety of dishes and snacks\n- **Kaesong Folk Custom Hotel**: a hotel offering traditional Korean cuisine and cultural experiences, including cooking classes and tea ceremonies\n- **Pyongyang Cooking Class**: a cooking class where participants can learn to make traditional North Korean dishes, such as naengmyeon and bulgogi",
