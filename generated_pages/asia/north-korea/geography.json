The country is surrounded by the Yellow Sea to the west, the Korea Strait to the south, and the Sea of Japan to the east. The Korean Peninsula is a strategic location, with the Korean Strait connecting the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan, and the peninsula itself forming a natural barrier between the Asian continent and the Japanese archipelago.\n\nThe country's borders with its neighbors are a significant aspect of its geography. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with South Korea is one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world, while the border with China is largely mountainous and remote. The border with Russia is short, but it provides North Korea with access to the Sea of Japan and the Russian port city of Vladivostok. The country's coastline is approximately 2,495 kilometers long, with many bays, inlets, and islands that provide natural harbors and fishing grounds.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nNorth Korea's terrain is dominated by mountains, with over 80% of the country's land area consisting of mountains and hills. The **Taebaek Mountains** run along the eastern coast, while the **Kangnam Mountains** and the **Myohyang Mountains** are located in the central and western parts of the country. The highest point in North Korea is **Paektu Mountain**, an active volcano that is considered sacred by the North Korean people. The country's mountains are densely forested, with many species of trees, including pine, oak, and maple.\n\nThe country's landscape is also characterized by numerous rivers, including the **Amnok River**, which forms part of the border with China, and the **Taedong River**, which flows through the capital city of Pyongyang. The **Imjin River** and the **Han River** are also significant, as they form part of the border with South Korea. The coastal plains are narrow and fertile, with many agricultural areas and fishing villages. The western coastal plain is the most densely populated region, with many cities and towns, including the port city of Nampo.\n\nNorth Korea's terrain and landscape have played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture. The mountains have provided natural barriers against invaders, while the rivers have facilitated trade and communication. The country's natural resources, including coal, iron, and copper, have also been an important factor in its economic development.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 10-20°C | moderate | mild, with some rain |\n| Summer | June to August | 20-30°C | heavy | hot and humid, with occasional typhoons |\n| Autumn | September to November | 10-20°C | moderate | cool, with some rain |\n| Winter | December to February | -10 to 0°C | light | cold, with some snow |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to November.
