  "content": "The infrastructure in North Korea is underdeveloped and often unreliable, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, particularly in terms of access to **electricity**, **clean water**, and **modern transportation**.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 26% of population\nInternet Penetration: 0.1%\nRoad Network: 25,554 km, mostly unpaved and poorly maintained\nRail Network: 7,435 km\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 5\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nNorth Korea's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with many of its systems and facilities in need of significant repair and modernization. Recent investments have been made in select areas, such as the renovation of major highways and the expansion of the rail network, but much work remains to be done. The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is particularly pronounced, with cities like **Pyongyang** enjoying relatively better access to basic services like electricity and clean water, while rural areas often struggle with limited or non-existent access to these essentials.\n\nThe government has made efforts to improve the country's infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on showcasing its development achievements to the international community. However, these efforts have been hindered by **international sanctions** and a lack of foreign investment, which have limited the country's ability to secure the resources and expertise needed to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects. As a result, many of North Korea's infrastructure systems remain in a state of disrepair, with frequent **power outages** and **transportation disruptions** a common occurrence.\n\nDespite these challenges, North Korea has made some progress in developing its infrastructure in recent years, particularly in the areas of **information technology** and **renewable energy**. The country has invested in the development of its **fiber optic network**, and has also made efforts to promote the use of **solar** and **wind power** as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. However, much work remains to be done to bring the country's infrastructure up to modern standards, and to address the significant disparities in access to basic services that exist between urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 25,554 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved and poorly maintained, with frequent traffic disruptions |\n| Railways | 7,435 km | Moderate | Electrified in some areas, but often subject to delays and cancellations |\n| Airports | 3 international, 10 domestic | Poor | Limited international connections and outdated facilities |\n| Ports | 5 major | Moderate | Handling limited volumes of international trade, with some investment in modernization |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- North Korea's **power generation** is primarily based on **coal** and **hydroelectric** sources, with some limited investment in **renewable energy**.\n- The country's **electricity grid** is often unreliable, with frequent **power outages** and **brownouts** a common occurrence.\n- **Energy efficiency** is a significant concern, with many buildings and homes lacking basic insulation and energy-saving measures.\n- The government has made efforts to promote the use of **solar** and **wind power**, but these sources still account for a relatively small percentage of the country's overall energy mix.\n- **International sanctions** have limited the country's ability to secure the resources and expertise needed to undertake large-scale energy projects.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern in North Korea, with many areas lacking access to **clean drinking water**.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many homes and buildings lacking basic **sewerage** and **waste management** facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is often limited, with many communities relying on **wells** and **springs** for their daily water needs.\n- The government has made efforts to improve **water treatment** and **sanitation** facilities, but much work remains to be done to address the significant disparities in access to these basic services.\n- **International aid** has played a critical role in supporting the development of North Korea's water and sanitation infrastructure, but more assistance is needed to address the country's significant needs in this area.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread in North Korea, with many areas having access to **3G** and **4G** networks.\n- **Fiber optic** connections are available in some areas, particularly in major cities like **Pyongyang**.\n- **Internet access** is highly restricted, with only a limited number of **approved websites** and **online services** available to the general public.\n- **Postal services** are available, but often slow and unreliable, with **international mail** subject to significant delays and censorship.\n- The government has made efforts to promote the development of the country's **information technology** sector, but significant restrictions on **internet freedom** and **online expression** remain in place.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Pyongyang-Mount Kumgang** highway is a major infrastructure project that has been underway in recent years, with the goal of improving **transportation links** between the capital and the country's eastern regions.\n- The **Rason** economic zone is a **special economic zone** that has been established to promote **foreign investment** and **trade**, with a focus on developing the country's **infrastructure** and **industry**.\n- The **Tanchon** port development project is a major initiative aimed at expanding the country's **port facilities** and **international trade** capabilities.\n- **International aid** has played a critical role in supporting the development of North Korea's infrastructure, with organizations like the **United Nations** and the **Red Cross** providing significant assistance in areas like **water and sanitation** and **energy**.\n- The **Kaesong** industrial complex is a major **industrial park** that has been established to promote **economic cooperation** and **investment** between North and South Korea, with a focus on developing the country's **infrastructure** and **industry**.",
