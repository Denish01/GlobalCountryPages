[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in North Korea is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages affecting many areas of the country. The costs of utilities in North Korea can fluctuate greatly depending on the season, with winter months often seeing higher costs due to increased demand for heating. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities remains relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

The quality of utility services in North Korea varies greatly depending on the location, with cities like Pyongyang generally having better access to reliable utilities than rural areas. The government has invested in upgrading the country's utility infrastructure, but much work remains to be done to bring the system up to modern standards. As a result, the cost of utilities in North Korea can be unpredictable and may vary greatly from one month to the next.
