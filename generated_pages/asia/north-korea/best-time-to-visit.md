[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
North Korea has a **temperate climate** with four distinct seasons, characterized by cold winters and hot, humid summers. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal region, the mountains, and the interior plains. The coastal region has a milder climate, with warmer winters and cooler summers, while the mountains are colder and snowier. The interior plains have a more extreme climate, with cold winters and hot summers. The dry season, which runs from September to November, is the best time to visit, with clear skies and comfortable temperatures. The wet season, which runs from June to August, is characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it a less desirable time to visit.

The seasons have a significant impact on travel in North Korea. During the winter months, many tourist attractions are closed, and the roads can be icy and treacherous. In the summer, the heat and humidity can be oppressive, making outdoor activities uncomfortable. The spring and autumn months, on the other hand, offer mild temperatures and fewer crowds, making them ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities.

The **weather** in North Korea can be unpredictable, with sudden changes in temperature and precipitation. It is essential to pack accordingly, with warm clothing for the winter months and light, breathable clothing for the summer months. The country's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the mountains creating a rain shadow effect that affects the distribution of precipitation.
