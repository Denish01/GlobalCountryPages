[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in North Korea is theoretically universal, with all citizens entitled to free medical care. However, in reality, the system is plagued by shortages of medical supplies, equipment, and trained personnel, particularly in rural areas. The quality of care varies significantly depending on the location, with **Pyongyang**, the capital city, having the best-equipped and staffed hospitals. Rural areas, on the other hand, often have limited access to basic medical care, let alone specialized treatments. The system is also heavily reliant on traditional **Korean medicine**, which, while culturally significant, may not always provide the most effective treatment for modern diseases.

The public healthcare system in North Korea is the primary provider of medical care, with private healthcare options virtually non-existent. However, there are some specialized hospitals and clinics that cater to foreigners and high-ranking government officials, which may offer better quality care. Despite the theoretical universality of the system, many North Koreans, particularly those in rural areas, rely on **traditional healers** and **self-medication** due to the lack of access to modern medical care.

The urban-rural divide in healthcare access is a significant challenge in North Korea. While cities like **Pyongyang** and **Kaesong** have relatively well-equipped hospitals and a higher concentration of medical professionals, rural areas often have limited access to even basic medical care. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating health problems and contributing to higher mortality rates.
