The country also has two directly governed cities, Pyongyang and Rason, which are not part of any province. Additionally, there are three special administrative regions, including the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region and the Kaesong Industrial Region. The provinces are the primary administrative divisions, and they are responsible for managing the local economy, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe administrative structure of North Korea is highly centralized, with the government in Pyongyang exercising control over all aspects of life. The provinces and cities have limited autonomy, and decisions are often made by the central government. This has resulted in a relatively uniform culture and economy across the country, with limited regional variations. However, there are some differences between the provinces, particularly in terms of their natural resources, climate, and historical significance.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Pyongyang** (2.8M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: Pyongyang is the largest city in North Korea and is known for its grand monuments, museums, and historic sites, such as the Mansudae Grand Monument and the Korean Central History Museum.

The country has a single-lane highway system, which is mostly unpaved and in poor condition. Driving conditions can be challenging, particularly in rural areas, where roads are often narrow and winding. However, the government has invested in improving the transportation infrastructure, particularly in the major cities, where roads are generally well-maintained and traffic is relatively light.\n\nDomestic flights are available between the major cities, including Pyongyang, Hamhung, and Chongjin. Trains are also a popular mode of transportation, with regular services connecting the major cities. Buses are widely available, but can be slow and uncomfortable, particularly on long-distance routes. Taxis are also available, but can be expensive and may not always be available. Overall, getting around North Korea can be challenging, particularly for independent travelers, but the country is making efforts to improve its transportation infrastructure and make it more accessible to visitors.",
