        <h2>How North Korea Is Divided</h2>
        <p>North Korea is divided into nine provinces, which are further divided into counties, cities, and districts. The country also has two directly governed cities, Pyongyang and Rason, which are not part of any province. Additionally, there are three special administrative regions, including the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region and the Kaesong Industrial Region. The provinces are the primary administrative divisions, and they are responsible for managing the local economy, education, and healthcare.</p>
        <p>The administrative structure of North Korea is highly centralized, with the government in Pyongyang exercising control over all aspects of life. The provinces and cities have limited autonomy, and decisions are often made by the central government. This has resulted in a relatively uniform culture and economy across the country, with limited regional variations. However, there are some differences between the provinces, particularly in terms of their natural resources, climate, and historical significance.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>North Korea has a relatively well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, and buses connecting the major cities. The country has a single-lane highway system, which is mostly unpaved and in poor condition. Driving conditions can be challenging, particularly in rural areas, where roads are often narrow and winding. However, the government has invested in improving the transportation infrastructure, particularly in the major cities, where roads are generally well-maintained and traffic is relatively light.</p>
        <p>Domestic flights are available between the major cities, including Pyongyang, Hamhung, and Chongjin. Trains are also a popular mode of transportation, with regular services connecting the major cities. Buses are widely available, but can be slow and uncomfortable, particularly on long-distance routes. Taxis are also available, but can be expensive and may not always be available. Overall, getting around North Korea can be challenging, particularly for independent travelers, but the country is making efforts to improve its transportation infrastructure and make it more accessible to visitors.</p>
