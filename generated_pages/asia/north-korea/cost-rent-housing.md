[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The housing market in North Korea is highly controlled and limited, with the government playing a significant role in the allocation and distribution of housing. The rental market is relatively small, and most apartments are state-owned and assigned to citizens based on their occupation, social status, and family size. Typical lease terms are usually long-term, and deposit requirements can be steep, often equivalent to several months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and evictions can occur without much notice. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as South Korea and China, North Korea's housing costs are relatively low, but the quality and availability of housing are also much lower.

The housing market in North Korea is also heavily influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a chronic shortage of housing and a lack of modern amenities. The government has been working to improve the housing stock, but progress has been slow, and many citizens still live in outdated and poorly maintained apartments. For foreigners, the housing options are limited, and they are often restricted to specific areas and buildings. The rent prices for foreigners are also typically higher than for locals, and they may be required to pay in foreign currency.
