[SECTION] Overview: North Korea vs South Korea [/SECTION]
The cost of living in North Korea is substantially lower than in South Korea, primarily due to the significant differences in their economic systems and standards of living. North Korea's economy is largely isolated and centralized, with a focus on state-controlled industries, whereas South Korea has a highly developed, market-based economy with a strong focus on technology, manufacturing, and international trade. As a result, the cost of goods and services in North Korea is generally much lower, although the availability and quality of these items can be limited.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. North Korea's economy has been subject to international sanctions and trade restrictions, which have limited its access to foreign goods and services. In contrast, South Korea has a highly globalized economy with strong trade relationships with other countries, which has driven up the cost of living. Overall, North Korea is generally 70-80% cheaper than South Korea, although the quality and availability of goods and services can vary significantly.
