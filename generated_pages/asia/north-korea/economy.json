The country is classified as a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $480. The economy has been heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China, due to a lack of domestic resources and infrastructure. The development level of the economy is relatively low, with a focus on heavy industry and manufacturing. The trajectory of the economy has been marked by periods of stagnation and decline, particularly in the 1990s, due to a combination of factors including international sanctions, natural disasters, and a decline in Soviet aid.\n\nThe economy is driven primarily by state-owned enterprises, with the government controlling key sectors such as coal mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. The private sector is relatively small, with most economic activity taking place in the informal sector. The government has implemented various economic reforms in recent years, including the introduction of special economic zones and the expansion of foreign trade. However, the economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and imports, and the international community has imposed various sanctions on the country due to concerns over its nuclear program.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the economy, North Korea has made efforts to develop its infrastructure and promote economic growth. The government has invested in various projects, including the development of special economic zones and the expansion of the country's transportation network. However, the economy remains heavily isolated, and the lack of international engagement and investment has limited its potential for growth.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Coal Mining | 20% of GDP | North Korea has significant coal reserves, and coal mining is a major contributor to the country's economy |\n| Manufacturing | 30% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is primarily focused on the production of textiles, machinery, and other heavy industrial goods |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Agriculture is a significant sector in North Korea, with the country producing a range of crops including rice, corn, and potatoes |\n| Services | 10% of GDP | The services sector is relatively underdeveloped, but includes industries such as tourism and financial services |\n| Construction | 10% of GDP | The construction sector has grown in recent years, driven by government investment in infrastructure projects |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Coal**: North Korea's coal exports are a significant contributor to the country's economy, with the majority being exported to China\n- **Iron ore**: The country's iron ore deposits are also an important export commodity\n- **Textiles**: North Korea's textile industry is a significant sector, with the country producing a range of clothing and other textile products\n- **Machinery**: The country's manufacturing sector also produces a range of machinery, including heavy industrial equipment\n- **Seafood**: North Korea's seafood industry is a significant export earner, with the country producing a range of seafood products including fish and shellfish\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Petroleum products**: North Korea is heavily reliant on imports of petroleum products, including oil and gasoline\n- **Food**: The country is also a significant importer of food, including rice and other staple crops\n- **Machinery**: North Korea imports a range of machinery, including heavy industrial equipment and electronics\n- **Chemicals**: The country is also a significant importer of chemicals, including fertilizers and other industrial chemicals\n- **Consumer goods**: The country imports a range of consumer goods, including clothing and other household items\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: China is North Korea's largest trading partner, accounting for the majority of the country's exports and imports\n- South Korea: South Korea is also a significant trading partner, despite tensions between the two countries\n- Russia: Russia is another key trading partner, with the country importing a range of goods including oil and machinery\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country's transportation network is relatively underdeveloped, with a limited number of roads and railways\n- The energy sector is also underdeveloped, with the country relying heavily on imports of petroleum products\n- Internet and mobile penetration is extremely low, with the country having one of the lowest levels of internet access in the world\n- The country has a number of ports, including the port of Nampo, which is a significant hub for international trade\n- The country also has a number of airports, including the Pyongyang Sunan International Airport, which is the country's main international airport\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe economic outlook for North Korea is uncertain, with the country facing a range of challenges including international sanctions and a lack of investment.
