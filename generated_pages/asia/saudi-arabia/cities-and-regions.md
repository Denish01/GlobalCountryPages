[SECTION] How Saudi Arabia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Saudi Arabia is divided into 13 provinces, also known as emirates, which are further subdivided into governorates and municipalities. The provinces are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and they are responsible for providing various government services to the population. The 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia are Riyadh, Makkah, Madinah, Qassim, Eastern Province, Asir, Tabuk, Hail, Northern Borders, Jazan, Najran, Al Bahah, and Al Jawf.

The provinces are governed by emirs, who are appointed by the King, and they have a significant degree of autonomy in managing the affairs of their respective provinces. The provinces are also responsible for collecting taxes, providing education and healthcare services, and maintaining law and order. The division of Saudi Arabia into provinces has helped to promote regional development and has enabled the government to provide services to the population more effectively.
