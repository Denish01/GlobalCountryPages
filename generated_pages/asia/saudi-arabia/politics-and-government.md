[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Saudi Arabia is based on the **Quran** and the **Sunnah**, which are the primary sources of law in the country. The monarch, currently King Salman, serves as the head of state and head of government, and has absolute authority over the government and the people. The monarch is advised by the **Majlis ash-Shura**, a 150-member advisory council, but the monarch is not bound by their advice. The government is divided into several ministries, each responsible for a specific area of policy, such as defense, finance, and education. The **Council of Senior Scholars**, a group of high-ranking clergy, also plays an important role in advising the monarch on matters of law and policy.

The **separation of powers** is not a feature of the Saudi Arabian government, as the monarch has absolute authority over the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The government is a **unitary state**, with all power concentrated in the central government. The monarch has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers, as well as to promulgate laws and decrees. The **Majlis ash-Shura** has a limited role in the government, and is primarily responsible for advising the monarch on matters of policy.

The **sharia law** is the basis of the Saudi Arabian legal system, and is used to govern all aspects of life in the country. The law is based on the **Quran** and the **Sunnah**, and is interpreted by **Islamic scholars**. The legal system is **inquisitorial**, with judges playing an active role in investigating and deciding cases. The **death penalty** is still used in Saudi Arabia, and is applied for a range of crimes, including murder, treason, and blasphemy.
