Citizens of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates can enter Saudi Arabia without a visa. However, citizens of other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, require a visa to enter the country. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism, business, and cultural exchange.\n\nThe Saudi government has introduced various types of visas, including tourist visas, business visas, and work visas, to cater to different categories of visitors. The visa application process typically involves submitting required documents, paying the applicable fee, and waiting for the visa to be processed.
