The 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia are Riyadh, Makkah, Madinah, Qassim, Eastern Province, Asir, Tabuk, Hail, Northern Borders, Jazan, Najran, Al Bahah, and Al Jawf.\n\nThe provinces are governed by emirs, who are appointed by the King, and they have a significant degree of autonomy in managing the affairs of their respective provinces.
