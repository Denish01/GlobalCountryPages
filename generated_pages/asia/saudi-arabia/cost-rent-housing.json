Typical lease terms in Saudi Arabia are one to three years, with a security deposit usually equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Saudi law, and tenants are entitled to a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the tenancy. Compared to its regional neighbors, Saudi Arabia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in countries such as Bahrain and Qatar, but higher than in countries such as Jordan and Iraq.\n\nThe housing market in Saudi Arabia is also influenced by the government's efforts to increase homeownership among citizens, which has led to a surge in demand for housing units. This has resulted in a shortage of rental properties in some areas, particularly in the larger cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah. However, the government has also implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights, such as capping rent increases and requiring landlords to provide written contracts.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$900 | $400-$700 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $500-$900 | standard size, moderate amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$1,800 | $800-$1,400 | family size, good amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,200-$2,000 | spacious, high-end amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$4,000 | prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | residential areas, moderate demand |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | limited amenities, lower demand |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Diplomatic Quarter** in Riyadh: $1,000-$1,500 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its modern amenities and secure environment\n- **King Fahad District** in Riyadh: $800-$1,200 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, popular among expats for its proximity to shopping centers and restaurants\n- **Al-Rawdah District** in Jeddah: $600-$1,000 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a coastal neighborhood with a mix of modern and traditional architecture\n- **Al-Khobar** in the Eastern Province: $500-$900 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a popular area for expats working in the oil and gas industry\n- **Nakheel District** in Riyadh: $400-$800 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a family-friendly neighborhood with good schools and amenities\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Saudi Arabia [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the contract before signing\n- Be aware of scams, such as fake listings or agents demanding unnecessary fees\n- Utilities such as electricity and water are usually not included in the rent\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished ones, but can be found in some neighborhoods\n- [CALLOUT] Be sure to check the property's **Ejari** registration, which is a government-mandated system for registering rental contracts, to ensure your rights as a tenant are protected.",
