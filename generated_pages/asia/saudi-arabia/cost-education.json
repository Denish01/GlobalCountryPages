Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. On the other hand, private schools offer higher quality education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is Arabic, but English is also widely taught, especially in private schools. Compulsory education in Saudi Arabia lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, intermediate, and secondary levels. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.\n\nThe quality of education in Saudi Arabia has been improving in recent years, with the government investing heavily in education infrastructure and teacher training. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including a shortage of qualified teachers and a lack of resources in some schools. Despite these challenges, Saudi Arabia has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with enrollment rates rising significantly in recent years. The country has also introduced a number of initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and the establishment of specialized schools for gifted students.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 - $100 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Primary | $2,000 - $5,000 | Range by tier, higher quality |\n| Public Secondary | $0 - $200 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Secondary | $3,000 - $7,000 | Range by tier, higher quality |\n| International School | $8,000 - $15,000 | Curriculum types, such as British or American |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000 - $2,000 | $2,000 - $5,000 | Subsidized for locals |\n| Private University | $5,000 - $10,000 | $8,000 - $15,000 | Higher quality, range by institution |\n| Top-Ranked University | $8,000 - $15,000 | $10,000 - $20,000 | King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200 - $500 | Range by quality and location |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20 - $50 | Range by subject and tutor qualifications |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100 - $300 | Range by language and institution |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50 - $100 | Basic supplies, such as notebooks and pens |\n| School Uniform | $50 - $100 | Mandatory for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Saudi Arabia are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and high-quality education.\n- Scholarships are available for students, including government scholarships for Saudi nationals and private scholarships for international students.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Saudi Arabia, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The quality of education in Saudi Arabia is generally high, especially in private and international schools, but can vary in public schools.\n- **English language proficiency** is highly valued in Saudi Arabia, and students who speak English fluently have a significant advantage in the job market.\n- Parents should research schools thoroughly and consider factors such as curriculum, teacher qualifications, and extracurricular activities when choosing a school for their child.",
