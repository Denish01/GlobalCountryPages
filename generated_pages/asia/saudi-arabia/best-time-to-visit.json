Peak season: December and January. Budget season: November and February. Avoid: June, July, and August due to the extreme heat and Ramadan, which can affect tourist activities and business hours. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nSaudi Arabia has a diverse climate, with different regions experiencing varying weather conditions. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the desert climate in the north and west, and the tropical climate in the south. The dry season, which lasts from June to September, is characterized by extremely high temperatures, often reaching 45°C (113°F) in the desert regions. In contrast, the wet season, which occurs from October to May, brings mild temperatures and occasional rainfall. The seasons significantly affect travel in Saudi Arabia, as the extreme heat during the dry season can make outdoor activities challenging, while the wet season offers more comfortable temperatures, making it ideal for exploring the country's historical sites, museums, and natural wonders.\n\nThe winter months, from December to February, are the coolest and most pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). This period is ideal for visiting the northern regions, including the capital city Riyadh, and exploring the country's historical sites, such as the ancient city of Diriyah. The spring months, from March to May, are also a good time to visit, as the temperatures are mild, and the landscapes are lush and green.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that Saudi Arabia is a conservative country, and tourists should be respectful of the local culture and customs. During the month of Ramadan, which can fall in different months of the year, tourist activities and business hours may be affected, and visitors should be prepared for changes in schedules and availability of services.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Mild, 15-25°C (59-77°F) | Low | $ | Visiting historical sites, outdoor activities |\n| February | Mild, 15-25°C (59-77°F) | Low | $ | Exploring Riyadh, attending cultural events |\n| March | Pleasant, 20-30°C (68-86°F) | Medium | $$ | Visiting the ancient city of Diriyah, hiking |\n| April | Warm, 25-35°C (77-95°F) | Medium | $$ | Attending festivals, visiting the Red Sand Dunes |\n| May | Hot, 30-40°C (86-104°F) | High | $$$ | Visiting the coastal cities, such as Jeddah |\n| June | Extremely hot, 40-45°C (104-113°F) | Low | $ | Avoiding outdoor activities, staying in air-conditioned spaces |\n| July | Extremely hot, 40-45°C (104-113°F) | Low | $ | Visiting indoor attractions, such as museums |\n| August | Extremely hot, 40-45°C (104-113°F) | Low | $ | Taking a break from outdoor activities |\n| September | Hot, 35-40°C (95-104°F) | Medium | $$ | Visiting the southern regions, such as Abha |\n| October | Warm, 25-35°C (77-95°F) | Medium | $$ | Exploring the desert landscapes, attending outdoor events |\n| November | Mild, 20-30°C (68-86°F) | Medium | $$ | Visiting the historical sites, attending cultural festivals |\n| December | Mild, 15-25°C (59-77°F) | High | $$$ | Attending Christmas markets, visiting the winter festivals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Janadriyah Festival** | February-March | A cultural festival showcasing Saudi Arabian heritage and traditions |\n| **Riyadh Season** | October-December | A series of events and festivals celebrating Saudi Arabian culture, entertainment, and sports |\n| **Jeddah Festival** | June-July | A summer festival featuring music, dance, and theater performances |\n| **Hajj Pilgrimage** | July-August | A sacred Islamic pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca |\n| **Saudi National Day** | September | A celebration of Saudi Arabian independence and national pride |\n| **Red Sea International Film Festival** | November-December | A film festival showcasing Saudi Arabian and international cinema |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The northern regions, including Riyadh, experience a dry and cold winter, making it ideal to visit from December to February.\n- The southern regions, including Abha and Jazan, have a more temperate climate, with mild winters and hot summers, making it suitable to visit from October to April.\n- The coastal cities, such as Jeddah and Dammam, have a hot and humid climate, with high temperatures throughout the year, making it best to visit from November to March.\n- The desert regions, including the Rub' al Khali, are extremely hot during the summer months, making it advisable to visit from October to April.\n- The mountainous regions, including the Asir Mountains, have a cooler climate, with mild temperatures and occasional rainfall, making it ideal to visit from March to November.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book flights and accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from November to February, to avoid the crowds and enjoy more comfortable temperatures.\n- Pack light and breathable clothing, as well as sun protection, to cope with the extreme heat during the summer months.\n- Respect local customs and traditions, especially during Ramadan, by dressing modestly and avoiding public displays of affection.\n- Stay hydrated and take breaks in air-conditioned spaces to avoid heat exhaustion.\n- Learn some basic Arabic phrases, such as \"marhaba\" (hello) and \"shukraan\" (thank you), to show respect for the local culture.",
