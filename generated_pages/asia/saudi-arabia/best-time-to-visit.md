[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Saudi Arabia has a diverse climate, with different regions experiencing varying weather conditions. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the desert climate in the north and west, and the tropical climate in the south. The dry season, which lasts from June to September, is characterized by extremely high temperatures, often reaching 45°C (113°F) in the desert regions. In contrast, the wet season, which occurs from October to May, brings mild temperatures and occasional rainfall. The seasons significantly affect travel in Saudi Arabia, as the extreme heat during the dry season can make outdoor activities challenging, while the wet season offers more comfortable temperatures, making it ideal for exploring the country's historical sites, museums, and natural wonders.

The winter months, from December to February, are the coolest and most pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). This period is ideal for visiting the northern regions, including the capital city Riyadh, and exploring the country's historical sites, such as the ancient city of Diriyah. The spring months, from March to May, are also a good time to visit, as the temperatures are mild, and the landscapes are lush and green.

However, it's essential to note that Saudi Arabia is a conservative country, and tourists should be respectful of the local culture and customs. During the month of Ramadan, which can fall in different months of the year, tourist activities and business hours may be affected, and visitors should be prepared for changes in schedules and availability of services.
