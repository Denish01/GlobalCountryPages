[SECTION] Overview: Saudi Arabia vs Iran [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Saudi Arabia and Iran varies significantly, reflecting the two countries' distinct economic contexts. Saudi Arabia, with its high GDP per capita and relatively low inflation rate, is a more expensive country to live in, particularly when it comes to housing and transportation. Iran, on the other hand, has a lower GDP per capita and a higher inflation rate, which contributes to its lower cost of living. Overall, Iran is generally cheaper than Saudi Arabia, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living.

In contrast, Iran's economy has been subject to international sanctions, which have contributed to its higher inflation rate and lower standard of living.
