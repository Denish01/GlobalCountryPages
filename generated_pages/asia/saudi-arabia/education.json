  "content": "The education system in Saudi Arabia is a comprehensive and well-structured network of institutions that provide students with a wide range of academic and vocational programs, from primary to tertiary levels, with a strong emphasis on Islamic studies and Arabic language.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 95.2%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Arabic\nAcademic Calendar: September to June\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 500 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Saudi Arabia is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12, focuses on basic subjects such as Arabic, mathematics, science, and Islamic studies. Secondary education, which is also compulsory, is divided into two stages: intermediate and secondary. The intermediate stage, which lasts for three years, prepares students for the secondary stage, which is a two-year program that culminates in a national exam. Tertiary education, which is not compulsory, includes universities, colleges, and vocational training institutions that offer a wide range of academic and professional programs. The quality of education in Saudi Arabia is generally high, with a strong emphasis on Islamic studies and Arabic language. Public education is free and available to all citizens, while private education is also available for those who can afford it.\n\nThe education system in Saudi Arabia is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for developing and implementing education policies, as well as supervising and evaluating the performance of schools and universities. The ministry has implemented a number of reforms in recent years, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods, as well as the expansion of vocational training programs. Despite these efforts, the education system in Saudi Arabia still faces a number of challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of opportunities for female students.\n\nThe public and private education sectors in Saudi Arabia have different strengths and weaknesses. The public sector is free and accessible to all citizens, but it often suffers from overcrowding and a lack of resources. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher quality education and better facilities, but it is expensive and only accessible to those who can afford it. Overall, the education system in Saudi Arabia is well-structured and provides students with a wide range of academic and vocational programs, but it still faces a number of challenges that need to be addressed.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
