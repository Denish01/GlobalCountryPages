Saudi Arabia has a high standard of living, with modern amenities and a strong economy, while Yemen has been affected by conflict and economic instability, leading to a lower cost of living. Overall, Yemen is generally cheaper than Saudi Arabia, with a cost of living that is approximately 30-40% lower. This is due to lower prices for housing, food, and transportation in Yemen.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in the cost of living. Saudi Arabia has a strong economy driven by oil exports, while Yemen's economy has been affected by conflict and instability. As a result, Saudi Arabia has a higher GDP per capita and a lower inflation rate than Yemen. However, despite the higher cost of living in Saudi Arabia, the country offers a high standard of living and modern amenities, making it an attractive destination for expats and tourists.
