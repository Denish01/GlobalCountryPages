[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Saudi Arabia is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. On the other hand, private schools offer higher quality education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is Arabic, but English is also widely taught, especially in private schools. Compulsory education in Saudi Arabia lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, intermediate, and secondary levels. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.

The quality of education in Saudi Arabia has been improving in recent years, with the government investing heavily in education infrastructure and teacher training. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including a shortage of qualified teachers and a lack of resources in some schools. Despite these challenges, Saudi Arabia has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with enrollment rates rising significantly in recent years. The country has also introduced a number of initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and the establishment of specialized schools for gifted students.
