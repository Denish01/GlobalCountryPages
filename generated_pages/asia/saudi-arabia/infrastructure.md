[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Saudi Arabia has made substantial progress in developing its infrastructure, driven by large-scale investments in various sectors. The country's infrastructure development is part of its **Vision 2030** plan, which aims to reduce its dependence on oil exports and diversify its economy. The government has invested heavily in modernizing its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, railways, airports, and seaports. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with the latter often lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity and clean water.

The Saudi government has implemented various initiatives to address the urban-rural divide, including the development of new cities and economic zones. These projects aim to create new economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for citizens in rural areas. Despite these efforts, the country still faces challenges in providing adequate infrastructure services to its rapidly growing population. The government is working to address these challenges through public-private partnerships and foreign investments.

Saudi Arabia's infrastructure development has also been driven by its strategic location, which makes it an important hub for international trade and commerce. The country's **Red Sea** coast and **Persian Gulf** coast provide access to major shipping lanes, while its extensive road network and railway system connect it to neighboring countries. The government is investing in the development of new logistics and transportation infrastructure, including airports, seaports, and dry ports, to further enhance the country's connectivity and competitiveness.
