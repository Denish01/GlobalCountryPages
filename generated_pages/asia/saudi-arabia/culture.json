  "content": "[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]\nSaudi Arabia's culture is deeply rooted in its Islamic heritage and traditions. The country is home to the two holiest sites in Islam, Mecca and Medina, which attracts millions of pilgrims every year. The Saudi culture is defined by its strong sense of hospitality, respect for elders, and conservative values. The official language is Arabic, and the majority of the population is ethnically Arab. However, the country has a significant expatriate population, with many foreigners working in the oil and gas industry. The culture is also influenced by its Bedouin traditions, with many Saudis still maintaining strong ties to their tribal heritage.\n\nThe Saudi society is largely patriarchal, with men holding positions of authority in both family and business. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend towards women's empowerment, with more women entering the workforce and participating in public life. The country has also seen a surge in young, educated Saudis who are eager to modernize and diversify the economy. Despite these changes, the Saudi culture remains deeply conservative, with a strong emphasis on traditional values and customs. Visitors to the country should be respectful of these customs, particularly when interacting with locals or visiting sacred sites.\n\nThe ethnic and linguistic makeup of Saudi Arabia is relatively homogeneous, with the majority of the population being Arab. However, there are also significant minority groups, including Asians, Africans, and Europeans, who have come to the country as expatriate workers. The official language is Arabic, but English is widely spoken, particularly among businesspeople and government officials. Visitors who speak Arabic will find it easier to navigate the country and interact with locals, but it is not necessary to speak the language to have a successful trip.\n\n[SECTION] Food & Cuisine [/SECTION]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Must-Try? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kabsa | Main Course | A traditional Saudi dish made with rice, meat, and spices | Yes |\n| Shawarma | Street Food | A popular Middle Eastern sandwich made with grilled meat and served in a pita bread | Yes |\n| Gormeh | Stew | A hearty stew made with lamb, vegetables, and dried lime | Yes |\n| Falafel | Appetizer | Crispy, flavorful chickpea patties served with tahini sauce | Yes |\n| Luqaimat | Dessert | Sweet, dumpling-like pastries filled with dates and nuts | Yes |\n| Jareesh | Side Dish | A traditional Saudi salad made with crushed wheat, onions, and spices | No |\n| Karak | Drink | A sweet, spiced tea that is popular in Saudi Arabia | Yes |\n| Saleeg | Main Course | A traditional Saudi dish made with rice, chicken, and spices | Yes |\n\nEating customs in Saudi Arabia are deeply rooted in hospitality and generosity.

It is customary to eat with the right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean.
