[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Saudi Arabia is situated in the Middle East, on the Asian continent. It is bordered by several countries, including Jordan to the northwest, Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Bahrain to the east, Qatar to the southeast, the United Arab Emirates to the southeast, Oman to the south, and Yemen to the south. The country is surrounded by two major bodies of water: the Red Sea to the west and the Persian Gulf to the east. This strategic location has made Saudi Arabia a significant player in regional and global trade.

The country's borders are a mix of land and sea boundaries, with a total length of approximately 4,431 kilometers. The border with Jordan is about 731 kilometers long, while the border with Iraq is about 814 kilometers long. The coastline along the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf provides Saudi Arabia with access to major shipping lanes and ports. The country's location has also made it a key player in the regional economy, with many neighboring countries relying on Saudi Arabia for trade and energy exports.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The terrain of Saudi Arabia is dominated by vast deserts, including the **Arabian Desert**, which covers most of the country. The desert landscape is characterized by sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and oases. The country's mountain ranges, including the **Hejaz Mountains** and the **Asir Mountains**, are located in the western and southwestern regions. These mountain ranges are home to some of the country's highest peaks, including Jabal Sawda, which is the highest point in Saudi Arabia.

The country's coastline along the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf is generally flat and sandy, with some rocky outcrops and coral reefs. The **Tihamah coastal plain**, which runs along the Red Sea coast, is a narrow strip of land that is home to many of the country's major ports and cities. The **Nejd plateau**, which covers much of the central and eastern regions, is a vast, arid plateau that is home to many of the country's oil fields.

The country's rivers are mostly seasonal, with the **Wadi al-Rummah** being one of the longest and most significant. The wadi, which flows through the Nejd plateau, is an important source of water for irrigation and drinking. The country's lack of permanent rivers and lakes has made it necessary to rely on **desalination plants** and **groundwater** for drinking water.
