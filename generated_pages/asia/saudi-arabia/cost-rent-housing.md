[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Saudi Arabia is relatively competitive, with a wide range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Typical lease terms in Saudi Arabia are one to three years, with a security deposit usually equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Saudi law, and tenants are entitled to a written contract that outlines the terms and conditions of the tenancy. Compared to its regional neighbors, Saudi Arabia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in countries such as Bahrain and Qatar, but higher than in countries such as Jordan and Iraq.

The housing market in Saudi Arabia is also influenced by the government's efforts to increase homeownership among citizens, which has led to a surge in demand for housing units. This has resulted in a shortage of rental properties in some areas, particularly in the larger cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah. However, the government has also implemented measures to regulate the rental market and protect tenants' rights, such as capping rent increases and requiring landlords to provide written contracts.
