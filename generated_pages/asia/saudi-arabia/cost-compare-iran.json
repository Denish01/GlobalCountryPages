Saudi Arabia, with its high GDP per capita and relatively low inflation rate, is a more expensive country to live in, particularly when it comes to housing and transportation. Iran, on the other hand, has a lower GDP per capita and a higher inflation rate, which contributes to its lower cost of living. Overall, Iran is generally cheaper than Saudi Arabia, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Saudi Arabia has a more diversified economy, with a strong oil and gas sector, while Iran's economy is more heavily reliant on oil exports. This diversification has contributed to Saudi Arabia's higher cost of living, as well as its higher standard of living. In contrast, Iran's economy has been subject to international sanctions, which have contributed to its higher inflation rate and lower standard of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Iran (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 400 | 50% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 250 | 50% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,800 | 900 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Iran (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 5 | 66% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 200 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 5 | 2 | 60% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Iran (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 20 | 60% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.50 | 0.25 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Iran (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 100 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Iran (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,500 | 37% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Saudi Arabia is cheaper for:**\n- High-end electronics and luxury goods, due to its more developed retail sector\n- International flights, due to its more extensive airline network\n- Business services, such as conferences and meetings, due to its more developed business infrastructure\n- **Iran is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation, particularly outside of city centers\n- Food, particularly traditional Iranian cuisine\n- Transportation, particularly taxis and public transportation\n- Utilities, particularly electricity and water\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIran's lower cost of living makes it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees on a budget.
