        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Saudi Arabia has a high-income economy, driven primarily by its vast oil and gas reserves. The country has been undergoing significant economic development and diversification efforts in recent years, with a focus on reducing its dependence on oil exports and promoting private sector growth. As the largest economy in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is a major player in regional trade and commerce. The government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate economic growth, including investments in infrastructure, tourism, and manufacturing.</p>
        <p>The Saudi Arabian economy is characterized by a high level of government involvement, with state-owned enterprises playing a significant role in key sectors such as energy, finance, and industry. However, the government has been actively promoting privatization and encouraging foreign investment to diversify the economy and create new opportunities for growth. The country's economic development is also driven by its strategic location, with access to major shipping lanes and proximity to key markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges posed by fluctuations in global oil prices, Saudi Arabia's economy has shown resilience and adaptability, with a strong focus on long-term development and diversification. The government's Vision 2030 plan aims to reduce the country's dependence on oil exports, promote private sector growth, and develop a more diversified economy. This plan has been instrumental in driving economic reform and promoting investment in key sectors such as tourism, manufacturing, and renewable energy.</p>
