However, the cost of food in Qatar is generally higher compared to other countries in the region, due to the country's reliance on imports and high demand for luxury and high-end products.

The country's **health expenditure per capita** of $1,804 and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 7.4% also indicate a high standard of living, which can contribute to higher food prices.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of food products can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Qatar. Supermarkets like Carrefour and Lulu Hypermarket tend to offer a wider range of products, including international brands, but at a higher price. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at a lower price, but with limited options. It is recommended to buy fresh produce, meat, and dairy products from local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods and international brands. Bargaining is not common in supermarkets, but it is expected in local markets, where prices can be negotiated.

In general, local markets offer better value for money, especially for traditional products like dates, spices, and Arabic sweets. However, the quality and hygiene of products can vary, and it is essential to check the freshness and expiration dates before purchasing. Supermarkets, on the other hand, offer a more convenient and hygienic shopping experience, but at a higher price. It is recommended to visit both supermarkets and local markets to get a feel for the prices and products available.
