The country aims to attract tourists, business travelers, and foreign investors, and its visa policy is designed to facilitate easy entry for these groups. Citizens of eligible countries can enter Qatar without a visa and stay for a specified period, which varies depending on their nationality.\n\nQatar's visa policy is also designed to promote tourism and business travel. The country offers a range of visa options, including **tourist visas**, **business visas**, and **e-visas**, which can be obtained online or on arrival. The visa application process is relatively straightforward, and the required documents are minimal. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Qatar for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 30 days |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 30 days |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Within a 180-day period |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 30 days |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 30 days |\n| Indian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must meet specific requirements, such as holding a valid passport and return ticket |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance and meet specific requirements |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Qatar visa-free or obtain a **tourist visa** on arrival, which is valid for 30 days and can be extended for an additional 30 days.

The duration of the student visa varies depending on the course of study.\n**Workers:** Workers who wish to work in Qatar must obtain a **work visa**, which requires **sponsorship** from a Qatari employer and a **labor contract**.
