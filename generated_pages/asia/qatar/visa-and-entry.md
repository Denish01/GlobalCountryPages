[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Qatar before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Qatar has a relatively liberal visa policy, offering visa-free access to citizens of over 80 countries. The country aims to attract tourists, business travelers, and foreign investors, and its visa policy is designed to facilitate easy entry for these groups. Citizens of eligible countries can enter Qatar without a visa and stay for a specified period, which varies depending on their nationality.

Qatar's visa policy is also designed to promote tourism and business travel. The country offers a range of visa options, including **tourist visas**, **business visas**, and **e-visas**, which can be obtained online or on arrival. The visa application process is relatively straightforward, and the required documents are minimal. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Qatar for the latest information.

[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]
**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Qatar visa-free or obtain a **tourist visa** on arrival, which is valid for 30 days and can be extended for an additional 30 days. The typical stay for tourists is 7-10 days, and they must meet specific requirements, such as holding a valid passport and return ticket.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may require a **business visa**, which can be obtained in advance or on arrival. They must provide an **invitation letter** from a Qatari company and meet specific requirements, such as holding a valid passport and return ticket. The process for business travelers is similar to that for tourists, but they may require additional documentation.
**Students:** Students who wish to study in Qatar must obtain a **student visa**, which requires **enrollment proof** from a Qatari university and a **sponsorship** letter from a Qatari national or company. The duration of the student visa varies depending on the course of study.
**Workers:** Workers who wish to work in Qatar must obtain a **work visa**, which requires **sponsorship** from a Qatari employer and a **labor contract**. The process for workers is more complex than for tourists or business travelers and requires additional documentation.
