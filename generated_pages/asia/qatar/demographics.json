The country's population has more than tripled in the past two decades, with the majority of the growth attributed to the influx of expatriate workers. Qatar's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate, as the country continues to develop its economy and infrastructure. The urban population accounts for approximately 99% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city of Doha. This high level of urbanization has put pressure on the country's infrastructure and services, but has also contributed to the country's rapid economic growth.\n\nThe population growth trend in Qatar is characterized by a high proportion of young people, with approximately 70% of the population under the age of 30. This demographic trend has significant implications for the country's labor market, education system, and social services. The government has implemented various initiatives to address the challenges posed by this demographic trend, including investing in education and training programs, and promoting private sector employment opportunities.\n\nQatar's migration patterns are also noteworthy, with the country relying heavily on expatriate workers to drive its economy. The majority of these workers come from countries such as India, Nepal, and the Philippines, and are employed in various sectors, including construction, hospitality, and healthcare. The government has implemented various measures to protect the rights of these workers, including introducing a minimum wage and improving living conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Qatari Arabs | 20% | Qatar | Indigenous population |\n| Indian | 25% | India | Largest expatriate community |\n| Nepali | 15% | Nepal | Significant expatriate community |\n| Bangladeshi | 10% | Bangladesh | Expatriate community |\n| Filipino | 5% | Philippines | Expatriate community |\n| Pakistani | 5% | Pakistan | Expatriate community |\n| Sri Lankan | 2% | Sri Lanka | Expatriate community |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic landscape of Qatar is characterized by a diverse mix of nationalities, with Qatari Arabs making up approximately 20% of the population. The majority of the population is comprised of expatriate workers from various countries, including India, Nepal, and the Philippines.
