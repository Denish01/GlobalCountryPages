Qatar has a high-income economy, driven primarily by its large reserves of oil and natural gas. The country has undergone significant development in recent years, with a strong focus on diversification and investment in non-hydrocarbon sectors. Qatar's economy is characterized by a high level of government investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which has contributed to its rapid growth and development. The country has also invested heavily in its financial sector, with the establishment of the Qatar Financial Centre, which aims to attract international banks and financial institutions.

Qatar's economy is also driven by its strategic location, which makes it an important hub for trade and commerce in the Middle East.
