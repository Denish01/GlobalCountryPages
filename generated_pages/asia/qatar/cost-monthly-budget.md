[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Qatar is considered one of the more expensive countries in the Middle East, with a high cost of living that is reflected in its GDP per capita (PPP) of $126,046. However, the country's high standard of living and excellent infrastructure make it an attractive destination for expats and tourists. The budget living tier of $2,500 per month can provide a decent standard of living, but it would require careful budgeting and some compromises on lifestyle. In contrast, the mid-range living tier of $4,000 per month can offer a more comfortable lifestyle, with access to better amenities and services. Compared to neighboring countries such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE, Qatar is generally more expensive, but its unique blend of traditional and modern culture makes it a unique and desirable destination.

The cost of living in Qatar can vary significantly depending on factors such as accommodation, transportation, and lifestyle. For example, renting a one-bedroom apartment in a central location can cost upwards of $1,500 per month, while a similar apartment in a suburban area can cost significantly less. Food prices are also relatively high, with a meal at a mid-range restaurant costing around $15-$20 per person. However, the country's excellent transportation system and relatively low cost of utilities can help to offset some of these expenses. Overall, Qatar's high cost of living is balanced by its excellent standard of living and unique cultural experiences, making it an attractive destination for those who can afford it.
