The public healthcare system is managed by the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), which operates several hospitals and primary healthcare centers across the country. In addition to the public system, there are also many private hospitals and clinics that offer high-quality medical care, often with modern facilities and equipment. The quality of care in Qatar is generally excellent, with many medical professionals trained in the UK, US, or other developed countries. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with more specialized facilities and expertise available in cities like Doha.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Qatar is generally free or low-cost for citizens, while expatriates and visitors may need to pay for medical services or have private health insurance. The government has also implemented a national health insurance scheme, which provides coverage for all citizens and residents. Despite these advances, there may be some challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly for those who do not speak Arabic or are not familiar with the local healthcare system.\n\nQatar has made significant investments in its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on developing its infrastructure, technology, and human resources. The country has also established several specialized medical centers, including the **National Center for Cancer Care and Research** and the **Heart Hospital**, which provide advanced medical care and treatment for a range of conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hamad
