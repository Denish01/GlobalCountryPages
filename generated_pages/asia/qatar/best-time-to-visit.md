[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Qatar has a **desert climate**, characterized by very little rainfall and high temperatures throughout the year. The country experiences two main seasons: a hot and dry summer, and a mild and relatively cool winter. The summer months, from June to September, are extremely hot, with temperatures often reaching 45°C (113°F) or more. In contrast, the winter months, from December to February, are mild and pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C (59°F) to 25°C (77°F). This significant variation in temperature affects travel plans, as the hot summer months can be challenging for outdoor activities, while the mild winter months are ideal for sightseeing and exploring the country.

The **dry season**, which lasts from October to May, is the best time to visit Qatar, as the weather is generally dry and sunny. The **wet season**, from June to September, is characterized by occasional rain showers, but the rainfall is usually minimal. However, the high temperatures and humidity during this period can make outdoor activities uncomfortable. Understanding the seasons and climate zones in Qatar is essential for planning a successful trip, as it allows visitors to choose the best time for their activities and make the most of their stay.

The seasons in Qatar also affect the **tourist crowds** and **prices**. During the peak season, from December to February, tourist attractions and hotels are usually crowded, and prices are at their highest. In contrast, the budget season, from April to May and September to November, offers lower prices and smaller crowds, making it an excellent time for budget-conscious travelers.
