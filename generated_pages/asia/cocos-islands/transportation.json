  "content": "The Cocos Islands offer limited transportation options, but you can get around the islands using a combination of domestic flights, buses, and cars, as well as walking and cycling, given the small size of the territory. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport, CCK\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: none\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe Cocos Islands are accessible by air, with the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport (CCK) being the main entry point. The airport is located on West Island and receives flights from Perth, Australia, which is the primary hub for direct flights to the Cocos Islands. There are no overland entry points, as the islands are located in the Indian Ocean, about 2,770 kilometers northwest of Perth. To get to the Cocos Islands, you typically need to fly to Perth and then take a connecting flight to the Cocos Islands.\n\nThe flight from Perth to the Cocos Islands takes around 4.5 hours, and there are limited flights per week. The primary airline operating flights to the Cocos Islands is Virgin Australia, although other airlines may offer charter flights or seasonal services. It's essential to book your flights well in advance, as the limited number of flights and seats can make it challenging to secure a spot, especially during peak travel seasons.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThere are no domestic flights within the Cocos Islands, as the territory consists of only two inhabited islands, West Island and Home Island, which are connected by a regular ferry service. However, you can take a ferry or a charter boat to travel between the islands. The ferry service operates several times a week and takes around 10-15 minutes to travel between West Island and Home Island. If you're looking to book a charter boat or a ferry, it's best to contact local operators or the Cocos Islands tourism board for more information and to make arrangements in advance.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThe Cocos Islands do not have a rail network, which means that trains are not an option for getting around the islands. The lack of a rail network is due to the small size of the territory and the limited population, making it unnecessary to develop a railway system. As a result, you'll need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, cars, and ferries, to get around the islands.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThere are no commercial bus or coach services on the Cocos Islands, but you can use the local ferry service to travel between West Island and Home Island. Additionally, some resorts and hotels may offer shuttle services for their guests, which can be a convenient way to get around the islands. If you're planning to explore the islands, you may want to consider renting a car or bike, as this will give you more flexibility and freedom to create your own itinerary.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | none | - | not available |\n| City Bus | none | - | not available |\n| Taxi | West Island, Home Island | $5-$10 | limited availability |\n| Ride-Hailing | none | - | not available |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | none | - | not available |\n| Ferry | West Island, Home Island | $5-$10 | regular service |\n| Bike Rental | West Island, Home Island | $10-$20 per day | a popular way to get around |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive on the Cocos Islands, you'll need a valid Australian driver's license or an international driver's license, as the islands are an Australian territory.\n- The road conditions on the islands are generally moderate, with some paved roads and some dirt tracks, so it's essential to drive carefully and slowly.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high due to the remote location of the islands, so it's a good idea to plan your itinerary and minimize your fuel consumption.\n- Car rental options are limited, but you can rent cars, bikes, or scooters from local operators, which can be a convenient way to get around the islands.\n- Hazards on the road include wild animals, such as birds and crabs, as well as potholes and uneven road surfaces, so it's crucial to drive defensively and be aware of your surroundings.\n- It's also important to note that the islands have a **low speed limit** of 40 km/h, which is enforced to protect pedestrians and wildlife.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be sure to book your flights and accommodation well in advance, as the limited number of flights and rooms can make it challenging to find availability, especially during peak travel seasons.\n- Consider renting a car or bike to get around the islands, as this will give you more flexibility and freedom to create your own itinerary.\n- Don't forget to bring **sunscreen** and a **hat**, as the sun can be intense on the islands, and it's essential to protect yourself from the sun's strong rays.\n- Be mindful of the **local environment** and respect any protected areas or wildlife, as the islands are home to a unique and fragile ecosystem.\n- Learn some basic **Malay phrases**, such as \"hello\" (halo) and \"thank you\" (terima kasih), as this will help you interact with the local community and show respect for their culture.\n- Download the **Cocos Islands** app, which provides information on transportation, accommodation, and activities, as well as maps and guides to help you navigate the islands.\n- Be aware of the **limited internet and phone coverage** on the islands, and plan accordingly, as this can be a challenge for some travelers.\n- Respect the **local customs** and traditions, especially when visiting Home Island, which has a strong Malay culture and a **Mosque** that is an important part of the community.",
