  "content": "The Cocos Islands, a territory of Australia, are often misunderstood due to a lack of information and misconceptions about their geography, culture, and economy. \n\n[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nThe Cocos Islands were first discovered by Europeans in 1609 by William Keeling, an English explorer. The islands remained uninhabited until 1826, when John Clunies-Ross, a Scottish sailor, arrived and established a settlement. In 1857, the Cocos Islands were officially declared a British possession, and in 1886, they were annexed to the British Straits Settlements. The islands were transferred to Australia in 1955, and have since been administered as an Australian external territory.

After the war, the Australian government took over the administration of the islands, and in 1978, the Cocos Islands Act was passed, which established the islands as an Australian external territory. The act also provided for the administration of the islands and the rights of the islanders. The Cocos Islands have since been governed by the Australian government, with the Shire of Cocos providing local government services.\n\nThe Cocos Islands have a diverse cultural heritage, with the majority of the population being **Malay** and **European**. The islands have a strong sense of community, with many residents being descended from the original settlers.

The islands have a number of cultural events and festivals throughout the year, including the Cocos Islands Festival, which celebrates the islands' culture and heritage.\n\nThe Cocos Islands have a relatively small population, with a verified population of 593 people, according to the latest census data.
