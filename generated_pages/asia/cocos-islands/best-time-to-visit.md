[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Cocos Islands, located in the Indian Ocean, has a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, from May to October, is marked by calm and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22 to 28 degrees Celsius. This period is ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and fishing. In contrast, the wet season, from November to April, brings heavy rainfall and strong winds, making it less suitable for travel. The islands are also susceptible to cyclones during this time, which can have a significant impact on travel plans.

The dry season is the best time to visit Cocos Islands, as the weather is pleasant and the seas are calm, making it perfect for water activities and exploration of the islands. The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging, with heavy rainfall and strong winds making it difficult to engage in outdoor activities. However, for those who prefer a more relaxed atmosphere and lower prices, the wet season can be a good option.

The climate of Cocos Islands is also influenced by its location in the tropics, with high levels of humidity throughout the year. The temperature remains relatively constant, with average temperatures ranging from 22 to 28 degrees Celsius. The islands' coral reefs and marine life are also affected by the changing seasons, with the dry season being the best time for snorkeling and diving due to the calm and clear waters.
