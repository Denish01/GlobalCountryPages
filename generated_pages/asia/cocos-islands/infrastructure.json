  "content": "The infrastructure in Cocos Islands is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on providing essential services to the small population, despite being a remote territory of Australia.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 80%\nRoad Network: 15 km, good quality\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: 1\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Cocos Islands have a relatively high level of infrastructure development, considering its small population and remote location. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the existing infrastructure, including the road network, airport, and port facilities. The urban-rural gap is not a significant issue, as the population is concentrated on West Island and Home Island, with most services and amenities available on these islands. However, the islands' remote location and limited connectivity to the outside world can pose challenges to maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure.\n\nThe Australian government, as the parent country, provides significant funding and support for infrastructure development in the Cocos Islands. This has enabled the territory to maintain a relatively high standard of living and provide essential services to the population. Despite the challenges, the Cocos Islands have made significant progress in recent years, with investments in renewable energy, water conservation, and telecommunications.\n\nThe Cocos Islands' infrastructure is also influenced by its tourism industry, which is a significant contributor to the local economy. The territory's beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and unique culture attract visitors from around the world, putting pressure on the existing infrastructure. To cater to the growing tourism industry, the government has invested in upgrading the airport, port facilities, and accommodation options, as well as improving the overall tourist experience.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 15 km | Good | Well-maintained roads connect the main settlements and attractions |\n| Railways | none | - | No railway network exists on the islands |\n| Airports | 1 international, 0 domestic | Good | Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport provides regular flights to Perth and Christmas Island |\n| Ports | 1 major | Good | The port on West Island provides cargo and passenger services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The Cocos Islands' power generation is primarily based on diesel-powered generators, with a total capacity of 2.5 MW.\n- The territory has made significant progress in recent years in increasing its **renewable energy** capacity, with a 0.5 MW solar farm and a wind turbine providing a portion of the island's energy needs.\n- The power supply is generally reliable, with an average of 2-3 **power outages** per year, usually due to maintenance or extreme weather events.\n- The Australian government has committed to increasing the use of renewable energy in the Cocos Islands, with a target of 50% of the territory's energy needs to be met by **solar and wind power** by 2025.\n- The Cocos Islands' energy infrastructure is managed by the local electricity authority, which is responsible for maintaining the power grid and ensuring a reliable supply of electricity to the population.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- The Cocos Islands have a relatively well-developed **water supply system**, with a desalination plant and several groundwater wells providing fresh water to the population.\n- **Tap water** is safe to drink, and the water quality is regularly monitored to ensure it meets Australian standards.\n- The territory has a high level of **sanitation coverage**, with modern sewage systems and wastewater treatment facilities in place.\n- The Cocos Islands have implemented **water conservation** measures, including rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse, to reduce the territory's reliance on desalination and groundwater.\n- The Australian government has provided funding and support to upgrade the water and sanitation infrastructure, including the construction of new wastewater treatment facilities and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- The Cocos Islands have a relatively well-developed **telecommunications** network, with mobile phone coverage available on all islands.\n- The territory has **4G mobile coverage**, providing fast and reliable internet access to the population.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available on West Island and Home Island, providing high-speed internet access to residents and businesses.\n- The Cocos Islands have a **postal service**, with regular mail deliveries to and from the islands.\n- The Australian government has committed to upgrading the telecommunications infrastructure, including the installation of a new **submarine cable** to provide faster and more reliable internet access to the territory.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Australian government has committed to investing AUD 20 million in upgrading the Cocos Islands' infrastructure, including the road network, airport, and port facilities.\n- A new **solar farm** is being constructed on West Island, which will provide an additional 1 MW of renewable energy capacity.\n- The Cocos Islands are participating in the Australian government's **National Broadband Network** program, which will provide faster and more reliable internet access to the territory.\n- The territory is implementing a **water conservation** program, which includes the installation of rainwater harvesting systems and greywater reuse facilities.\n- The Australian government has provided funding for the construction of a new **waste management facility**, which will improve the territory's waste management practices and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal.",
