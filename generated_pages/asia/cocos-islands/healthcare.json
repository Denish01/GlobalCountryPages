The public healthcare system is funded by the Australian government, as the Cocos Islands are an external territory of Australia. The quality of care is generally basic, with limited access to specialized medical facilities and equipment. In urban areas, such as West Island, access to healthcare is relatively better, while in rural areas, access is limited. The Cocos Islands Health Service provides basic medical care, including emergency services, general practice, and community health services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Cocos Islands faces challenges due to its remote location and limited resources. Medical staff and equipment are often flown in from Australia, which can lead to delays in treatment. Despite these challenges, the healthcare system in Cocos Islands provides essential medical services to the local population. However, for advanced medical care, patients are often referred to hospitals in Australia, particularly in Perth.\n\nThe Australian government provides significant funding and support to the healthcare system in Cocos Islands, which helps to maintain a basic level of healthcare services. The healthcare system is also supported by the Cocos Islands community, which plays an active role in promoting health and wellbeing. Overall, while the healthcare system in Cocos Islands has its limitations, it provides essential medical services to the local population and relies on the support of the Australian government and the local community.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cocos Islands Health Service | West Island | Public Hospital | General practice, emergency services | Yes |\n| Christmas Island Hospital | Christmas Island | Public Hospital | General practice, emergency services, specialist services | Yes |\n| Royal Perth Hospital | Perth, Australia | Public Hospital | Specialist services, emergency services | Yes |\n| Fiona Stanley Hospital | Perth, Australia | Public Hospital | Specialist services, emergency services | Yes |\n| Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital | Perth, Australia | Public Hospital | Specialist services, emergency services | Yes |\n| St John of God Midland Public Hospital | Perth, Australia | Private Hospital | Specialist services, emergency services | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for visitors and expats, as it provides access to a wider range of medical services and facilities.\n- The Australian government's **Medicare** system provides basic healthcare coverage for Australian citizens and permanent residents, including those living in Cocos Islands.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors, as it provides coverage for emergency medical evacuations and other unexpected medical expenses.\n- **Expats** living in Cocos Islands may be eligible for private health insurance through their employer or can purchase individual policies.\n- **Local insurance options** are limited, and most insurance policies are provided by Australian insurance companies.\n- **Costs** of health insurance vary depending on the type of policy and the level of coverage, but can range from a few hundred to several thousand Australian dollars per year.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Availability of medications** is limited in Cocos Islands, and most medications are flown in from Australia.\n- **Prescription requirements** are similar to those in Australia, and visitors should bring their prescriptions with them when traveling to Cocos Islands.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, but the range of medications is limited compared to larger cities in Australia.\n- **Costs** of medications are generally similar to those in Australia, but may be higher due to the remote location of Cocos Islands.\n- **Pharmacy access** is limited, with only one pharmacy located on West Island, which provides basic pharmaceutical services.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for visitors to Cocos Islands include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid fever.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include influenza, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), and varicella (chickenpox).\n- **Endemic diseases** in Cocos Islands include dengue fever and Ross River virus, which are transmitted by mosquitoes.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and visitors should drink bottled or filtered water to avoid waterborne illnesses.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and visitors should avoid eating undercooked meat, seafood, and raw vegetables.\n- **Sun protection** is essential, as the sun can be intense in Cocos Islands, and visitors should wear protective clothing, hats, and sunscreen.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Cocos Islands, due to the limited availability of medical facilities and services.\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Australia, which may be accessible to visitors to Cocos Islands, include cosmetic surgery, dental procedures, and fertility treatments.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Perth, such as Royal Perth Hospital and Fiona Stanley Hospital, provide a range of medical services and procedures.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists, but visitors should carefully research and compare prices and services before seeking medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 000, which connects callers to the Australian emergency services system.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is limited, and emergency services may be delayed due to the remote location of Cocos Islands.\n- **Nearest hospitals** are located on Christmas Island and in Perth, Australia, which can provide advanced medical care in emergency situations.\n- **Insurance claims** should be made as soon as possible after an emergency, and visitors should keep receipts and records of medical expenses.\n- **Emergency evacuation** may be necessary in severe cases, and visitors should have a plan in place for emergency evacuation to Australia or other countries with advanced medical facilities.",
