[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The primary modes of transportation in Cocos Islands are taxis, bicycles, and walking, as the islands are relatively small and easy to navigate. The quality of public transit is limited, with no formal bus system in place, but most people get around using taxis or by renting bicycles. The islands' small size and lack of traffic make it an ideal place to explore on foot or by bike, with many scenic routes and beaches to discover.

The Cocos Islands are a **territory** of Australia, and as such, the transportation infrastructure is relatively basic, with a focus on serving the local community and tourists. The main island, West Island, has a few shops, restaurants, and amenities, and the majority of the population lives and works there. The lack of a formal public transportation system means that taxis and private vehicles are the primary modes of transportation, although there are some **car rental** options available for tourists.
