The market is primarily driven by the demand from expatriates and government employees who are stationed on the island. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenants have limited rights, and the landlord-tenant relationship is largely governed by the Australian Capital Territory's residential tenancies legislation. Compared to its regional neighbor, Christmas Island, Cocos Islands' housing costs are relatively higher due to its remote location and limited supply of properties.\n\nThe Cocos Islands' housing market is also influenced by the Australian government's policies, which aim to provide affordable housing for its citizens and residents. However, the limited availability of land and the high cost of construction materials and labor contribute to the relatively high cost of housing on the island. Furthermore, the island's remote location and limited access to amenities and services can make it challenging for residents to find affordable and suitable housing. As a result, the Cocos Islands' housing market is characterized by a mix of government-owned and private properties, with a range of prices and amenities available to suit different budgets and needs.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $800-$1,200 | $600-$900 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,500 | $800-$1,200 | fully furnished, modern appliances |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,500-$2,500 | $1,200-$2,000 | family-friendly, spacious living areas |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | luxurious, sea views, private balconies |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $3,500-$5,000 | prime locations, ocean views |\n| Suburbs | $2,500-$3,500 | residential areas, close to amenities |\n| Rural | $1,500-$2,500 | limited availability, large land parcels |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- West Island: $1,200-$2,000 AUD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, close to amenities and services\n- Home Island: $1,000-$1,500 AUD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, traditional Cocos Malay village atmosphere\n- Direction Island: $800-$1,200 AUD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, secluded and peaceful environment\n- North Keeling Island: $600-$900 AUD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, remote and rustic living experience\n- South Point: $1,500-$2,500 AUD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, modern amenities and sea views\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Cocos Islands [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to find the best deals and understand the prices and amenities available\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property and navigate the rental process\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease to ensure it meets your needs and is in good condition\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease to get the best possible deal\n- Be prepared for limited availability and high demand, especially during peak season\n- Consider renting a furnished property to avoid the hassle and cost of purchasing furniture and appliances",
