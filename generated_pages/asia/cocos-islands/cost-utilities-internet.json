The costs of utilities are generally stable, but they can fluctuate depending on the season. For example, during the dry season, water costs may be higher due to increased demand and lower supply. The Cocos Islands' utility costs are also influenced by its reliance on imported goods and services, which can drive up prices.\n\nThe Cocos Islands' government has implemented measures to reduce the territory's reliance on non-renewable energy sources and to promote energy efficiency. As a result, residents can expect to see some variation in their utility bills, especially during peak usage periods. However, overall, the utility costs in Cocos Islands are relatively high compared to other parts of Australia, due to the territory's remote location and limited access to resources.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $100 | $150 | $200 | |\n| Water | $50 | $75 | $100 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in council rates) |\n| **Total** | **$180** | **$270** | **$360** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $60-80 | 30 Mbps | Telstra, Optus |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $100-150 | 100 Mbps | Telstra, Optus |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 1-5 GB | Telstra, Optus |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-20 GB | Telstra, Optus |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $80-150 | varies | Telstra, Optus |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (not available) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Cocos Islands, residents typically need to contact the relevant service providers, such as Telstra or Optus, and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a cost-effective option for residents who want to monitor their energy usage and avoid bill shock.\n- The best internet providers in Cocos Islands are Telstra and Optus, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transport or walking or cycling instead of driving.\n- Residents can also consider installing solar panels or other renewable energy systems to reduce their reliance on non-renewable energy sources and lower their utility bills.",
