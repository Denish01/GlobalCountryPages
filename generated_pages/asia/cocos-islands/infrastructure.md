[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The Cocos Islands have a relatively high level of infrastructure development, considering its small population and remote location. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the existing infrastructure, including the road network, airport, and port facilities. The urban-rural gap is not a significant issue, as the population is concentrated on West Island and Home Island, with most services and amenities available on these islands. However, the islands' remote location and limited connectivity to the outside world can pose challenges to maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure.

The Australian government, as the parent country, provides significant funding and support for infrastructure development in the Cocos Islands. This has enabled the territory to maintain a relatively high standard of living and provide essential services to the population. Despite the challenges, the Cocos Islands have made significant progress in recent years, with investments in renewable energy, water conservation, and telecommunications.

The Cocos Islands' infrastructure is also influenced by its tourism industry, which is a significant contributor to the local economy. The territory's beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and unique culture attract visitors from around the world, putting pressure on the existing infrastructure. To cater to the growing tourism industry, the government has invested in upgrading the airport, port facilities, and accommodation options, as well as improving the overall tourist experience.
