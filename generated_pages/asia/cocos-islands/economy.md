The Cocos Islands economy is classified as a high-income economy, driven primarily by government services and tourism. The territory's development level is relatively high, with access to quality education, healthcare, and infrastructure. However, the economy's small size and remote location make it vulnerable to external shocks. The Cocos Islands' economic trajectory is closely tied to that of Australia, with the Australian government providing significant financial support and oversight. The territory's economy has experienced steady growth in recent years, driven by an increase in tourism and government investment in infrastructure.

The Cocos Islands' economy is also characterized by a high level of dependence on imports, with most goods and services being shipped in from Australia or other countries.

Despite these challenges, the Cocos Islands' economy remains relatively stable, with a low unemployment rate and a high standard of living.

The Cocos Islands' economic classification as a high-income economy is based on its high GDP per capita, which is driven by the territory's small population and high level of government support.
