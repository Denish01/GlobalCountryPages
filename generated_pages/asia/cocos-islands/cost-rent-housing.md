[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Cocos Islands is relatively small, with a limited number of properties available for rent. The market is primarily driven by the demand from expatriates and government employees who are stationed on the island. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenants have limited rights, and the landlord-tenant relationship is largely governed by the Australian Capital Territory's residential tenancies legislation. Compared to its regional neighbor, Christmas Island, Cocos Islands' housing costs are relatively higher due to its remote location and limited supply of properties.

The Cocos Islands' housing market is also influenced by the Australian government's policies, which aim to provide affordable housing for its citizens and residents. However, the limited availability of land and the high cost of construction materials and labor contribute to the relatively high cost of housing on the island. Furthermore, the island's remote location and limited access to amenities and services can make it challenging for residents to find affordable and suitable housing. As a result, the Cocos Islands' housing market is characterized by a mix of government-owned and private properties, with a range of prices and amenities available to suit different budgets and needs.
