[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Cocos Islands is primarily public, with the Australian government providing funding for healthcare services as part of its responsibility as the administering authority. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality, but the range of services available is limited due to the remote location of the islands. Locals and visitors can access public healthcare services, but foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for some services or have private health insurance to cover the costs. The public healthcare system includes a hospital and several health clinics, which provide basic medical care, emergency services, and some specialist services.

For more complex medical conditions or specialized care, patients may need to be evacuated to Perth or other major cities in Australia, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Private healthcare services are limited in Cocos Islands, and most private healthcare providers are based in Australia. As a result, private health insurance that covers evacuation to Australia or other countries may be essential for foreigners living or visiting the islands. It is also important to note that the public healthcare system may not always have the latest medical equipment or technology, and medical staff may not always be available or have the necessary expertise to deal with complex medical cases.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number 000, which will connect you to the public hospital or emergency services. The public hospital has a limited emergency department, and medical staff may not always be available or have the necessary expertise to deal with complex medical cases. For serious medical conditions, evacuation to Perth or other major cities in Australia may be necessary, which can be expensive and time-consuming. It is recommended to have private health insurance that covers evacuation to Australia or other countries in case of a medical emergency. The best hospital for foreigners is the public hospital, which has a limited range of services, but medical staff are generally competent and can provide basic emergency care. However, for more complex medical cases, it is recommended to be evacuated to a major hospital in Australia.
