The Cocos Islands were first discovered by Europeans in 1609 by William Keeling, an English explorer. The islands remained uninhabited until 1826, when John Clunies-Ross, a Scottish sailor, arrived and established a settlement. In 1857, the Cocos Islands were officially declared a British possession, and in 1886, they were annexed to the British Straits Settlements. The islands were transferred to Australia in 1955, and have since been administered as an Australian external territory.

After the war, the Australian government took over the administration of the islands, and in 1978, the Cocos Islands Act was passed, which established the islands as an Australian external territory.
