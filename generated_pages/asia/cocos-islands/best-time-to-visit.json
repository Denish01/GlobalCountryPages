[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nCocos Islands, located in the Indian Ocean, has a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, from May to October, is marked by calm and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22 to 28 degrees Celsius. This period is ideal for outdoor activities such as snorkeling, diving, and fishing.

The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging, with heavy rainfall and strong winds making it difficult to engage in outdoor activities.

The temperature remains relatively constant, with average temperatures ranging from 22 to 28 degrees Celsius. The islands' coral reefs and marine life are also affected by the changing seasons, with the dry season being the best time for snorkeling and diving due to the calm and clear waters.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Hot and humid, occasional rain | Low | $ | Relaxation, low-season activities |\n| February | Hot and humid, occasional rain | Low | $ | Relaxation, low-season activities |\n| March | Hot and humid, increasing rain | Low | $ | Relaxation, low-season activities |\n| April | Warm and sunny, occasional rain | Med | $ | Snorkeling, diving, fishing |\n| May | Warm and sunny, calm seas | Med | $$ | Snorkeling, diving, fishing, outdoor activities |\n| June | Cool and dry, calm seas | High | $$$ | Snorkeling, diving, fishing, outdoor activities, peak season |\n| July | Cool and dry, calm seas | High | $$$ | Snorkeling, diving, fishing, outdoor activities, peak season |\n| August | Cool and dry, calm seas | High | $$$ | Snorkeling, diving, fishing, outdoor activities, peak season |\n| September | Warm and sunny, calm seas | Med | $$ | Snorkeling, diving, fishing, outdoor activities |\n| October | Warm and sunny, occasional rain | Med | $$ | Snorkeling, diving, fishing, outdoor activities |\n| November | Hot and humid, increasing rain | Low | $ | Relaxation, low-season activities |\n| December | Hot and humid, occasional rain | Low | $ | Relaxation, low-season activities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cocos Islands Festival | July | A celebration of the islands' culture, music, and food |\n| Australia Day | January | A national holiday commemorating the founding of Australia |\n| Easter | March/April | A significant holiday in the Christian calendar, often celebrated with church services and family gatherings |\n| Ramadan | May/June | A significant holiday in the Islamic calendar, observed by the Muslim community on the islands |\n| Cocos Islands Regatta | August | A sailing competition that attracts visitors from around the world |\n| Christmas Island and Cocos Islands Expo | November | An exhibition showcasing the culture, products, and services of the two islands |\n| Cocos Islands Marine Conservation Week | September | A week-long event promoting marine conservation and sustainability |\n| Cocos Islands Sports Day | October | A day of sports competitions and activities, promoting health and fitness |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **North Keeling Island** is less affected by the wet season, making it a good option for travelers who prefer to visit during this time.\n- The **West Island** is more developed and has a wider range of amenities, making it a popular choice for visitors during the peak season.\n- The ** Direction Island** is a good spot for snorkeling and diving, with calm and clear waters during the dry season.\n- The **Horsburgh Island** is a remote and uninhabited island, making it a challenging destination to visit, especially during the wet season.\n- The **Pulu Keeling National Park** is a protected area that is home to a wide range of marine life, and is best visited during the dry season when the seas are calm.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and limited availability.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to May or September to November, when prices are lower and the weather is still pleasant.\n- Pack **lightweight and breathable clothing**, as well as **sunscreen and insect repellent**, to protect yourself from the sun and insects.\n- Be aware of the **cyclone season**, from November to April, and check the weather forecast before traveling to the islands.\n- Respect the **local culture and environment**, and follow any guidelines or regulations to minimize your impact on the islands' ecosystem.\n- Plan your trip around the **Australian school holidays**, when prices may be higher and the islands may be more crowded.",
