They are part of the Australian external territory and are not bordered by any country, but their nearest neighbor is Christmas Island, which is also an Australian external territory. The islands are surrounded by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, which provides a unique and diverse marine ecosystem. The Cocos Islands are a small archipelago, consisting of 27 coral islands, with the two main islands being West Island and Home Island.\n\nThe Cocos Islands are strategically located near major shipping lanes, which has made them an important stopover for sailors and traders throughout history. However, their remote location has also made them vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and increased storm activity. The islands are also susceptible to tsunamis and cyclones, which can have devastating effects on the small population and infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the Cocos Islands remain a popular destination for tourists and travelers looking to experience the unique culture and natural beauty of the region.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nThe Cocos Islands are a coral atoll, with a total land area of approximately 14 square kilometers. The islands are low-lying, with the highest point being only 9 meters above sea level. The terrain is generally flat, with sandy beaches and coral reefs surrounding the islands. The interior of the islands is covered in dense vegetation, including coconut trees, pandanus, and other tropical plants. The islands are also home to a number of freshwater lakes and wetlands, which provide a habitat for a variety of birds and other wildlife.\n\nThe Cocos Islands are surrounded by a coral reef, which provides a habitat for a diverse range of marine life, including fish, turtles, and coral. The reef is also an important breeding ground for a number of species, including the green turtle and the hawksbill turtle. The islands themselves are also home to a number of unique and endemic species, including the Cocos buff-banded rail and the Cocos partridge. The unique combination of coral reefs, sandy beaches, and tropical vegetation makes the Cocos Islands a unique and fascinating destination for tourists and travelers.\n\nThe islands' geography is also characterized by its **coral cay** formations, which are small, sandy islands that have formed on top of the coral reef. These cays are an important habitat for a number of species, including seabirds and turtles. The Cocos Islands are also home to a number of **beaches**, including the popular **Cabbage Beach** on West Island, which is known for its crystal-clear waters and white sandy beach.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Summer | December to February | 28-32°C | high | hot and humid |\n| Autumn | March to May | 25-30°C | moderate | warm and sunny |\n| Winter | June to August | 22-28°C | low | mild and dry |\n| Spring | September to November | 25-30°C | moderate | warm and sunny |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: April to October.
