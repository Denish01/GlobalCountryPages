The islands are not officially divided into administrative regions or states, but rather are managed as a single entity by the Australian government. The Shire of Cocos, established in 1993, is the local government body responsible for providing services to the community, but it does not have the same powers as local governments in Australia.\n\nThe lack of formal administrative divisions reflects the small population and relatively simple governance structure of the islands. The Australian government provides support and services, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure, to the community. The local government, the Shire of Cocos, focuses on providing local services, such as waste management, recreation facilities, and community programs. The Shire also plays a role in promoting the islands' unique culture and environment, and in supporting local businesses and tourism initiatives.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**West Island** (population 120)\nRole: capital, economic hub\nKnown For: West Island is the hub of the Cocos Islands, with the airport, shops, and government services located here.
