  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Cocos Islands can vary significantly depending on whether you are using public or private healthcare services, with public services generally being more affordable but with limited availability and quality.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $4,445 (World Bank figure)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 24.6% (World Bank figure)\nHealthcare System: Public\nEmergency Number: 000\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: AUD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Cocos Islands is primarily public, with the Australian government providing funding for healthcare services as part of its responsibility as the administering authority. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality, but the range of services available is limited due to the remote location of the islands. Locals and visitors can access public healthcare services, but foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for some services or have private health insurance to cover the costs. The public healthcare system includes a hospital and several health clinics, which provide basic medical care, emergency services, and some specialist services.\n\nFor more complex medical conditions or specialized care, patients may need to be evacuated to Perth or other major cities in Australia, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Private healthcare services are limited in Cocos Islands, and most private healthcare providers are based in Australia. As a result, private health insurance that covers evacuation to Australia or other countries may be essential for foreigners living or visiting the islands. It is also important to note that the public healthcare system may not always have the latest medical equipment or technology, and medical staff may not always be available or have the necessary expertise to deal with complex medical cases.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Limited availability of private GPs |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Limited availability of specialists |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Limited availability of private dentists |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Limited availability of private optometrists |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | Limited availability of private laboratories |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Limited availability of emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$500 | Limited availability of private hospital rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$3,000 | Limited availability of surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,500 | Limited availability of obstetric services |\n| MRI Scan | $500-$1,000 | Limited availability of diagnostic imaging services |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Limited availability of diagnostic imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public hospital services, basic medical care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private hospital services, specialist care, evacuation to Australia |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Private hospital services, specialist care, evacuation to any country |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication is available at the public hospital and some private pharmacies, but the range of medications available may be limited.\n- Over-the-counter medications are available at some private pharmacies and the public hospital.\n- The cost of prescription medication can range from $10 to $50 per prescription, depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy.\n- Some medications may need to be ordered from Australia, which can take several days to arrive.\n- Pharmacists may not always be available, and some medications may not be stocked due to the remote location of the islands.\n- It is recommended to bring any essential medications with you when visiting the islands, as well as a copy of your prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number 000, which will connect you to the public hospital or emergency services. The public hospital has a limited emergency department, and medical staff may not always be available or have the necessary expertise to deal with complex medical cases. For serious medical conditions, evacuation to Perth or other major cities in Australia may be necessary, which can be expensive and time-consuming. It is recommended to have private health insurance that covers evacuation to Australia or other countries in case of a medical emergency. The best hospital for foreigners is the public hospital, which has a limited range of services, but medical staff are generally competent and can provide basic emergency care. However, for more complex medical cases, it is recommended to be evacuated to a major hospital in Australia.",
