[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The Cocos Islands have a relatively small and stable population, with a slow growth rate due to limited job opportunities and a lack of access to education and healthcare. The population is mostly concentrated in the capital, West Island, and the nearby Home Island, with a significant proportion of residents living in urban areas.

However, there is a small but significant diaspora community, mainly in Australia and other parts of Asia.

The islands' history as a British colony and later as an Australian territory has shaped the population's demographic profile, with a significant proportion of residents holding Australian citizenship. The population is also relatively young, with a median age of 35 years, and a high fertility rate, which has contributed to the slow but steady growth of the population over the years.
