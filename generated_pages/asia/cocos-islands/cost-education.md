[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Cocos Islands is based on the Australian curriculum, with English as the primary language of instruction. The public education system provides free or subsidized education to all residents, with a focus on providing a well-rounded education to students from kindergarten to year 12. The quality of public education is generally good, with a strong emphasis on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and English. However, the limited resources and remote location of the islands can sometimes impact the quality of education, particularly in terms of access to specialized subjects and facilities.

Private and international schools are not readily available in Cocos Islands, due to the small population and remote location. However, some private schools may offer distance education or online learning options, which can provide students with access to a wider range of subjects and resources. The language of instruction in private and international schools is typically English, although some schools may offer bilingual or multilingual programs. Compulsory education in Cocos Islands lasts for 12 years, from age 5 to 17, and is divided into primary and secondary education.
