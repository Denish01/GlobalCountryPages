The internet quality in Cocos Islands is generally slow, with average download speeds of 10 Mbps, which can be frustrating for those who need to stay connected for work or other purposes.

However, the reliability of the internet can be a problem, with frequent outages and slow speeds, especially during peak hours or bad weather. The internet infrastructure in Cocos Islands is still developing, and the territory relies on satellite connections, which can be affected by weather conditions and other factors.

The limited internet options and slow speeds can make it challenging for visitors to stay connected, especially for those who need to work remotely or stream content. However, the local authorities and internet service providers are working to improve the internet infrastructure, including the installation of new fiber-optic cables and the upgrade of existing networks. Despite these efforts, the internet in Cocos Islands remains relatively limited, and visitors should be prepared for slow speeds and occasional outages.
